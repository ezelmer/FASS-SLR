We analysed the liver function indexes of COVID-19 patients to explore the characteristics of liver function changes in patients with different severity.\n\nMethodsThis study included 54 moderate, 50 severe, and 31 death nucleic acid-confirmed COVID-19 patients hospitalized at the central hospital of Wuhan, China. Epidemiological histories, clinical features, imaging materials, medications and especially major liver function laboratory tests were collected for analysis.\n\nResultsThe clinical symptoms did not present any significant difference in the patients at admission, but the older male patients had pronounced mortality risk. The normal ratio of ALT, TB, and DBIL of moderate patients was 96.3%, 94.44%, and 98.15% separately at the first test, but 59.26% of patients showed declined ALB levels. The normal ratio of all liver function indexes declined after admission, but most abnormalities were mild (1-2 times of upper limit unit) and went back normal before discharge. In severe patients, the normal ratio of ALB dropped down to 30.61% at admission along with the dramatic impaired normal ratio of bilirubin at the second test. The severe patients liver function dysfunction was worse than the moderate patients but without a significant difference. The dead patients showed a significantly higher level of DBIL, AST, GGT and CRP than other groups patients in the final test, along with the hypoalbuminemia. What is worse, 16.13% of non-survivors were diagnosed with liver failure. No medication was found to be related to ALT, AST, and GGT abnormality in our study.\n\nConclusionIn moderate and severe patients, liver dysfunction was mild. Patients widely presented lower level of ALB. The higher level of bilirubin, AST, and GGT was likely to indicate the worse outcome. Dynamic monitoring of liver function indexes could be considered and liver failure related death should be noticed and prevented in the early stage.

COVID-19: analysis of 18 cases].","abstract":"OBJECTIVE To analyze the clinical characteristics of patients with severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) receiving tracheal intubation.\n METHODS We analyzed clinical characteristics of 18 severely or critically ill patients with COVID-19 undergoing tracheal intubation.\n The general demographic and clinical data of the patients including their age, gender, pre- intubation state of consciousness and the ventilation mode were recorded.\n The anesthesiologists performing the tracheal intubation procedure evaluated and recorded the tracheal intubation conditions of the patients.\n The changes in the vital signs of the patients before anesthesia induction and after intubation were recorded.\n RESULTS The average ages of these patients were 70.39±8.02 years.\n Fifteen patients (83.33%) received non- invasive ventilation before tracheal intubation, and 13 patients (72.22%) were conscious before tracheal intubation.\n After induction of anesthesia, the blood pressure and heart rate of the patients decreased significantly (P < 0.05).\n Most of the patients (94.44%) were in excellent or good conditions for tracheal intubation, and the first-attempt success rate of tracheal intubation was 100%.\n Five patients died within 3 weeks following the intubation.\n Tracheotomy was performed in one patient.\n Twelve patients were still on endotracheal mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit, and one of them received ECMO treatment due to poor oxygenation.\n A total of 16 experienced anesthesiologists participated in tracheal intubation, all with third-level protection during the operation, and no medical staff infection has been detected so far.\n CONCLUSIONS For patients with severe and critical COVID-19 and indications of tracheal intubation, we recommend early intubation with invasive respiratory support to improve the treatment efficacy and reduce the mortality.\n Anesthetic agents should be used carefully during tracheal intubation to ensure patients' safety.\n The medical staff should have a high-level protection during the intubation to maximally ensure their safety.\n","id":"10.12122/j.issn.1673-4254.2020.03.07","idformat":"ELASTIC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"

single-centered, retrospective, observational study","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_elsevier_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xiaobo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"

and 59.7% had no signs of infection.\n\n Only 3.6% of patients required an ICU admission and 1.7% were dead at the study's cutoff date.\n\n On multivariable analysis, the risk factors found to be significantly associated with admission to intensive care were age above 50 years old, a qSOFA score above 0, smoking, elevated CRP and elevated procalcitonin levels.\n\n Asthma, smoking and elevated procalcitonin levels correlated significantly with mortality in our cohort.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7335246","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_elsevier_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Sulaiman","surname":"Almazeedi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"

onset had a bimodal distribution, with modes at three to four days, and at nine days.\n\n As of 30 April, 90 patients remained in hospital and 211 had died in hospital.\n\n\nConclusions\nPatients admitted to hospital with covid-19 at this medical center faced major morbidity and mortality, with high rates of acute kidney injury and inpatient dialysis, prolonged intubations, and a bimodal distribution of time to intubation from symptom onset.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7256651","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Michael

syndrome-CoV-2 disease who were admitted to an ICU during the study period.\n\n\nInterventions:\nNone.\n\n\nMeasurements and Main Results:\nAmong 217 critically ill patients, mortality for those who required mechanical ventilation was 35.7% (59/165), with 4.8% of patients (8/165) still on the ventilator at the time of this report.\n\n Overall mortality to date in this critically ill cohort is 30.9% (67/217) and 60.4% (131/217) patients have survived to hospital discharge.\n\n Mortality was significantly associated with older age, lower body mass index, chronic renal disease, higher

patients with covid-19 pneumonia who require oxygen: observational comparative study using routine care data","abstract":"Objective\nTo assess the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine in patients admitted to hospital with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pneumonia who require oxygen.\n\n\nDesign\nComparative observational study using data collected from routine care.\n\n\nSetting\nFour French tertiary care centres providing care to patients with covid-19 pneumonia between 12 March and 31 March 2020.\nParticipants\n181 patients aged 18-80 years with documented severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia who required oxygen but not intensive care.\n\n\nInterventions\nHydroxychloroquine at a dose of 600 mg/day within 48 hours of admission to hospital (treatment group) versus standard care without hydroxychloroquine (control group).\n\n\nMain outcome measures\nThe primary outcome was survival without transfer to the intensive care unit at day 21. Secondary outcomes were overall survival, survival without acute respiratory distress syndrome, weaning from oxygen, and discharge from hospital to home or rehabilitation (all at day 21).\n\n Analyses were adjusted for confounding factors by inverse probability of treatment weighting.\n\n\nResults\nIn the main analysis, 84 patients who received hydroxychloroquine within 48 hours of admission to hospital (treatment group) were compared with 89 patients who did not receive hydroxychloroquine (control group).\n\n Eight additional patients received hydroxychloroquine more than 48 hours after admission.\n\n In the weighted analyses, the survival rate without transfer to the intensive care unit at day 21 was 76% in the treatment group and 75% in the control group (weighted hazard ratio 0.9, 95% confidence interval 0.4 to 2.1).\n\n Overall survival at day 21 was 89% in the treatment group and 91% in the control group (1.2, 0.4 to 3.3).\n\n Survival without acute respiratory distress syndrome at day 21 was 69% in the treatment group compared with 74% in the control group (1.3, 0.7 to 2.6).\n\n At day 21, 82% of patients in the treatment group had been weaned from oxygen compared with 76% in the control group (weighted risk ratio 1.1, 95% confidence interval 0.9 to 1.3).\n\n Eight patients in the treatment group (10%) experienced electrocardiographic modifications that required discontinuation of treatment.\n\n\nConclusions\nHydroxychloroquine has received worldwide attention as a potential treatment for covid-19 because of positive results from small studies.\n\n However, the results of this study do not support its use in patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 who require oxygen.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7221472","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Matthieu","surname":"Mahévas","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"

coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are regularly complicated by respiratory failure.\n\n Although it has been suggested that elevated levels of blood neutrophils associate with worsening oxygenation in COVID-19, it is unknown whether neutrophils are drivers of the thrombo-inflammatory storm or simple bystanders.\n\n To better understand the potential role of neutrophils in COVID-19, we measured levels of the neutrophil activation marker S100A8/A9 (calprotectin) in hospitalized patients and determined its relationship to severity of illness and respiratory status.\n\n Patients with COVID-19 (n = 172) had markedly elevated levels of calprotectin in their blood.\n\n Calprotectin tracked with other acute phase reactants including C-reactive protein, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, and absolute neutrophil count, but was superior in identifying patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n In longitudinal samples, calprotectin rose as oxygenation worsened.\n\n When tested on day 1 or 2 of hospitalization (n = 94 patients), calprotectin levels were significantly higher in patients who progressed to severe COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation (8039 ± 7031 ng/ml, n = 32) as compared to those who remained free of intubation (3365 ± 3146, P &lt; 0.0001).\n\n In summary, serum calprotectin levels track closely with current and future COVID-19 severity, implicating neutrophils as potential perpetuators of inflammation and respiratory compromise in COVID-19.","id":"PMC7902293","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"
