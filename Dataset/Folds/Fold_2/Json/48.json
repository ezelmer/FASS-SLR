We prospectively collected data on demographics, symptoms, Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality/Synergy Between PCI with Taxus and Cardiac Surgery (STS?PROM/SYNTAX) scores, mode of revascularization, and outcomes.\n\n Mean age was 70.0 years; 122 (73.5%) patients were male.\n\n Prevalent comorbidities included diabetes mellitus (51.8%), peripheral artery disease (38.6%), atrial fibrillation (27.1%), end?stage renal disease on dialysis (13.3%), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (21.7%).\n\n Eighty?seven (52.4%) patients had New York Heart Association III?IV and 112 (67.5%) had Canadian Cardiovascular Society III?IV symptomatology.\n\n Sixty?seven (40.4%) patients had left main and 118 (71.1%) had 3?vessel coronary artery disease.\n\n The median STS?PROM was 3.6% (interquartile range 1.9, 8.0) and SYNTAX score was 26 (interquartile range 20, 34).\n\n The median number of physicians per Heart Team meeting was 6 (interquartile range 5, 8).\n\n Seventy?nine (47.6%) and 49 (29.5%) patients underwent percutaneous coronary intervention and coronary artery bypass grafting, respectively.\n\n With increasing STS?PROM (low, intermediate, high operative risk), coronary artery bypass graft was performed less often (47.9%, 18.5%, 15.2%) and optimal medical therapy was recommended more often (11.3%, 18.5%, 30.3%).\n\n There were no trends in recommendation for coronary artery bypass graft, percutaneous coronary intervention, or optimal medical therapy by SYNTAX score tertiles.\n\n In?hospital and 30?day mortality was 3.9% and 4.8%, respectively.\n\n\nConclusions\nIntegrating a multidisciplinary Heart Team into institutional practice is feasible and provides a formalized approach to evaluating complex coronary artery disease patients.\n\n The comprehensive assessment of surgical, anatomical, and other risk scores using a decision aid may guide appropriate, evidence?based management within this team?based construct.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7428540","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"John Wiley and Sons Inc.","authors":[{"firstname":"Michael

the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing Municipal Science and Technology

Wuhan University from January 1st to February 5th.\n\n The cases were divided into general and refractory COVID-19 groups according to the clinical efficacy after hospitalization, and the difference between groups were compared.\n\n\nResults\nCompared with general COVID-19 patients (45.2%), refractory patients had an older age, male sex, more underlying comorbidities, lower incidence of fever, higher levels of maximum temperature among fever cases, higher incidence of breath shortness and anorexia, severer disease assessment on admission, high levels of neutrophil, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and C-reactive protein, lower levels of platelets and albumin, and higher incidence of bilateral pneumonia and pleural effusion (P&lt;0.05).\n\n Refractory COVID-19 patients were more likely to receive oxygen, mechanical ventilation, expectorant, and adjunctive treatment including corticosteroid, antiviral drugs and immune enhancer (P&lt;0.05).\n\n After adjustment, those with refractory COVID-19 were also more likely to have a male sex and manifestations of anorexia and fever on admission, and receive oxygen, expectorant and adjunctive agents (P&lt;0.05) when considering the factors of disease severity on admission, mechanical ventilation, and ICU transfer.\n\n\nConclusion\nNearly 50% COVID-19 patients could not reach obvious clinical and radiological remission within 10 days after hospitalization.\n\n The patients with male sex, anorexia and no fever on admission predicted poor efficacy.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7184444","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"Oxford University

the puncture zone of the artery during transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement and may decrease major vascular complications (VC) and life?threatening or major bleeding complications.\n\n This study aimed to evaluate the clinical impact of US guidance using a propensity score–matched comparison.\n\n\nMethods and Results\n\nUS guidance was implemented as the default approach for all transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement cases in our institution in June 2013. We defined 3 groups of consecutive patients according to the method of puncture (fluoroscopic/US guidance) and the use of a transcatheter heart valve.\n\n Patients in the US?guided second?generation group (Sapien XT [Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA], Corevalve [Medtronic, Dublin, Ireland]) were successfully 1:1 matched with patients in the fluoroscope?guided second?generation group (n=95) with propensity score matching.\n\n In a second analysis we described the consecutive patients of the US?guided third?generation group (Evolut?R [Medtronic], Sapien 3 [Edwards Lifesciences], n=308).\n\n All vascular and bleeding complications were reduced in the US?guided second?generation group compared with the fluoroscope?guided second?generation group: VC (16.8% versus 6.3%; P=0.023); life?threatening or major bleeding (22.1% versus 6%; P=0.004); and VC related to vascular access (12.6% versus 4.2%; P=0.052).\n\n In the US?guided third?generation group the rates of major VC and life?threatening or major bleeding were 3.2% (95% CI, 1.6% to 5.9%) and 3.6% (95% CI, 1.8% to 6.3%).\n\n In the overall population (n=546), life?threatening or major bleeding was associated with a 1.7?fold increased mortality risk (P=0.02).\n\n\nConclusions\nWe demonstrated that US guidance effectively reduced VC and bleeding complications for transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement and should be considered the standard puncture method.\n\n\nRegistration\n\nURL: http://www.\n\nclinicaltrials.\n\ngov.\n\n Unique identifier: NCT02628509.\n","id":"PMC7335526","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"John Wiley and Sons Inc.","authors":[{"firstname":"Flavien","surname":"Vincent","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Hugues","surname":"Spillemaeker","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Maéva","surname":"Kyheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Cassandre","surname":"Belin?Vincent","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Cédric","surname":"Delhaye","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Adeline","surname":"Piérache","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Tom","surname":"Denimal","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Basile","surname":"Verdier","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Nicolas","surname":"Debry","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Mouhamed","surname":"Moussa","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Guillaume","surname":"Schurtz","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Sina","surname":"Porouchani","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Alessandro","surname":"Cosenza","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Francis","surname":"Juthier","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Thibault","surname":"Pamart","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Marjorie","surname":"Richardson","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Augustin","surname":"Coisne","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Adrien","surname":"Hertault","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Jonathan","surname":"Sobocinski","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Thomas","surname":"Modine","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" François","surname":"Pontana","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Alain","surname":"Duhamel","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Julien","surname":"Labreuche","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Eric","surname":"Van Belle","email":"ericvanbelle@aol.com","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1001/jama.2020.1585","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Unknown Title","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1186/s13054-020-02895-6","date":"2020-04-14","title":"Clinical course and outcome of 107 patients infected with the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, discharged from two hospitals in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>In December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak was reported from Wuhan, China.\n\n Information on the clinical course and prognosis of COVID-19 was not thoroughly described.\n\n We described the clinical courses and prognosis in COVID-19 patients.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>Retrospective case series of COVID-19 patients from Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University in Wuhan and Xishui Hospital, Hubei Province, China, up to February 10, 2020.

COVID-19 treated in Hubei (epicentre) and outside Hubei (non-epicentre): a nationwide analysis of China","abstract":"Background\nDuring the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), consistent and considerable differences in disease severity and mortality rate of patients treated in Hubei province compared to those in other parts of China have been observed.\n\n We sought to compare the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients being treated inside and outside Hubei province, and explore the factors underlying these differences.\n\n\nMethods\nCollaborating with the National Health Commission, we established a retrospective cohort to study hospitalised COVID-19 cases in China.\n\n Clinical characteristics, the rate of severe events and deaths, and the time to critical illness (invasive ventilation or intensive care unit admission or death) were compared between patients within and outside Hubei.\n\n The impact of Wuhan-related exposure (a presumed key factor that drove the severe situation in Hubei, as Wuhan is the epicentre as well the administrative centre of Hubei province) and the duration between symptom onset and admission on prognosis were also determined.\n\n\nResults\nAt the data cut-off (31 January 2020), 1590 cases from 575 hospitals in 31 provincial administrative regions were collected (core cohort).\n\n The overall rate of severe cases and mortality was 16.0% and 3.2%, respectively.\n\n Patients in Hubei (predominantly with Wuhan-related exposure, 597 (92.3%) out of 647) were older (mean age 49.7 versus 44.9?years), had more cases with comorbidity (32.9% versus 19.7%), higher symptomatic burden, abnormal radiologic manifestations and, especially, a longer waiting time between symptom onset and admission (5.7 versus 4.5?days) compared with patients outside Hubei.\n\n Patients in Hubei (severe event rate 23.0% versus 11.1%, death rate 7.3% versus 0.3%, HR (95% CI) for critical illness 1.59 (1.05–2.41)) have a poorer prognosis compared with patients outside Hubei after adjusting for age and comorbidity.\n\n However, among patients outside Hubei, the duration from symptom onset to hospitalisation (mean 4.4 versus 4.7?days) and prognosis (HR (95%) 0.84 (0.40–1.80)) were similar between patients with or without Wuhan-related exposure.\n\n In the overall population, the waiting time, but neither treated in Hubei nor Wuhan-related exposure, remained an independent prognostic factor (HR (95%) 1.05 (1.01–1.08)).\n\n\nConclusion\nThere were more severe cases and poorer outcomes for COVID-19 patients treated in Hubei, which might be attributed to the prolonged duration of symptom onset to hospitalisation in the epicentre.\n\n Future studies to determine the reason for delaying hospitalisation are warranted.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7144336","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"European Respiratory
