wards for patients with COVID-19 in multiple regions of China, a considerable proportion of health care workers reported experiencing symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress,

been sustained in China since December 2019, and has become a pandemic.\n The mental health of frontline medical staff is a concern.\n In this study, we aimed to identify the factors influencing medical worker anxiety in China during the COVID-19 outbreak.\n We conducted a cross-sectional study to estimate the prevalence of anxiety among medical staff in China from 10 February 2020 to 20 February 2020 using the Zung Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) to assess anxiety, with the criteria of normal (?49), mild (50–59), moderate (60–70) and severe anxiety (?70).\n We used multivariable linear regression to determine the factors (e.\ng.\n having direct contact when treating infected patients, being a medical staff worker from Hubei province, being a suspect case) for anxiety.\n We also used adjusted models to confirm independent factors for anxiety after adjusting for gender, age, education and marital status.\n Of 512 medical staff in China, 164 (32.03%) had had direct contact treating infected patients.\n The prevalence of anxiety was 12.5%, with 53 workers suffering from mild (10.35%), seven workers suffering from moderate (1.36%) and four workers suffering from severe anxiety (0.78%).\n After adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics (gender, age, education and marital status), medical staff who had had direct contact treating infected patients experienced higher anxiety scores than those who had not had direct contact (? value = 2.33, confidence interval (CI) 0.65–4.00; P = 0.0068).\n A similar trend was observed in medical staff from Hubei province, compared with those from other parts of China (? value = 3.67, CI 1.44–5.89; P = 0.0013).\n The most important variable was suspect cases with high anxiety scores, compared to non-suspect cases (? value = 4.44, CI 1.55–7.33; P = 0.0028).\n In this survey of hospital medical workers during the COVID-19 outbreak in China, we found that study participants experienced anxiety symptoms, especially those who had direct clinical contact with infected patients; as did those in the worst affected areas, including Hubei province; and those who were suspect cases.\n Governments and healthcare authorities should proactively implement appropriate psychological intervention programmes, to prevent, alleviate or treat increased anxiety.\n","id":"PMC7251286","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"Cambridge University

of anxiety and depression symptoms among nurses was 27.9% and 43.0%, respectively.\n\n History of depression or anxiety was a common risk factor for anxiety symptoms (T=-3.635, p=0.000, 95%CI: -16.360~-4.789) and depression symptoms (T=-2.835, p=0.005, 95%CI:-18.238~-3.254) in nurses.\n\n The results of partial correlation analysis (controlled for gender and history of depression or anxiety) indicated that the total score of positive coping was negatively correlated with the total score of anxiety (r=-0.182, p=0.002) and depression (r=-0.253, p=0.001).\n\n\nConclusions\nThe first-line anti-epidemic medical staff have high anxiety and depression symptoms and adopting positive coping styles will help to improve their negative emotions.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7202136","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"Frontiers Media S.A.","authors":[{"firstname":"Juhong","surname":"Zhu","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"

physician trainees represent a unique group—functioning simultaneously as both learners and caregivers and experiencing considerable challenges during the pandemic.\n However, we have a limited understanding regarding the emotional effects and vulnerability experienced by trainees during the pandemic.\n We investigated the effects of trainee exposure to patients being tested for COVID-19 on their depression, anxiety, stress, burnout and professional fulfillment.\n All physician trainees at an academic medical center (n = 1375) were invited to participate in an online survey.\n We compared the measures of depression, anxiety, stress, burnout and professional fulfillment among trainees who were exposed to patients being tested for COVID-19 and those that were not, using univariable and multivariable models.\n We also evaluated perceived life stressors such as childcare, home schooling, personal finances and work-family balance among both groups.\n 393 trainees completed the survey (29% response rate).\n Compared to the non-exposed group, the exposed group had a higher prevalence of stress (29.4% vs.\n 18.9%), and burnout (46.3% vs.\n 33.7%).\n The exposed group also experienced moderate to extremely high perceived stress regarding childcare and had a lower work-family balance.\n Multivariable models indicated that trainees who were exposed to COVID-19 patients reported significantly higher stress (10.96 [95% CI, 9.65 to 12.46] vs 8.44 [95% CI, 7.3 to 9.76]; P = 0.043) and were more likely to be burned out (1.31 [95% CI, 1.21 to1.41] vs 1.07 [95% CI, 0.96 to 1.19]; P = 0.002].\n We also found that female trainees were more likely to be stressed (P = 0.043); while unmarried trainees were more likely to be depressed (P = 0.009), and marginally more likely to have anxiety (P = 0.051).\n To address these challenges, wellness programs should focus on sustaining current programs, develop new and targeted mental health resources that are widely accessible and devise strategies for creating awareness regarding these resources.\n","id":"PMC7410237","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"Public Library of
