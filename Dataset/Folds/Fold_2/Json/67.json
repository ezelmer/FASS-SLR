in Homeless Shelters in Chicago, Illinois—March–May, 2020","abstract":"Background\nPeople experiencing homelessness are at increased risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but little is known about specific risk factors for infection within homeless shelters.\n\n \nMethods\nWe performed widespread severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) polymerase chain reaction testing and collected risk factor information at all homeless shelters in Chicago with at least 1 reported case of COVID-19 (n = 21).\n\n Multivariable, mixed-effects log-binomial models were built to estimate adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) for SARS-CoV-2 infection for both individual- and facility-level risk factors.\n\n \nResults\nDuring March 1 to May 1, 2020, 1717 shelter residents and staff were tested for SARS-CoV-2; 472 (27%) persons tested positive.\n\n Prevalence of infection was higher for residents (431 of 1435, 30%) than for staff (41 of 282, 15%) (prevalence ratio = 2.52; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.78–3.58).\n\n The majority of residents with SARS-CoV-2 infection (293 of 406 with available information about symptoms, 72%) reported no symptoms at the time of specimen collection or within the following 2 weeks.\n\n Among residents, sharing a room with a large number of people was associated with increased likelihood of infection (aPR for sharing with &gt;20 people compared with single rooms = 1.76; 95% CI, 1.11–2.80), and current smoking was associated with reduced likelihood of infection (aPR = 0.71; 95% CI, 0.60–0.85).\n\n At the facility level, a higher proportion of residents leaving and returning each day was associated with increased prevalence (aPR = 1.08; 95% CI, 1.01–1.16), whereas an increase in the number of private bathrooms was associated with reduced prevalence (aPR for 1 additional private bathroom per 100 people = 0.92; 95% CI, 0.87–0.98).\n\n \nConclusions\nWe identified a high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections in homeless shelters.\n\n Reducing the number of residents sharing dormitories might reduce the likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n When community transmission is high, limiting movement of persons experiencing homelessness into and out of shelters might also be beneficial.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7665740","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"Oxford University

countries and regions in Asia Pacific and Europe","abstract":"The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented global crisis.\n Many countries have implemented restrictions on population movement to slow the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and prevent health systems from becoming overwhelmed; some have instituted full or partial lockdowns.\n However, lockdowns and other extreme restrictions cannot be sustained for the long term in the hope that there will be an effective vaccine or treatment for COVID-19. Governments worldwide now face the common challenge of easing lockdowns and restrictions while balancing various health, social, and economic concerns.\n To facilitate cross-country learning, this Health Policy paper uses an adapted framework to examine the approaches taken by nine high-income countries and regions that have started to ease COVID-19 restrictions: five in the Asia Pacific region (ie, Hong Kong [Special Administrative Region], Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea) and four in Europe (ie, Germany, Norway, Spain, and the UK).\n This comparative analysis presents important lessons to be learnt from the experiences of these countries and regions.\n Although the future of the virus is unknown at present, countries should continue to share their experiences, shield populations who are at risk, and suppress transmission to save lives.\n","id":"PMC7515628","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"Elsevier

COVID-19 exposure prevalence in this group.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did a cross-sectional seroprevalence study at food distribution sites, emergency shelters, and workers' residences that were provided medical services by Médecins Sans Frontières in Paris and Seine-Saint-Denis in the Ile-de-France region.\n\n Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody seropositivity was detected by Luciferase-Linked Immunosorbent Assay and Pseudo Neutralization Test.\n\n Sociodemographic and exposure related information was collected via a verbal questionnaire to analyse risk factors and associations with various COVID-19 symptoms.\n\n\nFindings\nBetween June 23 and July 2, 2020, 426 (52%) of 818 individuals recruited tested positive in 14 sites.\n\n Seroprevalence varied significantly by type of recruitment site (?2 p&lt;0·0001), being highest among those living in workers' residences (88·7%, 95% CI 81·8–93·2), followed by emergency shelters (50·5%, 46·3–54·7), and food distribution sites (27·8%, 20·8–35·7).\n\n More than two thirds of COVID-19 seropositive individuals (68%, 95% CI 64·2–72·2; 291 of 426) did not report any symptoms during the recall period.\n\n COVID-19 seropositivity was strongly associated with overcrowding (medium density: adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2·7, 95% CI 1·5–5·1, p=0·0020; high density: aOR 3·4, 1·7–6·9,
