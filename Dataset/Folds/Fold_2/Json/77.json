Control Trials on Otago Exercise Program (OEP) to Reduce Falls Among Elderly Community Dwellers in Shahroud, Iran","abstract":"Background\nFall is a worldwide health problem among elderly people and a known leading cause of disabilities.\n\n Fall prevention programs have been implemented in various forms.\n\n The Otago exercise program (OEP) is one of the most recent home-base exercise training program.\n\n\nObjectives\nThis study was conducted to examine the effectiveness of OEP to reduce falls among elderly people in Shahroud, IR Iran.\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\nThis randomised control trial was conducted among the elderly community dwellers in Shahroud city of the Semnan province, IR Iran, with experience of falls in the last 12 months.\n\n Subjects of the study (n = 317) were recruited from elderly senior citizens at public health centers.\n\n Block systematic random sampling was applied to categorize the subjects in experimental and control groups.\n\n The experimental group (n = 160) received OEP for six months and was compared with the control group (n = 157) who received general health training.\n\n This study was registered with the following ID, IRCT2014012016285N1.\nResults\nThe findings of the study showed that OEP improved physical performance (Berg-Balance-Score with P &gt; 0.025, and Timed-Up-Go-Test with P &gt; 0.017) and functional capacity (Arm-Curl-Test with P &gt; 0.00 and Chair-Stand-Test with P &gt; 0.01).\n\n In addition, OEP significantly reduced the incidence of falls (P ? 0.00) among senior citizens in the experimental group.\n\n\nDiscussion\nThe OEP as a home-based exercise is effective for the reduction of the incidence of falls among senior citizens with a history of falls.\n\n The OEP can be recommended for elderly homebound people who do not have access to facilities.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4948256","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"Kowsar","authors":[{"firstname":"Ali","surname":"Dadgari","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"

Pilot Study","abstract":"Loss of muscle mass and strength are seemingly accepted as part of the ageing process, despite ultimately leading to the loss of independence.\n Resistance exercise is considered to be primary defence against loss of muscle function in older age, but it typically requires access to exercise equipment often in a gym environment.\n This pilot study aimed at examining the effect of a 28-day, unsupervised home-based exercise intervention on indices of leg strength and muscle size in healthy older adults.\n Twenty participants were randomly assigned to either maintain their habitual physical activity levels (Control; n=10; age, 74 (5) years; body mass, 26.3 (3.5)?kg/m2) or undertake “exercise snacks” twice daily (ES; n=10; age, 70 (4) years; body mass, 25.0 (3.4)?kg/m2).\n Both groups consumed 150?g of yogurt at their breakfast meal for the duration of the intervention.\n Sixty-second sit-to-stand score improved by 31% in ES, with no change in Control (p &lt; 0.01).\n Large effect sizes were observed for the difference in change scores between the groups for interpolated maximum leg pressing power (6% increase in ES) and thigh muscle cross-sectional area (2% increase in ES).\n The present pilot data suggest that exercise snacking might be a promising strategy to improve leg muscle function and size in older adults and that further investigation into zero-cost exercise strategies that allow high frequency of training is warranted.\n","id":"PMC6794984","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"Hindawi","authors":[{"firstname":"Oliver

to investigate the effects of a three-month group-based versus home-based exercise program on muscular, functional/physical performance and quality of life (QoL) across elderly with sarcopenia.\n 54 elderly (47 women, 7 men aged 72.87 ± 7 years) were randomly assigned to one of three interventions: supervised group (n = 18), individualized home-based exercise (n = 18) and control group (n =

dynamometers.\n Functional assessments included four-meter (4 m), ?imed-Up and Go (TUG) and chair stand (CS) tests.\n QoL was assessed with Greek Sarcopenia Quality of Life (SarQol_GR) questionnaire.\n Outcomes were assessed at baseline, immediately post-intervention (week 12), and 3 months post-intervention (week 24).\n Significant group x time interactions (p &lt; 0.001) were observed in QoL, calf circumference, TUG, CS, and 4 m tests, grip and knee muscle strength.\n Group-based compared to home-based exercise yielded significant improvements (p &lt; 0.05) in muscle mass
