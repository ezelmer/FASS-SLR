US-based descriptions of SARS-CoV-2 infections have, for the most part, focused on patient populations with severe disease, captured in areas with limited testing capacity. The objective of this study is to compare characteristics of positive and negative SARS-CoV-2 patients, in a population primarily comprised of mild and moderate infections, identified from comprehensive population-level testing. Here, we extracted demographics, comorbidities, and vital signs from 20,088 patients who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 at University of Utah Health clinics, in Salt Lake County, Utah; and for a subset of tested patients, we performed manual chart review to examine symptoms and exposure risks. To determine risk factors for testing positive, we used logistic regression to calculate the odds of testing positive, adjusting for symptoms and prior exposure. Of the 20,088 individuals, 1,229 (6.1%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. We found that Non-White persons were more likely to test positive compared to non-Hispanic Whites (adjOR=1.1, 95% CI: 0.8, 1.6), and that this increased risk is more pronounced among Hispanic or Latino persons (adjOR=2.0, 95%CI: 1.3, 3.1). However, we did not find differences in the duration of symptoms nor type of symptom presentation between non-Hispanic White and non-White individuals. We found that risk of hospitalization increases with age (adjOR=6.9 95% CI: 2.1, 22.5 for age 60+ compared to 0-19), and additionally show that younger individuals (aged 019), were underrepresented both in overall rates of testing as well as rates of testing positive. We did not find major race/ethnic differences in hospitalization rates. In this analysis of predominantly non-hospitalized individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2, enabled by expansive testing capacity, we found disparities in both testing and SARS-CoV-2 infection status by race/ethnicity and by age. Further work on addressing racial and ethnic disparities, particularly among Hispanic/Latino communities (where SARS-CoV-2 may be spreading more rapidly due to increased exposure and comparatively reduced testing), will be needed to effectively combat COVID-19 in the US.

Reasons for this disparity have not been well-characterized but may be due to underlying comorbidities or sociodemographic factors.\n\nObjectiveTo systematically determine patient characteristics associated with racial/ethnic disparities in COVID-19 outcomes.\n\nDesignA retrospective cohort study with comparative control groups.\n\nSettingPatients tested for COVID-19 at University of Michigan Medicine from March 10, 2020 to April 22, 2020.\n\nParticipants5,698 tested patients and two sets of comparison groups who were not tested for COVID-19: randomly selected unmatched controls (n = 7,211) and frequency-matched controls by race, age, and sex (n = 13,351).\n\nMain Outcomes and MeasuresWe identified factors associated with testing and testing positive for COVID-19, being hospitalized, requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mortality (in/out-patient during the time frame). Factors included race/ethnicity, age, smoking, alcohol consumption, healthcare utilization, and residential-level socioeconomic characteristics (SES; i.e., education, unemployment, population density, and poverty rate). Medical comorbidities were defined from the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes, and were aggregated into a comorbidity score.\n\nResultsOf 5,698 patients, (median age, 47 years; 38% male; mean BMI, 30.1), the majority were non-Hispanic Whites (NHW, 59.2%) and non-Hispanic Black/African-Americans (NHAA, 17.2%). Among 1,119 diagnosed, there were 41.2% NHW and 37.4% NHAA; 44.8% hospitalized, 20.6% admitted to ICU, and 3.8% died. Adjusting for age, sex, and SES, NHAA were 1.66 times more likely to be hospitalized (95% CI, 1.09-2.52; P=.02), 1.52 times more likely to enter ICU (95% CI, 0.92-2.52; P=.10). In addition to older age, male sex and obesity, high population density neighborhood (OR, 1.27 associated with one SD change [95% CI, 1.20-1.76]; P=.02) was associated with hospitalization. Pre-existing kidney disease led to 2.55 times higher risk of hospitalization (95% CI, 1.62-4.02; P<.001) in the overall population and 11.9 times higher mortality risk in NHAA (95% CI, 2.2-64.7, P=.004).\n\nConclusions and RelevancePre-existing type II diabetes/kidney diseases and living in high population density areas were associated with high risk for COVID-19 susceptibility and poor prognosis. Association of risk factors with COVID-19 outcomes differed by race. NHAA patients were disproportionately affected by obesity and kidney disease.\n\nKey PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat are the sociodemographic and pre-existing health conditions associated with COVID-19 outcomes and how do they differ by race/ethnicity?\n\nFindingsIn this retrospective cohort of 5,698 patients tested for COVID-19, high population density and comorbidities such as type II diabetes/kidney disease were associated with hospitalization, in addition to older age, male sex and obesity. Adjusting for covariates, non-Hispanic Blacks were 1.66 times more likely to be hospitalized and 1.52 times more likely to be admitted to ICUs than non-Hispanic Whites.\n\nMeaningTargeted interventions to support vulnerable populations are needed. Racial disparities existed in COVID-19 outcomes that cannot be explained after controlling for age, sex, and socioeconomic status.

Follow-up till discharge or death was complete for 99.3% of the cohort.\n\nResultsThe majority of the cohort was male (59.6%). Men were younger (median 64 vs. 70, p<0.001) and less likely to have comorbidities such as hypertension (32.5% vs. 39.9%, p<0.001), diabetes (22.6% vs. 26%, p=0.03), and obesity (6.9% vs. 9.8%, p=0.004) compared to women. Women had lower median values of laboratory markers associated with inflammation compared to men: white blood cells (5.95 vs. 6.8 K/uL, p<0.001), procalcitonin (0.14 vs 0.21 ng/mL, p<0.001), lactate dehydrogenase (375 vs. 428 U/L, p<0.001), C-reactive protein (87.7 vs. 123.2 mg/L, p<0.001). Unadjusted mortality was similar between men and women (28.8% vs. 28.5%, p=0.84), but more men required intensive care than women (25.2% vs. 19%, p<0.001). Male sex was an independent risk factor for mortality (OR 1.26, 95% 1.04-1.51) after adjustment for demographics, comorbidities, and baseline hypoxia. There were significant interactions between sex and coronary artery disease (p=0.038), obesity (p=0.01), baseline hypoxia (p<0.001), ferritin (p=0.002), lactate dehydrogenase (p=0.003), and procalcitonin (p=0.03). Except for procalcitonin, which had the opposite association, each of these factors was associated with disproportionately higher mortality among women.\n\nConclusionsMale sex was an independent predictor of mortality, consistent with prior studies. Notably, there were significant sex-specific interactions which indicated a disproportionate increase in mortality among women with coronary artery disease, obesity, and hypoxia. These new findings highlight patient subgroups for further study and help explain the recognized sex differences in COVID-19 outcomes.

Compared with non-Hispanic white participants, the risk for a positive Covid-19 test was increased across racial minorities (aORs ranging from 1.24 to 3.51). After adjustment for socioeconomic indices and Covid-19 exposure risk factors, the associations (aOR [95% CI]) were attenuated but remained significant for Hispanic (1.58 [1.24-2.02]) and Black participants (2.56 [1.93-3.39]) in the U.S. and South Asian (1.52 [1.38-1.67]) and Middle Eastern participants (1.56 [1.25-1.95]) in the U.K. A higher risk of Covid-19 and seeking or receiving treatment was also observed for several racial/ethnic minority subgroups.\n\nConclusionsOur results demonstrate an increase in Covid-19 risk among racial and ethnic minorities not completely explained by other risk factors for Covid-19, comorbidities, and sociodemographic characteristics.

Limited data are available characterizing SARS-Cov-2 infection in the United States.\n\nObjectiveTo determine associations between demographic and clinical factors and testing positive for coronavirus 2019 (Covid-19+), and among Covid-19+ subsequent hospitalization and intensive care.\n\nDesign, Setting, and ParticipantsRetrospective cohort study including all patients tested for Covid-19 between February 8 and March 30, 2020, inclusive. We extracted electronic health record data from the national Veterans Affairs Healthcare System, the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States, on 2,026,227 patients born between 1945 and 1965 and active in care.\n\nExposuresDemographic data, comorbidities, medication history, substance use, vital signs, and laboratory measures. Laboratory tests were analyzed first individually and then grouped into a validated summary measure of physiologic injury (VACS Index).\n\nMain Outcomes and MeasuresWe evaluated which factors were associated with Covid-19+ among all who tested. Among Covid-19+ we identified factors associated with hospitalization or intensive care. We identified independent associations using multivariable and conditional multivariable logistic regression with multiple imputation of missing values.\n\nResultsAmong Veterans aged 54-75 years, 585/3,789 (15.4%) tested Covid-19+. In adjusted analysis (C-statistic=0.806) black race was associated with Covid-19+ (OR 4.68, 95% CI 3.79-5.78) and the association remained in analyses conditional on site (OR 2.56, 95% CI 1.89-3.46).\n\nIn adjusted models, laboratory abnormalities (especially fibrosis-4 score [FIB-4] >3.25 OR 8.73, 95% CI 4.11-18.56), and VACS Index (per 5-point increase OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.43-1.84) were strongly associated with hospitalization. Associations were similar for intensive care. Although significant in unadjusted analyses, associations with comorbid conditions and medications were substantially reduced and, in most cases, no longer significant after adjustment.\n\nConclusions and RelevanceBlack race was strongly associated with Covid-19+, but not with hospitalization or intensive care. Among Covid-19+, risk of hospitalization and intensive care may be better characterized by laboratory measures and vital signs than by comorbid conditions or prior medication exposure.\n\nKey PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat are the demographic and clinical characteristics associated with testing positive for coronavirus 2019 (Covid-19+), and among Covid-19+ subsequent hospitalization and intensive care among Veterans in the United States?\n\nFindingsIn this retrospective cohort study of 2,026,227 Veterans aged 54-75 years and active in care, 585/3,789 (15.4%) tested Covid-19+. Black race was strongly associated with Covid-19+, but not with hospitalization or intensive care. Among Covid-19+, laboratory abnormalities and a summary measure of physiologic injury were strongly associated with hospitalization and intensive care.\n\nMeaningRacial differences in testing positive for Covid-19 may be an underestimate of the general population as racial health disparities in the Veterans Affairs Healthcare System tend to be smaller than in the private sector. Risk of hospitalization and intensive care may be better characterized by laboratory measures and vital signs than by comorbid conditions or prior medication exposure.

various comorbidities as well as racial disparity.\n\n However, the specific characteristics of these at-risk populations are still not known and approaches to lower mortality are lacking.\n\n\nMethods\nWe conducted a retrospective electronic health record data analysis of 25,326 subjects tested for COVID-19 between 2/25/20 and 6/22/20 at the University of Alabama at Birmingham Hospital, a tertiary health care center in the racially diverse Southern U.\n\nS.\n\n The primary outcome was mortality in COVID-19-positive subjects and the association with subject characteristics

Sociodemographic and geospatial data as well as, clinical management, respiratory failure, and patient mortality were obtained via the real-time registry.\n\n Data on COVID-19 specific care was extracted by retrospective chart review.\n\n\nResults\nCOVID-19 testing was performed on 900 symptomatic patients, comprising 3.4% of the Yale Heart Failure Registry (N = 26,703).\n\n Overall, 206 (23%) were COVID- 19+.\n\n As compared to COVID-19-, these patients were more likely to be older, black, have hypertension, coronary artery disease, and were less likely to be on renin angiotensin blockers (P&lt;0.05, all).\n\n COVID-19- patients tended to be more diffusely spread across the state whereas COVID-19+ were largely clustered around urban centers.\n\n 20% of COVID-19+ patients died, and age was associated with increased risk of death [OR 1.92 95% CI (1.33–2.78); P&lt;0.001].\n\n Among COVID-19+ patients who were ?85 years of age rates of hospitalization were 87%, rates of death 36%, and continuing hospitalization 62% at time of manuscript preparation.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn this real-world snapshot of COVID-19 infection among a large cohort of heart failure patients, we found that a small proportion had undergone testing.\n\n Patients found to be COVID-19+ tended to be black with multiple comorbidities and clustered around lower socioeconomic status communities.\n\n Elderly COVID-19+ patients were very likely to be admitted to the hospital and experience high rates of mortality.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7526909","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"César","surname":"Caraballo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Megan","surname":"McCullough","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Megan","surname":"McCullough","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Michael A.","surname":"Fuery","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fouad","surname":"Chouairi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fouad","surname":"Chouairi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Craig","surname":"Keating","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Neal G.","surname":"Ravindra","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"P.
