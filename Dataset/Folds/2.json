A global report of the monthly activity of these viruses is needed to inform public health strategies and programmes for their control.\n \nMethods\nIn this systematic analysis, we compiled data from a systematic literature review of studies published between Jan 1, 2000, and Dec 31, 2017; online datasets; and unpublished research data. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they reported laboratory-confirmed incidence data of human infection of influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, or metapneumovirus, or a combination of these, for at least 12 consecutive months (or 52 weeks equivalent); stable testing practice throughout all years reported; virus results among residents in well-defined geographical locations; and aggregated virus results at least on a monthly basis. Data were extracted through a three-stage process, from which we calculated monthly annual average percentage (AAP) as the relative strength of virus activity. We defined duration of epidemics as the minimum number of months to account for 75% of annual positive samples, with each component month defined as an epidemic month. Furthermore, we modelled monthly AAP of influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus using site-specific temperature and relative humidity for the prediction of local average epidemic months. We also predicted global epidemic months of influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus on a 5° by 5° grid. The systematic review in this study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42018091628.\n \nFindings\nWe initally identified 37?335 eligible studies. Of 21?065 studies remaining after exclusion of duplicates, 1081 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility, of which 185 were identified as eligible. We included 246 sites for influenza virus, 183 sites for respiratory syncytial virus, 83 sites for parainfluenza virus, and 65 sites for metapneumovirus. Influenza virus had clear seasonal epidemics in winter months in most temperate sites but timing of epidemics was more variable and less seasonal with decreasing distance from the equator. Unlike influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus had clear seasonal epidemics in both temperate and tropical regions, starting in late summer months in the tropics of each hemisphere, reaching most temperate sites in winter months. In most temperate sites, influenza virus epidemics occurred later than respiratory syncytial virus (by 0·3 months [95% CI ?0·3 to 0·9]) while no clear temporal order was observed in the tropics. Parainfluenza virus epidemics were found mostly in spring and early summer months in each hemisphere. Metapneumovirus epidemics occurred in late winter and spring in most temperate sites but the timing of epidemics was more diverse in the tropics. Influenza virus epidemics had shorter duration (3·8 months [3·6 to 4·0]) in temperate sites and longer duration (5·2 months [4·9 to 5·5]) in the tropics. Duration of epidemics was similar across all sites for respiratory syncytial virus (4·6 months [4·3 to 4·8]), as it was for metapneumovirus (4·8 months [4·4 to 5·1]). By comparison, parainfluenza virus had longer duration of epidemics (6·3 months [6·0 to 6·7]). Our model had good predictability in the average epidemic months of influenza virus in temperate regions and respiratory syncytial virus in both temperate and tropical regions. Through leave-one-out cross validation, the overall prediction error in the onset of epidemics was within 1 month (influenza virus ?0·2 months [?0·6 to 0·1]; respiratory syncytial virus 0·1 months [?0·2 to 0·4]).\n \nInterpretation\nThis study is the first to provide global representations of month-by-month activity of influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, and metapneumovirus. Our model is helpful in predicting the local onset month of influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus epidemics. The seasonality information has important implications for health services planning, the timing of respiratory syncytial virus passive prophylaxis, and the strategy of influenza virus and future respiratory syncytial virus vaccination.\n \nFunding\nEuropean Union Innovative Medicines Initiative Respiratory Syncytial Virus Consortium in Europe (RESCEU).\n

unclear.\n\n This study investigated 14 respiratory viruses in ARIs among children and associated meteorological factors in Shantou, southern China.\n\n\nMethods\nPaired nasal/throat-flocked swabs collected from 1,074 children with ARIs, who visited outpatient walk-in clinics in a tertiary hospital between December 2010 and November 2011, were examined for fourteen respiratory viruses - influenza viruses (FluA, FluB), respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV A and B), human coronaviruses (hCoV: 229E, OC43, HKU1, NL63), human metapneumoviruses (hMPV A and B), parainfluenza viruses (PIV1-4), human rhinoviruses (HRV A, B, C), enteroviruses (EV), adenoviruses (ADV), human bocavirus (hBoV), and human parechoviruses (hPeV) - by multiplex real-time PCR.\n\n\nResults\nWe identified at least one virus in 82.3% (884/1,074) and multiple viruses in 38.6% (415/1,074) of patients.\n\n EV and HRV were the most frequently detected single viruses (42.3%, 374/884 and 39.9%, 353/884 respectively) and co-detected pair (23.1%, 96/415).\n\n Overlapping seasonal trends of viruses were recorded over the year, with dual peaks for EV and single peaks for the others.\n\n By logistic regression analysis, EV was positively associated with the average temperature and humidity, hCoV, and PIV4, but negatively with HRV, PIV3, and hBoV.\n\n HRV was inversely associated with EV and PIV3.\nConclusions\nThis study reports high viral detection and co-detection rates in pediatric ARI cases mainly due to EV and HRV.\n\n Many viruses circulated throughout the year with similar seasonal trends in association with temperature, humidity, and wind velocity.\n\n Statistically significant associations were present among the viruses.\n\n Understanding the polyviral etiology and viral interactions in the cases

spectrum of disease and the epidemiology of CoV-HKU1 infections in relation to infections with other respiratory viruses are unknown.\n In this 12-month prospective study, 4,181 nasopharyngeal aspirates from patients with acute respiratory tract infections were subjected to reverse transcription-PCRs specific for CoV-HKU1 and human coronaviruses NL63 (HCoV-NL63), OC43 (HCoV-OC43), and 229E (HCoV-229E).\n Coronaviruses were detected in 87 (2.1%) patients, with 13 (0.3%) positive for CoV-HKU1, 17 (0.4%) positive for HCoV-NL63, 53 (1.3%) positive for HCoV-OC43, and 4 (0.1%) positive for HCoV-229E.\n Of the 13 patients with CoV-HKU1 infections, 11 were children and 8 had underlying diseases.\n Similar to the case for other coronaviruses, upper respiratory infection was the most common presentation of CoV-HKU1 infections, although pneumonia, acute bronchiolitis, and asthmatic exacerbation also occurred.\n Despite a shorter duration of fever (mean, 1.7 days) and no difference in maximum temperature in children with CoV-HKU1 infections compared to patients with most other respiratory virus infections, a high incidence of febrile seizures (50%) was noted, which was significantly higher than those for HCoV-OC43 (14%), adenovirus (9%), human parainfluenza virus 1 (0%), and respiratory syncytial virus (8%) infections.\n CoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 infections peaked in winter, although cases of the former also occurred in spring to early summer.\n This is in contrast to HCoV-NL63 infections, which mainly occurred in early summer and autumn but were absent in winter.\n Two genotypes of CoV-HKU1 cocirculated during the study period.\n Continuous studies over a longer period are warranted to ascertain the seasonal variation and relative importance of the different coronaviruses.\n Similar studies in other countries are required to better determine the epidemiology and genetic diversity of CoV-HKU1.","id":"10.1128/JCM.02614-05","idformat":"CROSSREF","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"PUBLISHER: American Society for Microbiology","authors":[{"firstname":"Susanna K.

Variation in transmission and migration rates can result in substantial variation in prevalence between regions.\n While the uncertainty in parameters is large, the scenarios we explore show that transient reductions in the incidence rate might be due to a combination of seasonal variation and infection control efforts but do not necessarily mean the epidemic is contained.\n Seasonal forcing on SARS-CoV-2 should thus be taken into account in the further monitoring of the global transmission.\n The likely aggregated effect of seasonal variation, infection control measures, and transmission rate variation is a prolonged pandemic wave with lower prevalence at any given time, thereby providing a window of opportunity for better preparation of health care systems","id":"10.4414/smw.2020.20224","idformat":"CORE","foundapis":"_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Albert","surname":"Jan","email":"coreGivesNoEmail","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Druelle","surname":"Valentin","email":"coreGivesNoEmail","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Dyrdak","surname":"Robert","email":"coreGivesNoEmail","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hodcroft","surname":"Emma B.","email":"coreGivesNoEmail","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"                            Neher","surname":"Richard A.","email":"coreGivesNoEmail","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1186/s40064-016-3101-9","date":"2016-08-18","title":"Molecular epidemiology and characterization of human coronavirus in Thailand, 2012–2013","abstract":"Background\nCoronavirus causes respiratory infections in humans.\n\n To determine the prevalence of human coronavirus (HCoV) infection among patients with influenza-like illness, 5833 clinical samples from nasopharyngeal swabs and aspirates collected between January 2012 and December 2013 were examined.\n\n\nResults\nHCoV was found in 46 (0.79 %) samples.\n\n There were 19 (0.32 %) HCoV-HKU1, 19 (0.32 %) HCoV-NL63, 5 (0.09 %) HCoV-229E, and 3 (0.05 %) HCoV-OC43.

tested for RSV by PCR for all illness episodes.\n\n Birth outcomes were assessed at a postpartum home visit.\n\n\nResults\n311 (9%) of 3509 infants had an RSV ARI.\n\n RSV ARI incidence decreased from 551/1000 person-years in infants born between 28 and 31 weeks to 195/1000 person-years in infants born full-term (p = 0.017).\n\n Of 220 infants (71%) evaluated in the health system, 41 (19%) visited a hospital or physician.\n\n Of 287 infants with an assessment performed, 203 (71%) had a lower respiratory tract infection.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn a rural south Asian setting with intensive home-based surveillance, RSV caused a significant burden of respiratory illness.\n\n Preterm infants had the highest incidence of RSV ARI, and should be considered a priority group for RSV preventive interventions in resource-limited settings.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4942356","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_elsevier_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Helen
