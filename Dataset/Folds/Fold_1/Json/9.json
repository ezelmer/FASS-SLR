","abstract":"BackgroundCovid-19 disease causes significant morbidity and mortality through increase inflammation and thrombosis. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis are states of chronic inflammation and indicate advanced metabolic disease. We sought to understand the risk of hospitalization for Covid-19 associated with NAFLD/NASH.\n\nMethodsRetrospective analysis of electronic medical record data of 6,700 adults with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR from March 1, 2020 to Aug 25, 2020. Logistic regression and competing risk were used to assess odds of being hospitalized. Additional adjustment was added to assess risk of hospitalization among patients with a prescription for metformin use within the 3 months prior to the SARS-CoV-2 PCR result, history of home glucagon-like-peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) use, and history of metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS). Interactions were assessed by gender and race.\n\nResultsA history of NAFLD/NASH was associated with increased odds of admission for Covid-19: logistic regression OR 2.04 (1.55, 2.96, p<0.01), competing risks OR 1.43 (1.09-1.88, p<0.01); and each additional year of having NAFLD/NASH was associated with a significant increased risk of being hospitalized for Covid-19, OR 1.86 (1.43-2.42, p<0.01). After controlling for NAFLD/NASH, persons with obesity had decreased odds of hospitalization for Covid-19, OR 0.41 (0.34-0.49, p<0.01). NAFLD/NASH increased risk of hospitalization in men and women, and in all racial/ethnic subgroups. Mediation treatments for metabolic syndrome were associated with non-significant reduced risk of admission: OR 0.42 (0.18-1.01, p=0.05) for home metformin use and OR 0.40 (0.14-1.17, p=0.10) for home GLP-1RA use. MBS was associated with a significant decreased risk of admission: OR 0.22 (0.05-0.98, p<0.05).\n\nConclusionsNAFLD/NASH is a significant risk factor for hospitalization for Covid-19, and appears to account for risk attributed to obesity. Treatments for metabolic disease mitigated risks from NAFLD/NASH. More research is needed to confirm risk associated with visceral adiposity, and patients should be screened for and informed of treatments for metabolic syndrome.\n\nKey QuestionsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSDoes NAFLD/NASH independently increase risk for poor outcomes from Covid-19?\n\nFindingsIn this observational study, a history of NAFLD/NASH was associated with a significantly increased odds of hospitalization. Metabolic surgery was protective against admission in persons with NAFLD/NASH and Covid-19. Metformin and glucagon like peptide 1 receptor agonists were associated with non-significant protecting against admission.\n\nMeaningTreatment for metabolic syndrome greatly reduce the elevated risk of hospitalization for Covid-19 among persons with NAFLD/NASH.

attention.\n\n While diabetes is known to aggravate COVID?19 severity, it is not known whether nondiabetic patients with metabolic dysfunction are also more prone to more severe disease.\n\n The association of metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) with COVID?19 severity in nondiabetic patients was investigated here.\n\n\nMethods\nThe study cohort comprised 65 patients with (i.\n\ne.\n\n cases) and 65 patients without MAFLD (i.\n\ne.\n\n controls).\n\n Each case was randomly matched with one control by sex (1:1) and age (±5 years).\n\n The association between the presence of MAFLD (as exposure) and COVID?19 severity (as the outcome) was assessed by binary logistic regression analysis.\n\n\nResults\nIn nondiabetic patients with COVID?19, the presence of MAFLD was associated with a four?fold increased risk of severe COVID?19; the risk increased with increasing numbers of metabolic risk factors.\n\n The association with COVID?19 severity persisted after adjusting for age, sex, and coexisting morbid conditions.\n\n\nConclusion\nHealth?care professionals caring for nondiabetic patients with COVID?19 should be cognizant of the increased likelihood of severe COVID?19 in patients with MAFLD.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7280625","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Feng","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kenneth
