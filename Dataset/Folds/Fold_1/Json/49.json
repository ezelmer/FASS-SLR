While increase of HLA-B* 4601 allele frequency was observed in the 'Probable SARS infected' patient group, a further significant increase of the allele was seen in the 'Severe cases' patient group.\n\n These results appeared to indicate association of HLA-B* 4601 with the severity of SARS infection in Asian populations.\n\n Independent studies are needed to test these

may influence the susceptibility to SARS-coronavirus infection and disease outcomes.\n\n A recent study has suggested that the deletion allele (D allele) of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)

previous study.\n\n Thus, we have investigated the association between ACE insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism and the progression to ARDS or requirement of intensive care in SARS patients.\n\n\nMethod\nOne hundred and forty genetically unrelated Chinese SARS patients and 326 healthy volunteers were recruited.\n\n The ACE I/D genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction and agarose gel electrophoresis.\n\n\nResults\nThere is no significant difference in the genotypic distributions and the allelic frequencies of the ACE I/D polymorphism between the SARS patients and the healthy control subjects.\n\n Moreover, there is also no evidence that ACE I/D polymorphism is associated with the progression to ARDS or the requirement of intensive care in the SARS patients.\n\n In multivariate logistic analysis, age is the only factor associated with the development of ARDS while age and male sex are independent factors associated with the requirement of intensive care.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe ACE I/D polymorphism is not directly related to increased susceptibility to SARS-coronavirus infection and is not associated with poor outcomes after SARS-coronavirus infection.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1090578","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"KC
