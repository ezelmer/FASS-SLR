recovered coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients post discharge (re-detectable positive, RP) remained elusive.\n\n\nMethods\nA total of 262 COVID-19 patients discharged from January 23 to February 25, 2020 were enrolled into this study.\n\n RP and non-RP (NRP) patients were grouped according to disease severity, and the characterization at re-admission was analyzed.\n\n SARS-CoV-2 RNA and plasma antibody levels were measured, and all patients were followed up for at least 14 days, with a cutoff date of March 10, 2020.\nResults\nA total of 14.5% of RP patients were detected.\n\n These patients were characterized as young and displayed mild and moderate conditions compared to NRP patients while no severe patients were RP.\n\n RP patients displayed fewer symptoms but similar plasma antibody levels during their hospitalization compared to NRP patients.\n\n Upon hospital readmission, these patients showed no obvious symptoms or disease progression.\n\n All 21 close contacts of RP patients were tested negative for viral RNA and showed no suspicious symptoms.\n\n Eighteen out of 24 of RNA-negative samples detected by the commercial kit were tested positive for viral RNA using a hyper-sensitive method, suggesting that these patients were potential carriers of the virus after recovery from COVID-19.\nConclusions\nOur results indicated that young patients, with a mild diagnosis of COVID-19 are more likely to display RP status after discharge.\n\n These patients show no obvious symptoms or disease progression upon re-admission.\n\n More sensitive RNA detection methods are required to monitor these patients.\n\n Our findings provide information and evidence for the management of convalescent COVID-19 patients.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7575971","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"AME Publishing

patients (n = 54) and normal individuals (n = 74) using a 1H NMR?based metabolomics approach and developed an integrated method of least?squares support vector machine (LS?SVM) and serum metabolic biomarkers to assist COPD diagnosis.\n\n\nResults\nWe observed a hypometabolic state in serum of COPD patients, as indicated by decreases in N?acetyl?glycoprotein (NAG), lipoprotein (LOP, mainly

clearance of viral RNA from different specimens of patients with 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) remain unclear.\n\n This study analyzed the clearance time and factors influencing 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) RNA in different samples from patients with COVID-19, providing further evidence to improve the management of patients during convalescence.\n\n\nMethods:\nThe clinical data and laboratory test results of convalescent patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to from January 20, 2020 to February 10, 2020 were collected retrospectively.\n\n The reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results for patients’ oropharyngeal swab, stool, urine, and serum samples were collected and analyzed.\n\n Convalescent patients refer to recovered non-febrile patients without respiratory symptoms who had two successive (minimum 24 h sampling interval) negative RT-PCR results for viral RNA from oropharyngeal swabs.\n\n The effects of cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4)+ T lymphocytes, inflammatory indicators, and glucocorticoid treatment on viral nucleic acid clearance were analyzed.\n\n\nResults:\nIn the 292 confirmed cases, 66 patients recovered after treatment and were included in our study.\n\n In total, 28 (42.4%) women and 38 men (57.6%) with a median age of 44.0 (34.0–62.0) years were analyzed.\n\n After in-hospital treatment, patients’ inflammatory indicators decreased with improved clinical condition.\n\n The median time from the onset of symptoms to first negative RT-PCR results for oropharyngeal swabs in convalescent patients was 9.5 (6.0–11.0) days.\n\n By February 10, 2020, 11 convalescent patients (16.7%) still tested positive for viral RNA from stool specimens and the other 55 patients’ stool specimens were negative for 2019-nCoV following a median duration of 11.0 (9.0–16.0) days after symptom onset.\n\n Among these 55 patients, 43 had a longer duration until stool specimens were negative for viral RNA than for throat swabs, with a median delay of 2.0 (1.0–4.0) days.\n\n Results for only four (6.9%) urine samples were positive for viral nucleic acid out of 58 cases; viral RNA was still present in three patients’ urine specimens after throat swabs were negative.\n\n Using a multiple linear regression model (F?=?2.669, P?=?0.044, and adjusted R2?=?0.122), the analysis showed that the CD4+ T lymphocyte count may help predict the duration of viral RNA detection in patients’ stools (t?=??2.699, P?=?0.010).\n\n The duration of viral RNA detection from oropharyngeal swabs and fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group (15 days vs.\n\n 8.0 days, respectively; t?=?2.550, P?=?0.013) and the duration of viral RNA detection in fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group (20 days vs.\n\n 11 days, respectively; t?=?4.631, P?&lt;?0.001).\n\n There was no statistically significant difference in inflammatory indicators between patients with positive fecal viral RNA test results and those with negative results (P?&gt;?0.05).\n\n\nConclusions:\nIn brief, as the clearance of viral RNA in patients’ stools was delayed compared to that in oropharyngeal swabs, it is important to identify viral RNA in feces during convalescence.\n\n Because of the delayed clearance of viral RNA in the glucocorticoid treatment group, glucocorticoids are not recommended in the treatment of COVID-19, especially for mild disease.\n\n The duration of RNA detection may relate to host cell immunity.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7147278","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"Wolters Kluwer

Of 50 environmental samples taken from cases’ apartments, 24% tested positive.\n\n Viral genome sequencing showed that the viruses identified from the squat toilet and shoe-bottom dirt inside the apartment of Cases 1-2 were homologous with those from Cases 3-8 and those identified from sewage samples.\n\n The sewage pipe leading from the apartment of Cases 1-2 to the drainage had a large hole above ground.\n\n Rainfalls after the onset of Cases 1-2 flooded the streets.\n\n\nConclusion\nOur investigation has for the first time pointed to the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 might spread by sewage.\n\n This finding highlighted the importance of sewage management, especially in densely-populated places with poor hygiene and sanitation measures, such as urban slums and other low-income communities in developing countries.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7665342","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"Oxford University Press","authors":[{"firstname":"Jun","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Zongqiu","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Chenghua","surname":"Gong","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Hui","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Baisheng","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Kuibiao","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Xi","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"5"},{"firstname":" Conghui","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Qinlong","surname":"Jing","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Guocong","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Pengzhe","surname":"Qin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Yufei","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Yi","surname":"Zhong","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Lijuan","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Bao-Ping","surname":"Zhu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Zhicong","surname":"Yang","email":"baopingzhu@yahoo.com","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1007/s11606-020-05822-1","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A Case Series of Recurrent Viral RNA Positivity in Recovered COVID-19 Chinese Patients","abstract":"","id":"PMC7169645","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"Springer International Publishing","authors":[{"firstname":"Kenneth I.","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Xiao-Bo","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Xiang-Hong","surname":"Jin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Wen-Yue","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Feng","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Yong-Ping","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Ming-Hua","surname":"Zheng","email":"zhengmh@wmu.edu.cn","contributions":"0"}]}]}
