Our patient, a sixty-seven-year-old Caucasian man, tested positive to coronavirus and presented oral manifestations such as recurrent herpes simplex, candidiasis, and geographic tongue.\n We support the argument that some oral conditions could be secondary to the deterioration of systemic health or due to treatments for COVID-19.

2019","abstract":"Objectives\nTo slow down the transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), it is important to identify specific symptoms for effective screening.\n\n While anosmia/hyposmia and dysgeusia/ageusia have been identified as highly prevalent symptoms, there are wide geographic variations, necessitating the regional evaluation of the prevalence of the symptoms.\n\n\nMethods\nA cross-sectional study was performed to evaluate the self-reported symptoms among adults (over 18 years old) who underwent COVID-19 tests at an ambulatory assessment centre.\n\n We identified 1,345 patients (102 positive and 1,243 negative) who visited the assessment centre between March 16 and April 15, 2020. We randomly sampled negative patients in a 1:3 ratio.\n\n The primary outcome was the prevalence of self-reported anosmia/hyposmia and dysgeusia/ageusia.\n\n Logistic regression was performed to evaluate the association between COVID-19 positivity and loss of smell and taste.\n\n\nResults\nFifty-six of 102 (50%) positive patients and 72 of 306 (23.5%) negative patients completed the survey.\n\n Anosmia/hyposmia and dysgeusia/ageusia were more prevalent among COVID-19 positive patients (41.1% v.\n\n 4.2%, p &lt; 0.001 for smell and 46.4% v.\n\n 5.6%, p &lt; 0.001 for taste).\n\n Anosmia/hyposmia and dysgeusia/ageusia were independently highly associated with COVID-19 positivity (adjusted odds ratios 14.4 and 11.4 for smell and taste, respectively).\n\n\nConclusion\nIn this Canadian study, smell and taste loss may be key symptoms of COVID-19.

results from a statewide experience","abstract":"Objective\nThere is a paucity of clinical data on critically ill patients with COVID?19 requiring extracorporeal life support.\n\n\nMethods\nA statewide multi?institutional collaborative for COVID?19 patients was utilized to obtain clinical data on the first 10 critically ill COVID?19 patients who required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).\n\n\nResults\nOf the first 10 patients that required ECMO for COVID?19, the age ranged from 31 to 62 years with the majority (70%) being men.\n\n Seven (70%) had comorbidities.\n\n The majority (80%) of patients had known sick contact and exposure to COVID?19 positive patients or traveled to pandemic areas inside the United States within the 2 weeks before symptom onset.\n\n None of the patients were healthcare workers.\n\n The most common symptoms leading to the presentation were high fever ?103°F (90%), cough (80%) and dyspnea (70%), followed by fatigue and gastrointestinal symptoms (both 30%), myalgia, loss of taste, pleuritic chest pain, and confusion (all 10%).\n\n All patients had bilateral infiltrates on chest X?rays suggestive of interstitial viral pneumonia.\n\n All patients were cannulated in the venovenous configuration.\n\n Two (20%) patients were successfully liberated from ECMO support after 7 and 10 days, respectively, and one (10%) patient is currently on a weaning course.\n\n One patient (10%) died after 9 days on ECMO from multiorgan dysfunction.\n\n\nConclusions\nThese preliminary multi?institutional data from a statewide collaborative offer insight into the clinical characteristics of the first 10 patients requiring ECMO for COVID?19 and their initial clinical course.\n\n Greater morbidity and mortality is likely to be seen in these critically ill patients with longer follow?up.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7267409","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"John Wiley and Sons

scarce medical resources.\n\n Identifying indicators of hospital admission for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID?19) patients early in the disease course could aid the efficient allocation of medical interventions.\n\n Self?reported olfactory impairment has recently been recognized as a hallmark of COVID?19 and may be an important predictor of clinical outcome.\n\n\nMethods\nA retrospective review of all patients presenting to a San Diego Hospital system with laboratory?confirmed positive COVID?19 infection was conducted with evaluation of olfactory and gustatory function and clinical disease course.\n\n Univariable and multivariable logistic regression were performed to identify risk factors for hospital admission and anosmia.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 169 patients tested positive for COVID?19 disease between March 3 and April 8, 2020. Olfactory and gustatory data were obtained for 128 (75.7%) of 169 subjects, of which 26 (20.1%) of 128 required hospitalization.\n\n Admission for COVID?19 was associated with intact sense of smell and taste, increased age, diabetes, and subjective and objective parameters associated with respiratory failure.\n\n On adjusted analysis, anosmia was strongly and independently associated with outpatient care (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.09; 95% CI, 0.01?0.74), whereas positive findings of pulmonary infiltrates and/or pleural effusion on chest radiograph (aOR 8.01; 95% CI, 1.12?57.49) was strongly and independently associated with admission.\n\n\nConclusion\nNormosmia is an independent predictor of admission in COVID?19 cases.\n\n Smell loss in COVID?19 may be associated with a milder clinical course.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7264572","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"John Wiley and Sons Inc.","authors":[{"firstname":"Carol H.","surname":"Yan","email":"c1yan@health.ucsd.edu","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":" Farhoud","surname":"Faraji","email":"NULL","contributions":"6"},{"firstname":" Farhoud","surname":"Faraji","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Divya P.","surname":"Prajapati","email":"NULL","contributions":"4"},{"firstname":" Benjamin T.","surname":"Ostrander","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Adam S.","surname":"DeConde","email":"NULL","contributions":"4"}]},{"doi":"10.1007/s15010-020-01442-3","date":"2020-05-07","title":"Contribution of anosmia and dysgeusia for diagnostic of COVID-19 in outpatients","abstract":"","id":"PMC7221233","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","authors":[{"firstname":"Souheil","surname":"Zayet","email":"souhail.zayet@gmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Timothee","surname":"Klopfenstein","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Julien","surname":"Mercier","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" N’dri Juliette","surname":"Kadiane-Oussou","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Ludovic","surname":"Lan Cheong Wah","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Pierre-Yves","surname":"Royer","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Lynda","surname":"Toko","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Vincent","surname":"Gendrin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]}]}
