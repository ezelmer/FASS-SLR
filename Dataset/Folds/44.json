the possible socioeconomic and ethnic health inequities is particularly important given the diverse population and fragile political and economic situation.\n\n We aimed to characterise the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil and assess variations in mortality according to region, ethnicity, comorbidities, and symptoms.\n\n\nMethods\nWe conducted a cross-sectional observational study of COVID-19 hospital mortality using data from the SIVEP-Gripe (Sistema de Informação de Vigilância Epidemiológica da Gripe) dataset to characterise the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil.\n\n In the study, we included hospitalised patients who had a positive RT-PCR test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and who had ethnicity information in the dataset.\n\n Ethnicity of participants was classified according to the five categories used by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics: Branco (White), Preto (Black), Amarelo (East Asian), Indígeno (Indigenous), or Pardo (mixed ethnicity).\n\n We assessed regional variations in patients with COVID-19 admitted to hospital by state and by two socioeconomically grouped regions (north and central-south).\n\n We used mixed-effects Cox regression survival analysis to estimate the effects of ethnicity and comorbidity at an individual level in the context of regional variation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 99?557 patients in the SIVEP-Gripe dataset, we included 11?321 patients in our study.\n\n 9278 (82·0%) of these patients were from the central-south region, and 2043 (18·0%) were from the north region.\n\n Compared with White Brazilians, Pardo and Black Brazilians with COVID-19 who were admitted to hospital had significantly higher risk of mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1·45, 95% CI 1·33–1·58 for Pardo Brazilians; 1·32, 1·15–1·52 for Black Brazilians).\n\n Pardo ethnicity was the second most important risk factor (after age) for death.\n\n Comorbidities were more common in Brazilians admitted to hospital in the north region than in the central-south, with similar proportions between the various ethnic groups.\n\n States in the north had higher HRs compared with those of the central-south, except for Rio de Janeiro, which had a much higher HR than that of the other central-south states.\n\n\nInterpretation\nWe found evidence of two distinct but associated effects: increased mortality in the north region (regional effect) and in the Pardo and Black populations (ethnicity effect).\n\n We speculate that the regional effect is driven by increasing comorbidity burden in regions with lower levels of socioeconomic development.\n\n The ethnicity effect might be related to differences in susceptibility to COVID-19 and access to health care (including intensive care) across ethnicities.\n\n Our analysis supports an urgent effort on the part of Brazilian authorities to consider how the national response to COVID-19 can better protect Pardo and Black Brazilians, as well as the population of poorer states, from their higher risk of dying of COVID-19.\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7332269","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_elsevier_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Pedro","surname":"Baqui","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ioana","surname":"Bica","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Valerio","surname":"Marra","email":"marra@cosmo-ufes.org","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ari","surname":"Ercole","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"

appropriate.\n\n\nResults\nOur study enrolled 109 COVID-19 patients who died during hospitalization and 116 recovered patients.\n\n The median age of the death group was older than the recovered group (69 [62, 74] vs.\n\n 40 [33, 57] years, Z?=?9.738, P?&lt;?0.001).\n\n More patients in the death group had underlying diseases (72.5% vs.\n\n 41.4%, ?2?=?22.105, P?&lt;?0.001).\n\n Patients in the death group had a significantly longer time of illness onset to hospitalization (10.0 [6.5, 12.0] vs.\n\n 7.0 [5.0, 10.0] days, Z?=?3.216, P?=?0.001).\n\n On admission, the proportions of patients with symptoms of dyspnea (70.6% vs.\n\n 19.0%, ?2?=?60.905, P?&lt;?0.001) and expectoration (32.1% vs.\n\n 12.1%, ?2?=?13.250, P?&lt;?0.001) were significantly higher in the death group.\n\n The blood oxygen saturation was significantly lower in the death group (85 [77, 91]% vs.\n\n 97 [95, 98]%, Z?=?10.625, P?&lt;?0.001).\n\n The white blood cell (WBC) in death group was significantly higher on admission (7.23 [4.87, 11.17] vs.\n\n 4.52 [3.62, 5.88] ×109/L, Z?=?7.618, P?&lt;?0.001).\n\n Patients in the death group exhibited significantly lower lymphocyte count (0.63 [0.40, 0.79] vs.\n\n 1.00 [0.72, 1.27] ×109/L, Z?=?8.037, P?&lt;?0.001) and lymphocyte percentage (7.10 [4.45, 12.73]% vs.\n\n 23.50 [15.27, 31.25]%, Z?=?10.315, P?&lt;?0.001) on admission, and the lymphocyte percentage continued to decrease during hospitalization (7.10 [4.45, 12.73]% vs.\n\n 2.91 [1.79, 6.13]%, Z?=?5.242, P?&lt;?0.001).\n\n Alanine transaminase (22.00 [15.00, 34.00] vs.\n\n 18.70 [13.00, 30.38] U/L, Z?=?2.592, P?=?0.010), aspartate transaminase (34.00 [27.00, 47.00] vs.\n\n 22.00 [17.65, 31.75] U/L, Z?=?7.308, P?&lt;?0.001), and creatinine levels (89.00 [72.00, 133.50] vs.\n\n 65.00 [54.60, 78.75] ?mol/L, Z?=?6.478, P?&lt;?0.001) were significantly higher in the death group than those in the recovered group.\n\n C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were also significantly higher in the death group on admission (109.25 [35.00, 170.28] vs.\n\n 3.22 [1.04, 21.80] mg/L, Z?=?10.206, P?&lt;?0.001) and showed no significant improvement after treatment (109.25 [35.00, 170.28] vs.\n\n 81.60 [27.23, 179.08] mg/L, Z?=?1.219, P?=?0.233).\n\n The patients in the death group had more complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (89.9% vs.\n\n 8.6%, ?2?=?148.105, P?&lt;?0.001), acute cardiac injury (59.6% vs.\n\n 0.9%, ?2?=?93.222, P?&lt;?0.001), acute kidney injury (18.3% vs.\n\n 0%, ?2?=?23.257, P?&lt;?0.001), shock (11.9% vs.\n\n 0%, ?2?=?14.618, P?&lt;?0.001), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) (6.4% vs.\n\n 0%, ?2?=?7.655, P?=?0.006).\n\n\nConclusions\nCompared to the recovered group, more patients in the death group exhibited characteristics of advanced age, pre-existing comorbidities, dyspnea, oxygen saturation decrease, increased WBC count, decreased lymphocytes, and elevated CRP levels.\n\n More patients in the death group had complications such as ARDS, acute cardiac injury, acute kidney injury, shock, and DIC.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7289311","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Yan","surname":"Deng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kui","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan-Yuan","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jin","surname":"Shang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ling","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ke","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fan","surname":"Leng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shuang","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui-Guo","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Pei-Fang","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"

risk and disease progression in 639 critically ill patients with COVID-19 in Europe: Initial report of the international RISC-19-ICU prospective observational cohort","abstract":"Background\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with a high disease burden with 10% of confirmed cases progressing towards critical illness.\n\n Nevertheless, the disease course and predictors of mortality in critically ill patients are poorly understood.\n\n\nMethods\nFollowing the critical developments in ICUs in regions experiencing early inception of the pandemic, the European-based, international RIsk Stratification in COVID-19 patients in the Intensive Care Unit (RISC-19-ICU) registry was created to provide near real-time assessment of patients developing critical illness due to COVID-19.\nFindings\nAs of April 22, 2020, 639 critically ill patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included in the RISC-19-ICU registry.\n\n Of these, 398 had deceased or been discharged from the ICU.\n\n ICU-mortality was 24%, median length of stay 12 (IQR, 5–21) days.\n\n ARDS was diagnosed in 74%, with a minimum P/F-ratio of 110 (IQR, 80–148).\n\n Prone positioning, ECCO2R, or ECMO were applied in 57%.\n\n Off-label therapies were prescribed in 265 (67%) patients, and 89% of all bloodstream infections were observed in this subgroup (n = 66; RR=3·2, 95% CI [1·7–6·0]).\n\n While PCT and IL-6 levels remained similar in ICU survivors and non-survivors throughout the ICU stay (p = 0·35, 0·34), CRP, creatinine, troponin, d-dimer, lactate, neutrophil count, P/F-ratio diverged within the first seven days (p&lt;0·01).\n\n On a multivariable Cox proportional-hazard regression model at admission, creatinine, d-dimer, lactate, potassium, P/F-ratio, alveolar-arterial gradient, and ischemic heart disease were independently associated with ICU-mortality.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe European RISC-19-ICU cohort demonstrates a moderate mortality of 24% in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Despite high ARDS severity, mechanical ventilation incidence was low and associated with more rescue therapies.\n\n In contrast to risk factors in hospitalized patients reported in other studies, the main mortality predictors in these critically ill patients were markers of oxygenation deficit, renal and microvascular dysfunction, and coagulatory activation.\n\n Elevated risk of bloodstream infections underscores the need to exercise caution with off-label therapies.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7338015","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_elsevier_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Pedro David","surname":"Wendel
