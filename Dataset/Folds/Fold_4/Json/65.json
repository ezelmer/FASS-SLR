Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing Municipal Science and Technology

COVID-19 are limited.\n\n\nObjective\nWe sought to evaluate the severity on admission, complications, treatment, and outcomes of patients with COVID-19.\nMethods\nPatients with COVID-19 admitted to Tongji Hospital from January 26, 2020, to February 5, 2020, were retrospectively enrolled and followed-up until March 3, 2020. Potential risk factors for severe COVID-19 were analyzed by a multivariable binary logistic model.\n\n Cox proportional hazard regression model was used for survival analysis in severe patients.\n\n\nResults\nWe identified 269 (49.1%) of 548 patients as severe cases on admission.\n\n Older age, underlying hypertension, high cytokine levels (IL-2R, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-?), and high lactate dehydrogenase level were significantly associated with severe COVID-19 on admission.\n\n The prevalence of asthma in patients with COVID-19 was 0.9%, markedly lower than that in the adult population of Wuhan.\n\n The estimated mortality was 1.1% in nonsevere patients and 32.5% in severe cases during the average 32 days of follow-up period.\n\n Survival analysis revealed that male sex, older age, leukocytosis, high lactate dehydrogenase level, cardiac injury, hyperglycemia, and high-dose corticosteroid use were associated with death in patients with severe COVID-19.\nConclusions\nPatients with older age, hypertension, and high lactate dehydrogenase level need careful observation and early intervention to prevent the potential development of severe COVID-19. Severe male patients with heart injury, hyperglycemia, and high-dose corticosteroid use may have a high risk of death.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7152876","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"American Academy of Allergy, Asthma &amp; Immunology","authors":[{"firstname":"Xiaochen","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Shuyun","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Muqing","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Ke","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Yu","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Ying","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Jing","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Min","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Bo","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Zhenyu","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Cong","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Junqing","surname":"Yue","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Zhiguo","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Harald","surname":"Renz","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Xiansheng","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Jungang","surname":"Xie","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Min","surname":"Xie","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Jianping","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1111/all.14238","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Unknown Title","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1164/rccm.202002-0445OC","date":"2020-04-10","title":"COVID-19 with Different Severities: A Multicenter Study of Clinical Features","abstract":"Rationale: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is now a global health concern.\n","id":"PMC7258639","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"American Thoracic Society","authors":[{"firstname":"Yun","surname":"Feng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Yun","surname":"Ling","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Yun","surname":"Ling","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Tao","surname":"Bai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Tao","surname":"Bai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Yusang","surname":"Xie","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Jie","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Jie","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Jian","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Weining","surname":"Xiong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Dexiang","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Rong","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Fangying","surname":"Lu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Yunfei","surname":"Lu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Xuhui","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Yuqing","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Yuqing","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Xin","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Yong","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Hanssa Dwarka","surname":"Summah","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Huihuang","surname":"Lin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Jiayang","surname":"Yan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Min","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Hongzhou","surname":"Lu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Hongzhou","surname":"Lu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Jieming","surname":"Qu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Jieming","surname":"Qu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.3346/jkms.2020.35.e142","date":"2020-03-27","title":"Clinical Course and Outcomes of Patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection: a Preliminary Report of the First 28 Patients from the Korean Cohort Study on COVID-19","abstract":"Background\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-infected pneumonia emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019.
