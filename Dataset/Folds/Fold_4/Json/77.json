Control Trials on Otago Exercise Program (OEP) to Reduce Falls Among Elderly Community Dwellers in Shahroud, Iran","abstract":"Background\nFall is a worldwide health problem among elderly people and a known leading cause of disabilities.\n\n Fall prevention programs have been implemented in various forms.\n\n The Otago exercise program (OEP) is one of the most recent home-base exercise training program.\n\n\nObjectives\nThis study was conducted to examine the effectiveness of OEP to reduce falls among elderly people in Shahroud, IR Iran.\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\nThis randomised control trial was conducted among the elderly community dwellers in Shahroud city of the Semnan province, IR Iran, with experience of falls in the last 12 months.\n\n Subjects of the study (n = 317) were recruited from elderly senior citizens at public health centers.\n\n Block systematic random sampling was applied to categorize the subjects in experimental and control groups.\n\n The experimental group (n = 160) received OEP for six months and was compared with the control group (n = 157) who received general health training.\n\n This study was registered with the following ID, IRCT2014012016285N1.\nResults\nThe findings of the study showed that OEP improved physical performance (Berg-Balance-Score with P &gt; 0.025, and Timed-Up-Go-Test with P &gt; 0.017) and functional capacity (Arm-Curl-Test with P &gt; 0.00 and Chair-Stand-Test with P &gt; 0.01).\n\n In addition, OEP significantly reduced the incidence of falls (P ? 0.00) among senior citizens in the experimental group.\n\n\nDiscussion\nThe OEP as a home-based exercise is effective for the reduction of the incidence of falls among senior citizens with a history of falls.\n\n The OEP can be recommended for elderly homebound people who do not have access to facilities.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4948256","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ali","surname":"Dadgari","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tengku","surname":"Aizan

preliminary impact on physical activity and function","abstract":"\nAims\nThe purpose of this study is to investigate whether an in-home, individually tailored intervention is efficacious in promoting increases in physical activity (PA) and improvements in physical functioning (PF) in low-active older adults.\n\nMethods\nParticipants were randomized to two groups for the 8-week intervention.\n The enhanced physical activity (EPA) group received individualized exercise programming, including personalized step goals and a resistance band training program, and the standard of care (SoC) group received a general activity goal.\n Pre- and post-intervention PF measures included choice step reaction time, knee extension/flexion strength, hand grip strength, and 8 ft up and go test completion time.\n\nResults\nThirty-nine subjects completed this study (74.6 ± 6.4 years).\n Significant increases in steps/day were observed for both the EPA and SoC groups, although the improvements in the EPA group were significantly higher when including only those who adhered to weekly step goals.\n Both groups experienced significant PF improvements, albeit greater in the EPA group for the 8 ft up and go test and knee extension strength.\n\nConclusion\nA low cost, in-home intervention elicited improvements in both PA and PF.\n Future research is warranted to expand upon the size and scope of this study, exploring dose thresholds (and time frames) for PA to improve PF and strategies to further bolster adherence rates to maximize intervention benefits.\n","id":"10.1007/s40520-015-0518-x","idformat":"Springer","foundapis":"_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":" Christopher

strength\/power, muscle mass and deficits in static and particularly dynamic balance due to aging are associated with impaired functional performance and an increased fall risk.\n It has been shown that the combination of balance and strength training (BST) mitigates these age-related deficits.\n However, it is unresolved whether supervised versus unsupervised BST is equally effective in improving muscle power and balance in older adults.\n &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Objective:&lt;\/i&gt;&lt;\/b&gt; This study examined the impact of a 12-week BST program followed by 12 weeks of detraining on measures of balance and muscle power in healthy older adults enrolled in supervised (SUP) or unsupervised (UNSUP) training.\n &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;\/i&gt;&lt;\/b&gt; Sixty-six older adults (men: 25, women: 41; age 73 \u00b1 4 years) were randomly assigned to a SUP group (2\/week supervised training, 1\/week unsupervised training; n = 22), an UNSUP group (3\/week unsupervised training; n = 22) or a passive control group (CON; n = 22).\n Static (i.\ne.\n, Romberg Test) and dynamic (i.\ne.\n, 10-meter walk test) steady-state, proactive (i.\ne.\n, Timed Up and Go Test, Functional Reach Test), and reactive balance (e.\ng.\n, Push and Release Test), as well as lower extremity muscle power (i.\ne.\n, Chair Stand Test; Stair Ascent and Descent Test) were tested before and after the active training phase as well as after detraining.\n &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;\/i&gt;&lt;\/b&gt; Adherence rates to training were 92% for SUP and 97% for UNSUP.\n BST resulted in significant group \u00d7 time interactions.\n Post hoc analyses showed, among others, significant training-related improvements for the Romberg Test, stride velocity, Timed Up and Go Test, and Chair Stand Test in favor of the SUP group.\n Following detraining, significantly enhanced performances (compared to baseline) were still present in 13 variables for the SUP group and in 10 variables for the UNSUP group.\n &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conclusion:&lt;\/i&gt;&lt;\/b&gt; Twelve weeks of BST proved to be safe (no training-related injuries) and feasible (high attendance rates of &gt;90%).\n Deficits of balance and lower extremity muscle power can be mitigated by BST in healthy older adults.\n Additionally, supervised as compared to unsupervised BST was more effective.\n Thus, it is recommended to counteract intrinsic fall risk factors by applying supervised BST programs for older adults.\n","id":"10.1159/000442087","idformat":"CROSSREF","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"PUBLISHER: S.
