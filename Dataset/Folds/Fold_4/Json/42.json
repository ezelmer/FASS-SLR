All consecutive patients in the entire State of Kuwait diagnosed with COVID-19 according to WHO guidelines and admitted to Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah Hospital were included.\n\n Patients received standardized investigations and treatments.\n\n Multivariable analysis was used to determine the associations between risk factors and outcomes (admission to intensive care and/or mortality).\n\n\nFindings\nOf 1096 patients, the median age was 41 years and 81% of patients were male.\n\n Most patients were asymptomatic on admission (46.3%), of whom 35 later developed symptoms, and 59.7% had no signs of infection.\n\n Only 3.6% of patients required an ICU admission and 1.7% were dead at the study's cutoff date.\n\n On multivariable analysis, the risk factors found to be significantly associated with admission to intensive care were age above 50 years old, a qSOFA score above 0, smoking, elevated CRP and elevated procalcitonin levels.\n\n Asthma, smoking and elevated procalcitonin levels correlated significantly with mortality in our cohort.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7335246","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"Elsevier","authors":[{"firstname":"Sulaiman","surname":"Almazeedi","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Sarah","surname":"Al-Youha","email":"sarahalyouha@gmail.com","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Mohammad H.","surname":"Jamal","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Mohannad","surname":"Al-Haddad","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Ali","surname":"Al-Muhaini","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Fahad","surname":"Al-Ghimlas","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Salman","surname":"Al-Sabah","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"}]},{"doi":"10.1136/bmj.m1996","date":"2020-05-18","title":"Characterization and clinical course of 1000 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 in New York: retrospective case series","abstract":"Objective\nTo characterize patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) in a large New York City medical center and describe their clinical course across the emergency department, hospital wards, and intensive care units.\n\n\nDesign\nRetrospective manual medical record review.\n\n\nSetting\nNewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center, a quaternary care academic medical center in New York City.\n\n\nParticipants\nThe first 1000 consecutive patients with a positive result on the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) who presented to the emergency department or were admitted to hospital between 1 March and 5 April 2020.

presentation, hospital course, time to intubation, complications, mortality, and disposition.\n\n\nResults\nOf the first 1000 patients, 150 presented to the emergency department, 614 were admitted to hospital (not intensive care units), and 236 were admitted or transferred to intensive care units.\n\n The most common presenting symptoms were cough (732/1000), fever (728/1000), and dyspnea (631/1000).\n\n Patients in hospital, particularly those treated in intensive care units, often had baseline comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes, and obesity.\n\n Patients admitted to intensive care units were older, predominantly male (158/236, 66.9%), and had long lengths of stay (median 23 days, interquartile range 12-32 days); 78.0% (184/236) developed acute kidney injury and 35.2% (83/236) needed dialysis.\n\n Only 4.4% (6/136) of patients who required mechanical ventilation were first intubated more than 14 days after symptom onset.\n\n Time to intubation from symptom onset had a bimodal distribution, with modes at three to four days, and at nine days.\n\n As of 30 April, 90 patients remained in hospital and 211 had died in hospital.\n\n\nConclusions\nPatients admitted to hospital with covid-19 at this medical center faced major morbidity and mortality, with high rates of acute kidney injury and inpatient dialysis, prolonged intubations, and a bimodal distribution of time to intubation from symptom onset.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7256651","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"BMJ Publishing Group Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Michael

required mechanical ventilation was 35.7% (59/165), with 4.8% of patients (8/165) still on the ventilator at the time of this report.\n\n Overall mortality to date in this critically ill cohort is 30.9% (67/217) and 60.4% (131/217) patients have survived to hospital discharge.\n\n Mortality was significantly associated with older age, lower body mass index, chronic renal disease, higher

March 2020. The follow-up censoring date was 17 April 2020. We collected demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment and complications data.\n\n The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality.\n\n Univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with death.\n\n\nResults\nOf the 4035 patients, male subjects accounted for 2433 (61.0%) of 3987, the median age was 70 years and 2539 (73.8%) of 3439 had one or more comorbidity.\n\n The most common symptoms were a history of fever, cough, malaise and dyspnoea.\n\n During hospitalization, 1255 (31.5%) of 3979 patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, 736 (18.5%) of 3988 were admitted to intensive care units and 619 (15.5%) of 3992 underwent mechanical ventilation.\n\n Virus- or host-targeted medications included lopinavir/ritonavir (2820/4005, 70.4%), hydroxychloroquine (2618/3995, 65.5%), interferon beta (1153/3950, 29.2%), corticosteroids (1109/3965, 28.0%) and tocilizumab (373/3951, 9.4%).\n\n Overall, 1131 (28%) of 4035 patients died.\n\n Mortality increased with age (85.6% occurring in older than 65 years).\n\n Seventeen factors were independently associated with an increased hazard of death, the strongest among them including advanced age, liver cirrhosis, low age-adjusted oxygen saturation, higher concentrations of C-reactive protein and lower estimated glomerular filtration rate.\n\n\nConclusions\nOur findings provide comprehensive information about characteristics and complications of severe COVID-19, and may help clinicians identify patients at a higher risk of death.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7399713","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases.

An understanding of the risk factors and clinical outcomes of hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may provide guidance for management.\n\n\nMethods\nAll laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases in adults admitted to an academic medical center in Seattle, Washington, between 2 March and 26 March 2020 were included.\n\n We evaluated individuals with and without severe disease, defined as admission to the intensive care unit or death.\n\n\nResults\nOne hundred five COVID-19 patients were hospitalized.\n\n Thirty-five percent were admitted from a senior home or skilled nursing facility.\n\n The median age was 69 years, and half were women.\n\n Three or more comorbidities were present in 55% of patients, with hypertension (59%), obesity (47%), cardiovascular disease (38%), and diabetes (33%) being the most prevalent.\n\n Most (63%) had symptoms for ?5 days prior to admission.\n\n Only 39% had fever in the first 24 hours, whereas 41% had hypoxia at admission.\n\n Seventy-three percent of patients had lymphopenia.\n\n Of 50 samples available for additional testing, no viral coinfections were identified.\n\n Severe disease occurred in 49%.\n\n Eighteen percent of patients were placed on mechanical ventilation, and the overall mortality rate was 33%.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the early days of the COVID-19 epidemic in Washington State, the disease had its

laboratory features and short-term outcomes of patients with Corona Virus Disease 2019(COVID-19).\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with COVID-19 admitted to Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital in Wuhan, China, between January 3 and February 1, 2020 were included.\n\n All those patients were with laboratory-confirmed infection.\n\n Epidemiological, clinical, radiological characteristics, underlying diseases, laboratory tests treatment, complications and outcomes data were collected.\n\n Outcomes were followed up at discharge until Feb 15, 2020.\nResults\nThe study cohort included 102 adult patients.\n\n The median (IQR) age was 54 years (37-67years) and 48.0% were female.\n\n A total of 34 patients (33.3%) were exposed to source of transmission in the hospital setting (as health care workers, patients, or visitors) and 10 patients (9.8%) had a familial cluster.\n\n Eighteen patients (17.6%) were admitted to the ICU, and 17 patients died (mortality, 16.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 9.4%-23.9%).\n\n Among patients who survived, they were younger, more likely were health care workers and less likely suffered from comorbidities.\n\n They were also less likely suffered from complications.\n\n There was no difference in drug treatment rates between the survival and non-survival groups.\n\n Patients who survived less likely required admission to the intensive care unit (14.1% vs.\n\n 35.3%).\n\n Chest imaging examination showed that death patients more likely had ground-glass opacity (41.2% vs.\n\n 12.9%).\n\n\nConclusions\nThe mortality rate was high among the COVID-19 patients described in our cohort who met our criteria for inclusion in this analysis.\n\n Patient characteristics seen more frequently in those who died were development of systemic complications following onset of the illness and the severity of disease requiring admission to the ICU.\n\n Our data support those described by others that COVID-19 infection results from human-to-human transmission, including familial clustering of cases, and nosocomial transmission.\n\n There were no differences in mortality among those who did or did not receive antimicrobial or glucocorticoid drug treatment.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7184479","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"Oxford University

China","abstract":"Background\nSince December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and

a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was

Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.\n\n\nFindings\n191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital.\n\n 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients).\n\n Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·031·17, per year increase; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·6112·23; p&lt;0·0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL (18·42, 2·64128·55; p=0·0033) on admission.\n\n Median duration of viral shedding was 20·0 days (IQR 17·024·0) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors.\n\n The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage.\n\n Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.\n\n\nFunding\nChinese Academy of Medical Sciences Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences; National Science Grant for Distinguished Young Scholars; National Key Research and Development Program of China; The Beijing Science and Technology Project; and Major Projects of National Science and Technology on New Drug Creation and Development.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7270627","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Fei","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Ronghui","surname":"Du","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Guohui","surname":"Fan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Ying","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Zhibo","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Jie","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Yeming","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Bin","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Xiaoying","surname":"Gu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Lulu","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Yuan","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Hui","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Xudong","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Jiuyang","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Shengjin","surname":"Tu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Yi","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Hua","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Bin","surname":"Cao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]}]}
