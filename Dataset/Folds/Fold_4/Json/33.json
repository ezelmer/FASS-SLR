rare.\n\n\nMethods\nA systematic literature review was carried out to identify papers on COVID?19, which is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS?CoV?2), using the MEDLINE and Embase databases between January 1 and March 18, 2020.\nResults\nThe search identified 45 relevant scientific papers and letters.\n\n The review showed that children have so far accounted for 1%?5% of diagnosed COVID?19 cases, they often have milder disease than adults and deaths have been extremely rare.\n\n Diagnostic findings have been similar to adults, with fever and respiratory symptoms being prevalent, but fewer children seem to have developed severe pneumonia.\n\n Elevated inflammatory markers were less common in children, and lymphocytopenia seemed rare.\n\n Newborn infants have developed symptomatic COVID?19, but evidence of vertical intrauterine transmission was scarce.\n\n Suggested treatment included providing oxygen, inhalations, nutritional support and maintaining fluids and electrolyte balances.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 has occurred in children, but they seemed to have a milder disease course and better prognosis than adults.\n\n Deaths were extremely rare.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7228328","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"John Wiley and Sons Inc.","authors":[{"firstname":"Jonas

Human Primary T Lymphocytes and Activates the Extrinsic and Intrinsic Apoptosis Pathways","abstract":"Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is associated with a mortality rate of &gt;35%.\n We previously showed that MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) could infect human macrophages and dendritic cells and induce cytokine dysregulation.\n Here, we further investigated the interplay between human primary T cells and MERS-CoV in disease pathogenesis.\n Importantly, our results suggested that MERS-CoV efficiently infected T cells from the peripheral blood and from human lymphoid organs, including the spleen and the tonsil.\n We further demonstrated that MERS-CoV infection induced apoptosis in T cells, which involved the activation of both the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways.\n Remarkably, immunostaining of spleen sections from MERS-CoV–infected common marmosets demonstrated the presence of viral nucleoprotein in their CD3+ T cells.\n Overall, our results suggested that the unusual capacity of MERS-CoV to infect T cells and induce apoptosis might partly contribute to the high pathogenicity of the virus.\n","id":"PMC7107330","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"Oxford University

humans was quickly halted by public health measures and human infections of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) have not been observed since.\n However, other coronaviruses still pose a continuous threat to human health, as exemplified by the recent emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in humans.\n The work on SARS-CoV widens our knowledge on the epidemiology, pathophysiology and immunology of coronaviruses and may shed light on MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV).\n It has been confirmed that T-cell immunity plays an important role in recovery from SARS-CoV infection.\n Herein, we summarize T-cell immunological studies of SARS-CoV and discuss the potential cross-reactivity of the SARS-CoV-specific immunity against MERS-CoV, which may provide useful recommendations for the development of broad-spectrum vaccines against coronavirus infections.\n","id":"PMC7113894","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"Elsevier B.V.","authors":[{"firstname":"William
