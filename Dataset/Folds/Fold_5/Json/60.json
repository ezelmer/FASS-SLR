acute respiratory syndrome?coronavirus?2 (SARS?CoV?2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID?19), is responsible for the largest pandemic since the 1918 influenza A virus subtype H1N1 influenza outbreak.\n\n The symptoms presently recognized by the World Health Organization are cough, fever, tiredness, and difficulty breathing.\n\n Patient?reported smell and taste loss has been associated with COVID?19 infection, yet no empirical olfactory testing on a cohort of COVID?19 patients has been performed.\n\n\nMethods\nThe University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT), a well?validated 40?odorant test, was administered to 60 confirmed COVID?19 inpatients and 60 age? and sex?matched controls to assess the magnitude and frequency of their olfactory dysfunction.\n\n A mixed effects analysis of variance determined whether meaningful differences in test scores existed between the 2 groups and if the test scores were differentially influenced by sex.\n\n\nResults\nFifty?nine (98%) of the 60 patients exhibited some smell dysfunction (mean [95% CI] UPSIT score: 20.98 [19.47, 22.48]; controls: 34.10 [33.31, 34.88]; p &lt; 0.0001).\n\n Thirty?five of the 60 patients (58%) were either anosmic (15/60; 25%) or severely microsmic (20/60; 33%); 16 exhibited moderate microsmia (16/60; 27%), 8 mild microsmia (8/60; 13%), and 1 normosmia (1/60; 2%).\n\n Deficits were evident for all 40 UPSIT odorants.\n\n No meaningful relationships between the test scores and sex, disease severity, or comorbidities were found.\n\n\nConclusion\nQuantitative smell testing demonstrates that decreased smell function, but not always anosmia, is a major marker for SARS?CoV?2 infection and suggests the possibility that smell testing may help, in some cases, to identify COVID?19 patients in need of early treatment or quarantine.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7262123","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"John Wiley and Sons

cross?sectional study evaluating patient?reported symptoms with a focus on smell and taste was conducted using an internet?based platform on adult subjects who underwent testing for COVID?19. Logistic regression was employed to identify symptoms associated with COVID?19 positivity.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 1480 patients with influenza?like symptoms underwent COVID?19 testing between March 3, 2020, and March 29, 2020. Our study captured 59 of 102 (58%) COVID?19–positive patients and 203 of 1378 (15%) COVID?19–negative patients.\n\n Smell and taste loss were reported in 68% (40/59) and 71% (42/59) of COVID?19–positive subjects, respectively, compared to 16% (33/203) and 17% (35/203) of COVID?19–negative patients (p &lt; 0.001).\n\n Smell and taste impairment were independently and strongly associated with COVID?19 positivity (anosmia: adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 10.9; 95% CI, 5.08?23.5; ageusia: aOR 10.2; 95% CI, 4.74?22.1), whereas sore throat was associated with COVID?19 negativity (aOR 0.23; 95% CI, 0.11?0.50).\n\n Of patients who reported COVID?19–associated loss of smell, 74% (28/38) reported resolution of anosmia with clinical resolution of illness.\n\n\nConclusion\nIn ambulatory individuals with influenza?like symptoms, chemosensory dysfunction was strongly associated with COVID?19 infection and should be considered when screening symptoms.\n\n Most will recover chemosensory function within weeks, paralleling resolution of other disease?related symptoms.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7262089","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"John Wiley and Sons Inc.","authors":[{"firstname":"Carol H.","surname":"Yan","email":"c1yan@health.ucsd.edu","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Farhoud","surname":"Faraji","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Farhoud","surname":"Faraji","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Divya P.","surname":"Prajapati","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Divya P.","surname":"Prajapati","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Christine E.","surname":"Boone","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Christine E.","surname":"Boone","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Adam S.","surname":"DeConde","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Adam S.","surname":"DeConde","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]}]}
