Health care workers in hospitals equipped with fever clinics or wards for patients with COVID-19 were eligible.\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nThe degree of symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress was assessed by the Chinese versions of the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, the 7-item Insomnia Severity Index, and the 22-item Impact of Event Scale-Revised, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with mental health outcomes.\nResults\nA total of 1257 of 1830 contacted individuals completed the survey, with a participation rate of 68.7%. A total of 813 (64.7%) were aged 26 to 40 years, and 964 (76.7%) were women. Of all participants, 764 (60.8%) were nurses, and 493 (39.2%) were physicians; 760 (60.5%) worked in hospitals in Wuhan, and 522 (41.5%) were frontline health care workers. A considerable proportion of participants reported symptoms of depression (634 [50.4%]), anxiety (560 [44.6%]), insomnia (427 [34.0%]), and distress (899 [71.5%]). Nurses, women, frontline health care workers, and those working in Wuhan, China, reported more severe degrees of all measurements of mental health symptoms than other health care workers (eg, median [IQR] Patient Health Questionnaire scores among physicians vs nurses: 4.0 [1.0-7.0] vs 5.0 [2.0-8.0]; P = .007; median [interquartile range {IQR}] Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale scores among men vs women: 2.0 [0-6.0] vs 4.0 [1.0-7.0]; P &lt; .001; median [IQR] Insomnia Severity Index scores among frontline vs second-line workers: 6.0 [2.0-11.0] vs 4.0 [1.0-8.0]; P &lt; .001; median [IQR] Impact of Event Scale-Revised scores among those in Wuhan vs those in Hubei outside Wuhan and those outside Hubei: 21.0 [8.5-34.5] vs 18.0 [6.0-28.0] in Hubei outside Wuhan and 15.0 [4.0-26.0] outside Hubei; P &lt; .001). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed participants from outside Hubei province were associated with lower risk of experiencing symptoms of distress compared with those in Wuhan (odds ratio [OR], 0.62; 95% CI, 0.43-0.88; P = .008). Frontline health care workers engaged in direct diagnosis, treatment, and care of patients with COVID-19 were associated with a higher risk of symptoms of depression (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.11-2.09; P = .01), anxiety (OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.22-2.02; P &lt; .001), insomnia (OR, 2.97; 95% CI, 1.92-4.60; P &lt; .001), and distress (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.25-2.04; P &lt; .001).\nConclusions and Relevance\nIn this survey of heath care workers in hospitals equipped with fever clinics or wards for patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan and other regions in China, participants reported experiencing psychological burden, especially nurses, women, those in Wuhan, and frontline health care workers directly engaged in the diagnosis, treatment, and care for patients with COVID-19.\nIntroduction\nSince the end of December 2019, the Chinese city of Wuhan has reported a novel pneumonia caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is spreading domestically and internationally. The virus has been named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In this report, we will refer to the disease, COVID-19. According to data released by the National Health Commission of China, the number of confirmed cases in mainland China has increased to 80 151 as of March 2, 2020, and confirmed cases have been reported in more than a dozen other countries. Moreover, person-to-person transmission has been recorded outside mainland China. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization held an emergency meeting and declared the global COVID-19 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.\nFacing this critical situation, health care workers on the front line who are directly involved in the diagnosis, treatment, and care of patients with COVID-19 are at risk of developing psychological distress and other mental health symptoms. The ever-increasing number of confirmed and suspected cases, overwhelming workload, depletion of personal protection equipment, widespread media coverage, lack of specific drugs, and feelings of being inadequately supported may all contribute to the mental burden of these health care workers. Previous studies have reported adverse psychological reactions to the 2003 SARS outbreak among health care workers. Studies showed that those health care workers feared contagion and infection of their family, friends, and colleagues, felt uncertainty and stigmatization, reported reluctance to work or contemplating resignation, and reported experiencing high levels of stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms, which could have long-term psychological implications. Similar concerns about the mental health, psychological adjustment, and recovery of health care workers treating and caring for patients with COVID-19 are now arising.\nPsychological assistance services, including telephone-, internet-, and application-based counseling or intervention, have been widely deployed by local and national mental health institutions in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. On February 2, 2020, the State Council of China announced that it was setting up nationwide psychological assistance hotlines to help during the epidemic situation. However, evidence-based evaluations and mental health interventions targeting front-line health care workers are relatively scarce.\nTo address this gap, the aim of current study was to evaluate mental health outcomes among health care workers treating patients with COVID-19 by quantifying the magnitude of symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress and by analyzing potential risk factors associated with these symptoms. Participants from Wuhan city (the capital of Hubei province) and other areas inside and outside Hubei province in China were enrolled in this survey to compare interregional differences. This study aimed to provide an assessment of the mental health burden of Chinese health care workers, which can serve as important evidence to direct the promotion of mental well-being among health care workers.\nMethods\nStudy Design\nThis study followed the American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) reporting guideline. Approval from the clinical research ethics committee of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University was received before the initiation of this study. Verbal informed consent was provided by all survey participants prior to their enrollment. Participants were allowed to terminate the survey at any time they desired. The survey was anonymous, and confidentiality of information was assured.\nThe study is a cross-sectional, hospital-based survey conducted via a region-stratified, 2-stage cluster sampling from January 29, 2020, to February 3, 2020. During this period, the total confirmed cases of COVID-19 exceeded 10 000 in China. To compare the interregional differences of mental health outcomes among health care workers in China, samples were stratified by their geographic location (ie, Wuhan, other regions inside Hubei province, and regions outside Hubei province). Because Wuhan was most severely affected, more hospitals in Wuhan were sampled. Hospitals equipped with fever clinics or wards for COVID-19 were eligible to participate in this survey. A total of 20 hospitals in Wuhan (10 designated by the local government to treat COVID-19 and 10 nondesignated), 7 hospitals in other regions of Hubei province, and 7 hospitals from 7 other provinces with a high incidence of COVID-19 (1 hospital from each province) were included. In total, 34 hospitals were involved. Milestone events during the outbreak of COVID-19 and the duration of this study are presented in the eFigure in the Supplement.\nParticipants\nOne clinical department was randomly sampled from each selected hospital, and all health care workers in this department were asked to participate in this study. The target sample size of participants was determined using the formula N = Zalpha2P(1 - P) / d2, in which alpha = 0.05 and Zalpha = 1.96, and the estimated acceptable margin of error for proportion d was 0.1. The proportion of health care workers with psychological comorbidities was estimated at 35%, based on a previous study of the SARS outbreak. To allow for subgroup analyses, we amplified the sample size by 50% with a goal of at least 1070 completed questionnaires from participants.\nOutcomes and Covariates\nWe focused on symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress for all participants, using Chinese versions of validated measurement tools. Accordingly, the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9; range, 0-27), the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale (range, 0-21), the 7-item Insomnia Severity Index (ISI; range, 0-28), and the 22-item Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R; range, 0-88) were used to assess the severity of symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress, respectively. The total scores of these measurement tools were interpreted as follows: PHQ-9, normal (0-4), mild (5-9), moderate (10-14), and severe (15-21) depression; GAD-7, normal (0-4), mild (5-9), moderate (10-14), and severe (15-21) anxiety; ISI, normal (0-7), subthreshold (8-14), moderate (15-21), and severe (22-28) insomnia; and IES-R, normal (0-8), mild (9-25), moderate (26-43), and severe (44-88) distress. These categories were based on values established in the literature.\nThe cutoff score for detecting symptoms of major depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress were 10, 7, 15, and 26, respectively. Participants who had scores greater than the cutoff threshold were characterized as having severe symptoms.\nDemographic data were self-reported by the participants, including occupation (physician or nurse), sex (male or female), age (18-25, 26-30, 31-40, or &gt;40 years), marital status, educational level (&lt;=undergraduate or &gt;=postgraduate), technical title (junior, intermediate, or senior), geographic location (Wuhan, Hubei province outside Wuhan, or outside Hubei province), place of residence (urban or rural), and type of hospital (secondary or tertiary). The different technical titles of respondents refer to the professional titles certificated by the hospital. Participants were asked whether they were directly engaged in clinical activities of diagnosing, treating, or providing nursing care to patients with elevated temperature or patients with confirmed COVID-19. Those who responded yes were defined as frontline workers, and those who answered no were defined as second-line workers.\nStatistical Analysis\nData analysis was performed using SPSS statistical software version 20.0 (IBM Corp). The significance level was set at alpha = .05, and all tests were 2-tailed. The original scores of the 4 measurement tools were not normally distributed and so are presented as medians with interquartile ranges (IQRs). The ranked data, which were derived from the counts of each level for symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress, are presented as numbers and percentages. The nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal-Wallis test were applied to compare the severity of each symptom between 2 or more groups. To determine potential risk factors for symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress in participants, multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed, and the associations between risk factors and outcomes are presented as odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs, after adjustment for confounders, including sex, age, marital status, educational level, technical title, place of residence, working position (first-line or second-line), and type of hospital.\nResults\nDemographic Characteristics\nIn the study, among the 1830 health care workers (702 [38.4%] physicians and 1128 [61.6%] nurses) asked to participate, 1257 respondents (68.7%) completed the survey. The occupational and geographic data of nonrespondents were similar to those of respondents (eTable 1 in the Supplement). Of the 1257 responding participants, 493 (39.2%) were physicians, and 764 (60.8%) were nurses. The response rates for physicians and nurses were 70.2% and 67.7%, respectively. Of the participants, 760 (60.5%) worked in Wuhan, 261 (20.8%) worked in Hubei province outside Wuhan, and 236 (18.8%) worked outside Hubei province. Most participants were women (964 [76.7%]), were aged 26 to 40 years (813 [64.7%]), were married, widowed, or divorced (839 [66.7%]), had an educational level of undergraduate or less (953 [75.8%]), had a junior technical title (699 [55.6%]), and worked in tertiary hospitals (933 [74.2%]). A total of 522 participants (41.5%) were frontline health care workers directly engaged in diagnosing, treating, or caring for patients with or suspected to have COVID-19.

Similar to findings in severity of symptoms, participants who were nurses, women, frontline health care workers, and working in Wuhan had higher scores in all 4 scales compared with those who were physicians, men, second-line health care workers, and working in Hubei province outside Wuhan or outside Hubei province (eg, median [IQR] PHQ-9 scores among physicians vs nurses: 4.0 [1.0-7.0] vs 5.0 [2.0-8.0]; P = .007; median [IQR] GAD-7 scores among men vs women: 2.0 [0-6.0] vs 4.0 [1.0-7.0]; P &lt; .001; median [IQR] ISI scores among frontline vs second-line workers: 6.0 [2.0-11.0] vs 4.0 [1.0-8.0]; P &lt; .001; median [IQR] IES-R scores among those in Wuhan vs those in Hubei outside Wuhan and those outside Hubei: 21.0 [8.5-34.5] vs 18.0 [6.0-28.0] in Hubei outside Wuhan and 15.0 [4.0-26.0] outside Hubei; P &lt; .001) (Table 3). Compared with health care workers in tertiary hospitals, those in secondary hospitals reported higher scores on scales measuring symptoms of depression, anxiety, and insomnia (median [IQR] PHQ-9 score, 4.0 [1.0-7.0] vs 5.0 [2.0-9.0]; P &lt; .001; median [IQR] GAD-7 score, 3.0 [0-7.0] vs 4.0 [1.0-7.0]; P = .005; median [IQR] ISI score, 4.0 [2.0-9.0] vs 6.0 [2.0-10.0]; P = .008). There were no differences in hospital status for scores of distress (median [IQR] IES-R score: workers in tertiary hospitals, 19.0 [7.0-32.0]; workers in secondary hospitals, 20.0 [6.0-31.0]; P = .46). However, frontline health care workers from tertiary and secondary hospitals reported equally high scores on all 4 scales (eg, median [IQR] PHQ-9 score, 5.0 [2.0-8.0] vs 6.0 [3.0-9.0]; P = .08) (Table 4). In pairwise comparisons, participants from Hubei province outside Wuhan and participants outside Hubei province reported similar levels of symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress but were all lower than that of health care workers in Wuhan, the origin of the epidemic (eTable 2 in the Supplement).

Overall, 50.4%, 44.6%, 34.0%, and 71.5% of all participants reported symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress, respectively. Participants were divided in 3 groups (Wuhan, other regions in Hubei province, and regions outside Wuhan province) to compare interregional differences. Most participants were female, were nurses, were aged 26 to 40 years, were married, and worked in tertiary hospitals with a junior technical title. Nurses, women, those working in Wuhan, and frontline workers reported more severe symptoms on all measurements. Our study further indicated that being a woman and having an intermediate technical title were associated with experiencing severe depression, anxiety, and distress. Working in the front line was an independent risk factor for worse mental health outcomes in all dimensions of interest. Together, our findings present concerns about the psychological well-being of physicians and nurses involved in the acute COVID-19 outbreak.\nIn this study, a significant proportion of participants experienced anxiety, depression, and insomnia symptoms, and more than 70% reported psychological distress. In a previous study during the acute SARS outbreak, 89% of health care workers who were in high-risk situations reported psychological symptoms. The psychological response of health care workers to an epidemic of infectious diseases is complicated. Sources of distress may include feelings of vulnerability or loss of control and concerns about health of self, spread of virus, health of family and others, changes in work, and being isolated. The fact that COVID-19 is human-to-human transmissible, associated with high morbidity, and potentially fatal may intensify the perception of personal danger. Additionally, predictable shortages of supplies and an increasing influx of suspected and actual cases of COVID-19 contribute to the pressures and concerns of health care workers.\nOf note, 76.7% of all participants were women, and 60.8% were nurses (90.8% of whom were female). Our findings further indicate that women reported more severe symptoms of depression, anxiety, and distress. Frontline nurses treating patients with COVID-19 are likely exposed to the highest risk of infection because of their close, frequent contact with patients and working longer hours than usual. Moreover, 71.5% of all nurses had junior titles, indicating that most had fewer years of work experience. During the SARS outbreak, a study conducted among health care workers in emergency departments also showed that nurses were more likely to develop distress and use behavioral disengagement than physicians. Frontline nurses treating patients with SARS were physically and psychologically challenged when committing themselves to providing high-quality nursing care for patients. Moreover, at the early stage of the SARS epidemic, nurses may have been less likely to be warned about exposure or provided with adequate protections. Particular attention is warranted regarding the mental health well-being of women and nurses treating patients with COVID-19.\nAnother finding in our study was that, compared with those in Hubei province outside Wuhan and those outside Hubei province, health care workers in Wuhan reported more severe symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that working outside Hubei province was associated with lower risk of experiencing distress. These findings indicated more stress among health care workers in Wuhan, the origin and epicenter of the epidemic in China. In addition, working as a frontline health care worker with direct engagement of patients with COVID-19 was an independent risk factor for all symptoms. As frontline health care workers in Wuhan were at especially high risk for symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress, their mental health may require special attention.\nLimitations\nThis study has several limitations. First, it was limited in scope. Most participants (81.2%) were from Hubei province, limiting the generalization of our findings to less affected regions. Second, the study was carried out during 6 days and lacks longitudinal follow-up. Because of the increasingly arduous situation, the mental health symptoms of health care workers could become more severe. Thus, long-term psychological implications of this population are worth further investigation. Third, this study was unable to distinguish the association of symptoms with being a clinician in this region vs simply living in this region (because there was no comparator group) and was also unable to distinguish preexisting mental health symptoms vs new symptoms. Fourth, although the response rate of this study was 68.7%, response bias may still exist if the nonrespondents were either too stressed to respond or not at all stressed and therefore not interested in this survey.\nConclusions\nIn this survey study of physicians and nurses in hospitals with fever clinics or wards for patients with COVID-19 in China, health care workers responding to the spread of COVID-19 reported high rates of symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress. Protecting health care workers is an important component of public health measures for addressing the COVID-19 epidemic. Special interventions to promote mental well-being in health care workers exposed to COVID-19 need to be immediately implemented, with women, nurses, and frontline workers requiring particular attention.\nReferences\nEarly transmission dynamics in Wuhan, China, of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia\n Updates on the novel coronavirus outbreak up to March 2, 2020.

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

was caused by a novel coronavirus first discovered in Wuhan, Hubei province of China in December 2019. On January 23, 2020, the city of Wuhan with 11 million residents was placed on a city-wide quarantine, and by January 29, 2020, all 31 provinces in China announced the public health emergency. Psychological distress in the general population has been reported in China during the COVID-19 quarantine. The healthcare system in Wuhan was quickly overwhelmed as tens of thousands of people with flu-like symptoms swarmed the hospitals. Frontline healthcare workers (HCWs) in Wuhan have been under tremendous pressure and risk of contracting COVID-19 since the beginning of the quarantine. As of February 12, 2020, 21,569 HCWs from other cities in China have been deployed to support emergency response efforts in Wuhan, while 1716 HCWs have contracted COVID-19 and 5 have died. Two nurses deployed to Wuhan described the situation as &quot;more difficult and extreme than [they] could ever have imagined&quot; and they were &quot;suffering psychologically.&quot; These experiences are consistent with the reports on increased psychological symptoms and conditions in HCWs during and after the SARS epidemic. However, few studies have examined psychological symptoms in frontline HCWs during an outbreak.\nTo examine the psychosocial impact of COVID-19 on frontline HCWs in Wuhan, we collected data between February 13-17, 2020 through a smartphone-based survey. Participants were frontline HCWs from two Wuhan-based hospitals (n = 200) and HCWs in the outreach team (n = 110) deployed to Wuhan from two outside hospitals. Participants reported their demographic characteristics, residence of origin, job type, prior experience with emergency response, whether family members or friends had contracted COVID-19 (Wuhan HCW only), psychological and material/supply preparedness, perceived ability to help patient (self-efficacy), sleep quality, perceived stress via Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), depression via Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), and anxiety via Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). Details about the procedure and measures are included in Appendix A. All procedures involving human participants were approved by the institutional review board at the Shanghai Mental Health Center.\nTo examine the psychosocial impact of COVID-19 on frontline HCWs in Wuhan, we collected data between February 13-17, 2020 through a smartphone-based survey.

The response rate was 30% for Wuhan/local HCWs (n = 60) and 67% for non-Wuhan/outreach HCWs (n = 74). Compared to Wuhan HCWs, outreach HCWs had higher education attainment, were more prepared psychologically and supply-wise, and were generally better adjusted in terms of having better sleep quality, lower perceived stress, and lower depressive symptoms (all ps &lt; .05).\nAppendix B shows the prevalence of elevated depressive (BDI-II scores &gt;= 14) and anxiety symptoms (BAI scores &gt;= 8): 12.7% and 20.1% of HCWs had at least mild depressive and anxiety symptoms, respectively. More than half (59.0%) had moderate to severe levels of perceived stress (PSS scores &gt;= 14). Depressive and anxiety symptoms were more common among women, Wuhan HCWs, those who were less psychologically prepared, lacking psychological preparedness, lacking perceived self-efficacy help patients, and lacking family support, as well as those with poor sleep quality. After adjusting for age, gender, and residence of origin, logistic regression results show that a lack of perceived psychological preparedness, perceived self-efficacy to help the patients, family support; greater perceived stress; or having poor sleep quality were associated with both elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms. Lacking knowledge about COVID-19, higher education attainment, having family or friends infected the virus were also associated with elevated anxiety symptoms. Fear of getting infected for themselves and colleagues were ranked as the top sources of stress and anxiety. Getting medical and daily living supplies were top-ranked in terms of HCWs' current needs (Appendix C).\nAppendix B shows the prevalence of elevated depressive (BDI-II scores &gt;= 14) and anxiety symptoms (BAI scores &gt;= 8): 12.7% and 20.1% of HCWs had at least mild depressive and anxiety symptoms, respectively.

Consistent with prior evidence, our results suggest frontline HCWs in Wuhan during the peak of the outbreak were under moderate to severe stress and many reported elevated anxiety and depression. Wuhan HCWs (vs. outreach), demonstrated greater vulnerability for stress and depression. This study's limitations include relatively small sample sizes; using single-item ratings; low response rate for Wuhan HCWs; potential selection bias (e.g., responders might be healthier and experience more symptoms than non-responders); and lack of information on HCW work hours and workload. Nevertheless, our results suggest frontline HCWs should be closely monitored as a high-risk group for depression and anxiety, and given proper training (e.g., COVID-19 knowledge, stress management, self-care) before deployment; some require psychological interventions. Greater protection gear supplies, on-going monitoring and provision of psychological support, strong family support may also increase frontline HCWs' resilience to stress and psychological symptoms during a public health emergency.\nThe following are the supplementary data related to this article.   \nSupplementary data to this article can be found online at

In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic. It is reported that the number of infected patients is more than 3 024 059, with 208 112 deaths worldwide as of 29 April 2020 (). This makes COVID-19 more serious than SARS, a similar epidemic disease. The Chinese government has implemented numerous measures, including quarantines, reducing the use of public transportation and temporarily cancelling work and school, to control this disease. In addition, government authorities sent about 30 000 medical staff from each Chinese province to fight COVID-19. COVID-19 is characterised by complexity, including human-to-human transmission, asymptomatic carrier transmission and high transmission efficiency, which has led to a worldwide pandemic. Medical staff are frontline workers who treat infected patients, however, with a higher risk of exposure to themselves. Current source data have presented the proportion of infected medical staff at 3.8%, mainly due to early non-protected contact with infected patients. Several previous studies reported that medical staff might suffer adverse psychological disorders, such as anxiety, fear and stigmatisation, which occurred during the SARS and Ebola outbreaks, and could exert an adverse effect on care quality. Medical staff must wear heavy protective garments and an N95 mask, making it much more difficult to carry out medical operations or procedures than under normal conditions. These factors, together with the fear of being contagious and infecting others, could increase the possibility of psychological issues among medical staff. Koh et al. found that more than half of the clinical staff reported increased work stress (56%) and workload (53%) during the SARS epidemic in Singapore. In addition, a Hong Kong study found that health workers suffered high anxiety scores after directly treating confirmed SARS patients. Therefore, it is very important to study medical workers' mental health status. This outbreak has highlighted the fragility of mental resilience. Studies exploring the prevalence of anxiety among medical staff during the COVID-19 outbreak in China are limited. Our study's aim was to examine the anxiety levels of frontline healthcare workers and to identify the risk factors for anxiety in China during the COVID-19 epidemic. Our findings might help governments or health authorities to recognise the causes of increased anxiety in healthcare workers, and then to provide early effective measures to reduce that anxiety.\nMethods\nThis is a descriptive quantitative cross-sectional study that was used to explore the prevalence and factors linked to anxiety in frontline medical staff. Data were collected from 10 February 2020 to 20 February 2020 in China during the COVID-19 epidemic. Informed consent was provided by subjects before study commencement. After that, we distributed self-report questionnaires to healthcare workers via WeChat.\nStudy participants\nParticipating healthcare staff included doctors, nurses and administrative workers at hospitals equipped with a fever clinic or a COVID-19 ward in different regions in China. Administrative staff work in administration and did not directly engage in the treatment or care of infected patients.\nMaterials\nThe questionnaire consisted of three sections: (1) Demographic characteristics, such as gender, age, marital status, level of education, hospital department and city. (2) Questions included the following: e.g. Have you ever directly treated a patient with COVID-19? Have you been to Hubei province in the last month? Are you a suspect case who had direct contact with a confirmed case or do you have fever, fatigue, cough? Did you adhere to the preventive and control measures in your community? Do you need psychological treatment? (3) The Zung Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) was used to assess anxiety levels in medical staff. In SAS, there are 20 items ranked on a 1-4 scale, with total raw scores ranging from 20 to 80. In addition, published studies conducted in China have reported satisfactory reliability and validity. The higher the score, the higher the degree of anxiety. The SAS scores were classified into four categories, including normal (&lt;=49), mild anxiety (50-59), moderate anxiety (60-70) and severe anxiety (&gt;=70), after standardizing the score based on raw data multiplied by 1.25. Previous studies have shown that SAS internal consistency reliability was 0.66-0.80 and the Cronbach's alpha was 0.87.\nEthical considerations\nEthical approval from the ethics committee of the People's Hospital of Baoan District, Shenzhen (Certificate: BYL20200202) was obtained, with written consent provided by all participants. Medical staff whose SAS scores were more than 60 points were informed of their score and a researcher contacted them to ask whether they wanted psychological treatment. If they accepted, our team helped them make an online appointment for a psychological consultation.\nStatistical data analyses\nContinuous and categorical variates were summarised as mean values +- standard deviation (s.d.) and frequency (percentage), respectively. We used the chi2 test to identify the differences in categorical variables between groups, and the Student's t test was used to determine the differences in continuous variables between groups. If the data showed a skewed distribution, the Kruskal-Wallis H test was used. In addition, a univariate analysis model was used to identify the relationship between risk factors and anxiety score. Finally, our paper also lists the unadjusted and adjusted multivariate linear regression analysis model. Statistically significant differences were identified as a two-sided P value &lt;0.05. All analyses were conducted using EmpowerStats (, X&amp;Y Solutions, Inc., Boston, MA, USA) and software package R ().\nResults\nParticipant demographic data\nVariables	Mean + s.d, or N,%	 	Anxiety score	39.56 +- 8.91	 	Gender	N (%)	 	Female	433 (84.57%)	 	Male	79 (15.43%)	 	Age group	 	18-39	386 (75.39%)	 	40-59	125 (24.41%)	 	&gt;=60	1 (0.20%)	 	Education	 	Middle school or lower	2 (0.39%)	 	High school or higher	24 (4.69%)	 	College or higher	486 (94.92%)	 	Marital status	 	Single	185 (36.13%)	 	Married	320 (62.50%)	 	Divorced	7 (1.37%)	 	Hubei province	 	No	439 (85.74%)	 	Yes	73 (14.26%)	 	Location	 	Countryside	8 (1.56%)	 	City	504 (98.44%)	 	Suspect cases	 	No	471 (91.99%)	 	Yes	41 (8.01%)	 	Department	 	Clinical department	369 (72.07%)	 	Fever clinic	68 (13.28%)	 	Service/managerial	75 (14.65%)	 	Have direct treatment	 	No	348 (67.97%)	 	Yes	164 (32.03%)	 	Satisfaction with community prevention	 	No	468 (91.41%)	 	Yes	44 (8.59%)	 	Need psychological treatment	 	No	463 (90.43%)	 	Yes	49 (9.57%)	 	Anxiety	 	Normal	448 (87.5%)	 	Mild	53 (10.35%)	 	Moderate	7 (1.36%)	 	Severe	4 (0.78%)	 	\nPatient baseline characteristics are presented in Table 1. \nA total of 600 medical staff was surveyed, with 512 subjects completing the questionnaire and a dropout rate of 14.6%. The majority of the sample was female (84.57%) and the largest age group was 18-39 years old. Most sample participants were married (62.50%) and the majority of subjects had a tertiary level of education. Most health workers came from a clinical department (72.07%), with 13.28% setting up clinics to screen patients for fever, and 14.65% involved in administration.

In addition, all of these associations were still significant after adjusting for the variables of gender, age, education and marital status, with detailed results shown in Table 4. \nDiscussion\nOur study examined the prevalence of anxiety in medical staff and identified their risk factors for increased anxiety. Our results found that working in COVID-19 patient care, suspect cases and living in Hubei province were all risk factors for increased anxiety scores, which is an important finding suggesting that government authorities need to implement measures to alleviate mental health symptoms in healthcare workers early on. New bio-disasters - including SARS, Ebola, H1N1, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and the novel coronavirus - are profoundly associated with adverse psychological effects on medical staff, including depression, anxiety and insomnia. Using SAS, we found that 12.5% of medical staff experienced anxiety, which is less than in a recent study by Lai et al., in which 44.6% of respondents reported anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak. The main possible reasons were the different tool assessments and different stages of COVID-19. By the time our study was conducted, nearly 4 weeks after the first COVID-19 patient was confirmed in Wuhan, China at the end of December 2019, healthcare workers had apparently had sufficient time to adjust to caring for infected patients and to feel confident in doing so. In addition, government and healthcare authorities were providing stricter and safer protective measures to support them, which to some extent reduced worker anxiety, in contrast to the early peak of the epidemic. However, a study by Jeong et al. reported the prevalence of anxiety symptoms in the general population who were not diagnosed with MERS and required 2 weeks of isolation was 7.6% (95% CI 6.3-8.9%), which is less than in our study. The discrepancy might be due to the fact that there were only 267 health workers (16.1%), and the authors used the seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale to assess anxiety, with a cut-off of 5 points confirming mild anxiety. Nevertheless, medical workers who provided direct treatment or care for infected patients suffered higher anxiety scores, compared to those who were not caring for COVID-19 patients. Previous studies have reported that psychological symptoms, such as anxiety, depend on the epidemic phase. This is because medical workers might have been able to adapt psychologically, after gradually learning more about SARS and obtaining rich clinical experience in the treatment and care of infected patients.\nThe results show that health workers from Hubei, the most severely affected area, had higher anxiety scores (beta value = 3.71, CI 1.53-5.90; P = 0.0009) compared to health workers from other regions. Staff working in hospitals in Hubei suffered heavy workloads due to the increasing number of infected cases requiring centralisation to designated hospitals for standard isolation treatment. Additionally, the media have reported that medically protective materials, such as N95 masks, goggles and protective clothing, were severely deficient during the early stages of the outbreak. All of these factors invisibly aggravated the psychological burden.\nIn addition, our results found that staff with suspect infection cases had higher anxiety scores than non-suspect cases (beta value = 4.44, CI 1.55-7.33; P = 0.0028). Wu et al. conducted a survey on the psychological problems of hospital employees during the SARS epidemic, and found that respondents who were quarantined had higher levels of post-traumatic stress than those without exposure. Medical staff became suspect cases mainly through hospital-related transmission. Suspect cases with a high risk of infection were required to remain isolated for 2 weeks under medical observation. During that time, they might have suffered a dilemma: on the one hand, most people fear becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2, while on the other hand, they struggle with not taking on responsibility for fighting COVID-19. They also worry about the health risks to their own family, leading to a psychological burden. This complex situation could further intensify anxiety in medical staff. Therefore, governments should focus on potential psychological problems among suspect cases in medical staff, and provide effective mental health measures to alleviate suffering.\nAfter adjusting the confounding factors, providing direct treatment to infected patients was an independent factor in increased anxiety scores, compared to not providing direct treatment to COVID-19 patients. Our finding is in line with a recent study conducted on healthcare workers at the onset of the infection outbreak. This study found that healthcare workers who directly diagnosed, treated or looked after patients with COVID-19 were more stressed and psychologically impacted than workers who did not have direct contact with COVID cases. Participating in treatments or procedures for infected patients was challenging for frontline staff, who experienced stress, as they were at high potential risk of infection due to the illness' characteristics of high transmission efficiency, rapid deterioration and pathogenicity. Hence, healthcare workers, such as those having direct contact with patients, suffered higher anxiety symptom scores than staff who were at low risk. Therefore, although the Chinese government and society compliment medical personnel for their dedication in fighting COVID-19 - which could make medical workers feel honoured and proud to participate in this difficult mission - authorities should also focus on implementing measures to target workers' mental health. As the SARS-Cov-2 epidemic is a global issue, fighting COVID-19 appears to be a sustained event, which might result in medical personnel suffering psychological problems.\nOur study has some limitations. First, the questionnaires were distributed non-randomly via WeChat, so a selective bias exists in our study. Additionally, the number of medical staff from Hubei was in a minority (14.26%), which means that our study does not completely reflect the entire mental health picture of Chinese medical staff in quarantine. Second, we did not investigate other important outcomes, such as insomnia, depression and post-traumatic stress related to the functioning of healthcare workers. Therefore, we cannot provide information about how mild anxiety has any impact on the function of medical workers. It would be worthwhile to study these possible factors in future research. Third, we used the SAS, which is widely applied in China, but is an old anxiety scale now rarely used in Western countries. In order to keep the questionnaire at a reasonable length and to promote an acceptable response rate, we did not use the Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders (CCMD), International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-11) or Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th edition (DSM-5 scale) to evaluate anxiety, which could possibly have jeopardised the generalisation of our study and limited its effectiveness in providing more information for other countries around the world. Fourth, COVID-19-related anxiety is in fact likely to be dynamic, waxing and waning in response to stressors. Medical workers' anxiety may spike, for example, when there is a surge of patients into their hospital, and abate when the influx of cases abates. Wang et al. reported a study that explored the immediate psychological responses during the initial stage of the COVID-19 epidemic in China and found the prevalence of anxiety (28.8% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms) was higher than in our study, since their study period was at the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, with similar results reported by Lai et al. (44.6% had anxiety symptoms). In our study, however, we were unable to explore anxiety in healthcare workers at a different time; therefore, we cannot compare our results to the different stages of anxiety among healthcare workers. Fifth, our study used a cross-sectional design that cannot determine causality for factors and outcome. In addition, a comprehensive assessment, including demographic factors, such as years of experience, having children or not and a history of mental disorders, would be beneficial in analysing potential anxiety factors. Finally, we were unable to distinguish pre-existing anxiety vs. new cases of anxiety. However, our study also has some strengths. To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess anxiety levels among medical staff in China during the period of COVID-19, and we used comprehensive statistical data analyses to ensure our results are reliable. In addition, our findings have the potential to encourage policymakers and governments to consider offering early interventions to alleviate possible mental health problems in medical workers.\nConclusion\nOur study found the prevalence of anxiety is mild; however, medical staff who had had direct contact through treatment of infected patients may experience an increase in their anxiety scores, compared to workers having no direct contact with infected patients. In addition, healthcare workers who were quarantined in Hubei province and those who were suspect cases also saw increased anxiety scores. Therefore, governments and healthcare authorities should proactively implement appropriate measures, such as providing psychological counselling services, to prevent, alleviate or treat increased anxiety among medical staff, especially in the worst affected areas, during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAuthor contributions\nXiao-Ming Zhang and Chenyun Liu had full access to all study data and take responsibility for data integrity and accuracy of the data analysis.

The combination of eosinopenia and elevated hs-CRP yielded a sensitivity of 67·9% and specificity of 78·2% (AUC=0·730).\n\n The addition of eosinopenia alone or the combination of eosinopenia and elevated hs-CRP into the guideline-recommended diagnostic parameters for COVID-19 improved the predictive capacity with higher than zero of both net reclassification improvement (NRI) and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI).\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe combination of eosinopenia and elevated hs-CRP can effectively triage suspected COVID-19 patients from other patients attending the fever clinic with COVID-19-like initial symptoms.\n\n This finding would be particularly useful for designing triage strategies in an epidemic region having a large number of patients with COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases while limited medical resources for nucleic acid tests and radiographic examination.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7196382","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier","authors":[{"firstname":"Qilin","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiuli","surname":"Ding","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Geqing","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Heng-Gui","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fenghua","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhi","surname":"Geng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Luming","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shijun","surname":"Lei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"An","surname":"Pan","email":"panan@hust.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin","surname":"Wang","email":"lin_wang@hust.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng","surname":"Wang","email":"zhengwang@hust.edu.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1001/jamacardio.2020.0950","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Association of cardiac injury with mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1001/jamacardio.2020.1017","date":"2020-03-09","title":"Cardiovascular Implications of Fatal Outcomes of Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)","abstract":"This case series study evaluates the association of underlying cardiovascular disease and myocardial injury on fatal outcomes in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n","id":"PMC7101506","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"American Medical Association","authors":[{"firstname":"Tao","surname":"Guo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yongzhen","surname":"Fan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ming","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoyan","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tao","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hairong","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Wan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xinghuan","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhibing","surname":"Lu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30566-3","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study","abstract":"Background\nSince December, 2019, Wuhan, China, has experienced an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).\n\n Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (?18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020.

Survey of UK Healthcare Workers’ Attitudes on Volunteering to Help with the Ebola Outbreak in West Africa","abstract":"Objective\nTo understand the barriers and enablers for UK healthcare workers who are considering going to work in the current Ebola outbreak in West Africa, but have not yet volunteered.\n\n\nDesign\nAfter focus group discussions, and a pilot questionnaire, an anonymous survey was conducted using SurveyMonkey to determine whether people had considered going to West Africa, what factors might make them more or less likely to volunteer, and whether any of these were modifiable factors.\n\n\nParticipants\nThe survey was publicised among doctors, nurses, laboratory staff and allied health professionals.\n\n 3109 people answered the survey, of whom 472 (15%) were considering going to work in the epidemic but had not yet volunteered.\n\n 1791 (57.6%) had not considered going, 704 (22.6%) had considered going but decided not to, 53 (1.7%) had volunteered to go and 14 (0.45%) had already been and worked in the epidemic.\n\n\nResults\nFor those considering going to West Africa, the most important factor preventing them from volunteering was a lack of information to help them decide; fear of getting Ebola and partners’ concerns came next.\n\n Uncertainty about their potential role, current work commitments and inability to get agreement from their employer were also important barriers, whereas clarity over training would be an important enabler.\n\n In contrast, for those who were not considering going, or who had decided against going, family considerations and partner concerns were the most important factors.\n\n\nConclusions\nMore UK healthcare workers would volunteer to help tackle Ebola in West Africa if there was better information available, including clarity about roles, cover arrangements, and training.\n\n This could be achieved with a well-publicised high quality portal of reliable information.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4356617","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

the growth and progression of oral cancer.\n\n Patients with oral neoplasms can have high psychological distress levels, but the effects of stress-related hormones on oral neoplasm growth are unknown.\n\n\nMethods\nWe have investigated the relationships between pre-surgical measurements of psychological problems with Symptom Checklist-90-revised Inventory (SCL90-R), tumor histology, circulating blood catecholamine and glucocorticoid levels among 75 oral neoplasm patients, including 40 oral cancer patients and 35 benign oral tumor patients.\n\n\nResults\nThe results showed that most dimension scores of SCL90-R did not show a significant difference between the two groups except depression (p?=?0.0201) and obsessive-compulsion (p?=?0.0093), with the scores for these symptoms being higher among oral cancer group versus the benign oral tumor group.\n\n The differences of total score, average score and other monomial factor scores were not statistically significant.\n\n The mean concentrations of catecholamine and glucocorticoid in peripheral blood of the oral cancer group were higher than those in benign oral tumor group (p&lt;0.01).\n\n We also examined whether associations observed between biobehavioral measures and circulating blood catecholamine and glucocorticoid levels extended to other compartments in the oral cancer group.\n\n\nConclusions\nThese findings suggest that stress hormones may affect oral cancer behavior by influencing the tumor micro-environment though the circulating blood.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4105410","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

Hostility Questionnaire (HDHQ), the Symptom Checklist 90-R (SCL 90-R), the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (ZDRS), and the Maudsley O-C Inventory Questionnaire (MOCI).\n Blood samples were taken by measuring homocysteine and cortisol in both subgroups during the initial phase of the study (T0).\n One year later (T1), the uncontrolled diabetic patients were reevaluated with the use of the same psychometric instruments and with an identical blood analysis.\n Results.\n The relation of psychoticism and homocysteine is positive among controlled diabetic patients (P value = 0.006 &lt; 0.05) and negative among uncontrolled ones (P value = 0.137).\n Higher values of cortisol correspond to lower scores on extraversion subscale (r\np = ?0.223, P value = 0.010).\n Controlled diabetic patients showed a statistically significant negative relationship between homocysteine and the act-out hostility subscale (r\nsp = ?0.247, P = 0.023).\n There is a statistically significant relationship

Four hundred and twenty five people developed clinical symptoms in three geographically distinct parts of the country (Gulu, Masindi, and Mbarara), of whom 224 (53%) died.\n\n Given the focus of previous social scientific Ebola research on experiences in communities that have been directly affected, this article expands the lens to include responses to the outbreak in local, national, and international contexts over the course of the outbreak.\n\n\nMethods\nResponses to the outbreak were gauged through the articles, editorials, cartoons, and letters that were published in the country’s two main English language daily national newspapers: the New Vision and the Monitor (now the Daily Monitor).\n\n All the relevant pieces from these two sources over the course of the epidemic were cut out, entered onto a computer, and the originals filed.\n\n The three a priori codes, based on the local, national, and international levels, were expanded into six, to include issues that emerged inductively during analysis.\n\n The data within each code were subsequently worked into coherent, chronological narratives.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 639 cuttings were included in the analysis.\n\n Strong and varied responses to the outbreak were identified from across the globe.\n\n These included, among others: confusion, anger, and serious stigma in affected communities; medical staff working themselves to exhaustion, with some quitting their posts; patients fleeing from hospitals; calls on spiritual forces for protection against infection; a well-coordinated national control strategy; and the imposition of some international travel restrictions.\n\n Responses varied both quantitatively and qualitatively according to the level (i.\n\ne.\n\n local, national, or international) at which they were manifested.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe Ugandan experience of 2000/2001 demonstrates that responses to an Ebola outbreak can be very dramatic, but perhaps disproportionate to the actual danger presented.\n\n An important objective for any future outbreak control strategy must be to prevent excessive fear, which, it is expected, would reduce stigma and other negative outcomes.\n\n To this end, the value of openness in the provision of public information, and critically, of being seen to be open, cannot be overstated.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3477054","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"John","surname":"Kinsman","email":"john.kinsman@epiph.umu.se","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Addressing Ebola-related stigma: lessons learned from HIV/AIDS","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.2105/AJPH.2015.302790","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Ebola Outbreak: From the Perspective of African Migrants in China","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Support services for survivors of ebola virus disease -

coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7121484","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical Society","authors":[{"firstname":"Qun","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuhua","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoye","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yeqing","surname":"Tong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ruiqi","surname":"Ren","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kathy S.M.","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Eric H.Y.","surname":"Lau","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jessica Y.","surname":"Wong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuesen","surname":"Xing","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nijuan","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chao","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tian","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Man","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wenxiao","surname":"Tu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chuding","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lianmei","surname":"Jin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rui","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Suhua","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rui","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yinbo","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ge","surname":"Shao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhongfa","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhiqiang","surname":"Deng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Boxi","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhitao","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yanping","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guoqing","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tommy T.Y.","surname":"Lam","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Joseph T.","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"George F.","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Benjamin J.","surname":"Cowling","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gabriel M.","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zijian","surname":"Feng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":" Updates on the novel coronavirus outbreak up to March 2, 2020.

studied.\n Ten nurses who had suffered from SARS were interviewed, either face?to?face or by telephone, about their subjective experiences.\n These interviews provided in?depth, descriptive data, which were analysed using content analysis.\n Nine broad categories were identified: uncertainty, information control, feelings of anger and guilt, lack of preparation and fear of death, feelings of isolation and loneliness, physical effects, support, change of perspective of life, and change of perspective of nursing.\n Although the dreaded disease affected the nurses tremendously, both physically and psychologically, it has also had its positive side.\n As a result of experiencing the illness, the participants came to treasure relationships, health and everyday life more.\n In caring for patients, they came to see the world more from the perspective of the patients.\n They found that they need to take the time to reassure patients and families and to seriously listen to all

the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41

(one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41

coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China and has swiftly spread to other parts of China and a number of foreign countries.\n The 2019-nCoV cases might have been under-reported roughly from 1 to 15 January 2020, and thus we estimated the number of unreported cases and the basic reproduction number, R0, of 2019-nCoV.\n Methods: We modelled the epidemic curve of 2019-nCoV cases, in mainland China from 1 December 2019 to 24 January 2020 through the exponential growth.\n The number of unreported cases was determined by the maximum likelihood estimation.\n We used the serial intervals (SI) of infection caused by two other well-known coronaviruses (CoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) CoVs, as approximations of the unknown SI for 2019-nCoV to estimate R0.\n Results: We confirmed that the initial growth phase followed an exponential growth pattern.\n The under-reporting was likely to have resulted in 469 (95% CI: 403–540) unreported cases from 1 to 15 January 2020. The reporting rate after 17 January 2020 was likely to have increased 21-fold (95% CI: 18–25) in comparison to the situation from 1 to 17 January 2020 on average.\n We estimated the R0 of 2019-nCoV at 2.56 (95% CI: 2.49–2.63).\n Conclusion: The under-reporting was likely to have occurred during the first half of January 2020 and should be considered in future investigation.\n","id":"PMC7074332","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"Shi","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Salihu S.","surname":"Musa","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Salihu S.","surname":"Musa","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qianying","surname":"Lin","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Qianying","surname":"Lin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jinjun","surname":"Ran","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Guangpu","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Weiming","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yijun","surname":"Lou","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Yijun","surname":"Lou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Daozhou","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Daihai","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Daihai","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Maggie H.","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Maggie H.","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2001316","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Early Transmission Dynamics in Wuhan, China, of Novel Coronavirus–Infected Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nThe initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

to date.\n\n Many of the lessons learned from identifying, containing and treating that epidemic are applicable to future viral outbreaks, natural disasters and bioterrorist attacks.\n\n This is due to Ebola's highly contagious nature and high mortality rate.\n\n\nResults\nWhen an outbreak occurs, it often produces fear in the community and causes the basic practice of medicine to be altered.\n\n Changes seen at Kikwit included limited physical examinations, hesitance to give intravenous medications and closure of supporting hospital facilities.\n\n The Kikwit Ebola outbreak also provided beneficial psychological insight into how patients, staff and the general community respond to a biological crisis and how this will affect physicians working in an epidemic.\n\n\nConclusions\nGeneral

consequences of the epidemic.\n Ebola is a traumatic illness both in terms of symptom severity and mortality rates.\n Those affected are likely to experience psychological effects due to the traumatic course of the infection, fear of death and experience of witnessing others dying.\n Survivors can also experience psychosocial consequences due to feelings of shame or guilt (e.\ng.\n from transmitting infection to others) and stigmatization or blame from their communities.\n At the community level, a cyclical pattern of fear occurs, with a loss of trust in health services and stigma, resulting in disruptions of community interactions and community break down.\n Health systems in affected countries were severely disrupted and overstretched by the outbreak and their capacities were significantly reduced as almost 900 health-care workers were infected with Ebola and more than 500 died.\n The outbreak resulted in an increased need for health services, reduced quality of life and economic productivity and social system break down.\n It is essential that the global response to the outbreak considers both acute and long-term psychosocial needs of individuals and communities.\n Response efforts should involve communities to address psychosocial need, to rebuild health systems and trust and to limit stigma.\n The severity of this epidemic and its long-lasting repercussions

coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and Prevention of Infectious Disease in China, Chinese Academy of

governments in collecting data and conducting research in affected individuals.\n\n Recent developments in Web-based and smartphone technologies have offered government and nongovernment organizations a new system to disseminate and acquire information.\n\n However, research into this area is still lacking.\n\n The current study focuses largely on how new social networking websites and, in particular, smartphone technologies could have helped in the acquisition of crucial research data from the general population during the recent 2013 Southeast Asian Haze.\n\n This crisis lasted only for 1 week, and is unlike other crisis where there are large-scale consequential after-effects.\n\n\nObjective\nTo determine whether respondents will make use of Internet, social media, and smartphone technologies to provide feedback regarding their physical and psychological wellbeing during a crisis, and if so, will these new mechanisms be as effective as conventional, technological, Internet-based website technologies.\n\n\nMethods\nA Web-based database and a smartphone application were developed.\n\n Participants were recruited by snowball sampling.\n\n The participants were recruited either via a self-sponsored Facebook post featuring a direct link to the questionnaire on physical and psychological wellbeing and also a smartphone Web-based application; or via dissemination of the questionnaire link by emails, directed to the same group of participants.\n\n Information pertaining to physical and psychological wellbeing was collated.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 298 respondents took part in the survey.\n\n Most of them were between the ages of 20 to 29 years and had a university education.\n\n More individuals preferred the option of accessing and providing feedback to a survey on physical and psychological wellbeing via direct access to a Web-based questionnaire.\n\n Statistical analysis showed that demographic variables like age, gender, and educational levels did not influence the mechanism of access.\n\n\nIn addition, the participants reported a mean number of 4.03 physical symptoms (SD 2.6).\n\n The total Impact of Event Scale–Revised (IES-R) score was 18.47 (SD 11.69), which indicated that the study population did experience psychological stress but not post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\n The perceived dangerous Pollutant

The study focuses on assess the psychological status of them. The authors conducted a single-center, cross-sectional survey via online questionnaires. Occurrence of fear, anxiety and depression were measured by the numeric rating scale (NRS) on fear, Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA), and Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD), respectively. A total of 2299 eligible participants were enrolled from the authors' institution, including 2042 medical staff and 257 administrative staff. The severity of fear, anxiety and depression were significantly different between two groups. Furthermore, as compared to the non-clinical staff, front line medical staff with close contact with infected patients, including working in the departments of respiratory, emergency, infectious disease, and ICU, showed higher scores on fear scale, HAMA and HAMD, and they were 1.4 times more likely to feel fear, twice more likely to suffer anxiety and depression. The medical staff especially working in above-mentioned departments made them more susceptible to psychological disorders. Effective strategies toward to improving the mental health should be provided to these individuals.\nIntroduction\nIn December 2019, an outbreak of a novel coronavirus pneumonia occurred in Wuhan City, China, and spread throughout the whole of country in a short period. The novel coronavirus was officially named 'SARS-CoV-2' by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, and disease infected by this virus was termed 'COVID-19'. Since the rapid spread of this epidemic disease, the government of China has quickly issued a public announcement on the prevention and treatment of the most serious infectious disease, which required that determine efficacious and straightforward measures to prevent disease transmission. However, coronavirus pneumonia patients were found in almost all provinces across our country in the short term. There was no doubt that medical workforce played an indispensable role in this major public health emergency.\nAs generally known, this pandemic was more contagious than SARS and brought challenge and threaten to global public health security. As a general provincial hospital in South China, our institution undertook a considerable number of investigations and diagnosis of suspected patients. Hospital staff were exposed to stress both physical and psychological in response to this serious infectious public health event. Initially a comparison was conducted across hospital staff in due to the fact that the potential for work-related accumulated in declining mental health of them, yet had not been examined during the epidemic of major infectious diseases. Besides, a study demonstrated that 42.0% of doctors working in Tertiary Hospitals in mainland China experienced very high levels of accumulated fatigue. Especially during SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, the heavier workload and life-threatening medical workers were facing aggravated the psychological pressure, even mental illness. Follow-up data suggested that hospital workers particularly doctor and nurse were more susceptible to psychological disorders after participating in the treatment of SARS patients over a decade ago. In particular, increasing number of confirmed and suspected cases were verified in many countries outside China. Therefore, it is extremely important to realize the psychological status of the medical workforce.\nMethods\nParticipants\nMedical workforce from Fujian Provincial Hospital fighting against SARS-CoV-2 have participated in epidemic prevention and control work for a month since the government launched the first-level response to major public health emergencies on Jan 24 2020. A questionnaire survey personal assessment of fear, anxiety and depression was conducted for them. In addition, gender, age, working years, education, marriage status, and fertility status were also collected. Complete questionnaires finished within two days from Feb 25 2020 to Feb 26 2020 were recognized as eligible and included in the following analysis. Incomplete questionnaires and participants with a history of psychological or cognitive disorder were excluded. The present study was approved by the local Ethics Committee of the Fujian Provincial Hospital and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects.\nAssessment of fear\nThe numeric rating scale (NRS) has been reported to have good reliability, validity and sensitivity, which is used to measure the level of fear in the study. The degree of fear is reflected using 0-10 point, with higher score indicating greater fear. Details of the scale is as follows: 0 for no fear, 1-3 for mild fear, 4-6 for moderate fear, 7-9 for severe fear, 10 for extreme fear and psychological anxiety.\nQuestionnaire measurement of anxiety and depression\nHamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) and Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) have been wildly used to assess the appearance of anxiety and depression. HAMA contains 14 questions, and HAMD contains 17. Each question includes 5 items. Responses are scored as 0 (never), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), 3 (severe), or 4 (extremely serious). Overall, the total score of HAMA is operationally categorized as follows: no anxiety (score 0-6), mild and moderate anxiety (score 7-13), severe anxiety (score &gt;= 14). The total score of HAMD can be classified into normal (score 0-6), mild and moderate (score 7-23), severe depression (score &gt;= 24). Various of previous studies had shown that these questionnaires could assess psychological condition with satisfactory reliability and validity.\nStatistical analyses\nThe data were analyzed via Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS, version 22.0, Chicago, IL) software. Qualitative variables were described by frequency distribution, while quantitative variables were described by the mean and standard deviation. The two-tailed Chi-square test and rank-sum test were employed to compare the distribution of qualitative and quantitative variables, respectively. Multivariate analyses for fear, anxiety and depression were performed using the ordinal logistic regression model. Statistical significance was evaluated as p &lt; 0.05 for all tests.\nResults\nParticipants' characteristics\nBaseline characteristics of 2299 enrolled participants in the study.\nTable 1	 	\nVariables	Medical staff (n = 2042)	Administrative staff (n = 257)	chi2	P value	 	Gender			0.775	0.379	 	Male	451 (22.1)	63 (24.5)			 	Female	1591 (77.9)	194 (75.5)			 	Age (years)			11.182	0.011	 	&lt;30	791 (38.7)	73 (28.4)			 	31-40	810 (39.7)	119 (46.3)			 	41-50	303 (14.8)	48 (18.7)			 	&gt;50	138 (6.8)	17 (6.6)			 	Working years			4.575	0.206	 	&lt;5	575 (28.2)	74 (28.8)			 	5-10	683 (33.4)	100 (38.9)			 	11-20	380 (18.6)	43 (16.7)			 	&gt;20	404 (19.8)	40 (15.6)			 	Provincial location			7.861	0.049	 	Eastern	1431 (70.1)	196 (76.3)			 	Southern	170 (8.3)	24 (9.3)			 	Northwestern	262 (12.8)	19 (7.4)			 	Othersa	179 (8.8)	18 (7.0)			 	Education			23.044	&lt; 0.001	 	Below university	596 (29.2)	98 (38.1)			 	College	984 (48.2)	132 (51.4)			 	Master	388 (19)	25 (9.7)			 	Doctor	74 (3.6)	2 (0.8)			 	Marriage			0.255	0.929	 	Single	554 (27.1)	69 (26.8)			 	Married	1454 (71.2)	183 (71.2)			 	Othersb	34 (1.7)	5 (1.9)			 	Fertility			0.341	0.559	 	One or more children	1321 (64.7)	171 (66.5)			 	No child	721 (35.3)	86 (33.5)			 	\nother provinces. b including divorced, separate and widowed\nIn this cross-sectional survey, we retrieved a total of 2423 questionnaires. Of which, 105 questionnaires were excluded for the irrational completion time, and 19 incomplete questionnaires also eliminated. The remaining 2299 questionnaires were completed eligibly, giving an overall response rate of 94.88%. The respondents were comprised of 2042 medical staff (doctors and nurses) and 257 administrative staff (including the logistics). The details of demographic characteristics were presented in Table 1 . Large proportion of female respondents was both found in the medical staff group (77.9%) and the administrative staff group (75.5%). The leading age-band was 31-40 years old, accounting approximately 40% in both groups. Additionally, 70.8% of the participants came from the Eastern of Fujian province. In comparison with the administrative staff group, the medical staff group presented with a higher duration of education (p &lt; 0.001). There was no significant difference in working-age, marriage and fertility status between groups (all p &gt; 0.05).\nComparisons of neuropsychological features\nComparisons of neuropsychological feature between groups. a-c. the proportion of fear, anxiety and depression in each group of subjects.

Moreover, 22.6% of medical staff showed mild to moderate anxiety and 2.9% were severe, the corresponding proportions of administrative staff were 17.1% and 2.9%. The different everity of fear (p &lt; 0.001) and anxiety (p = 0.049) between two groups were significant. In addition, 11.8% of the medical staff presented with mild to moderate depression, and 0.3% with severe depression. As compared to the administrative staff group, there was no significant difference in severity of depression in medical staff group (p = 0.191). We made a further analysis of the factors that facilitate them feeling worried, pressured, or frustrated. As expected, several factors contributed to the expansion of psychological pressure including working in the isolation ward (p &lt; 0.001), worrying about being infected (p &lt; 0.001), shortage of the protective equipment (p &lt; 0.001), the epidemic would never be controlled (p = 0.002), frustrated with unsatisfactory results on work (p &lt; 0.001), and feeling lonely with being isolated from loved (p = 0.005).

Similarly, the levels of HAMA and HAMD were both increased when compared with the administrative staff group (p = 0.015 and p = 0.029, respectively).\nComparison of psychological status based on working department\nComparison of fear, anxiety and depression among different departments.\nTable 4	 	\nVariables	High-risk contact (n = 469)	Low-risk contact (n = 1629)	Non-clinical (n = 201)	P value a	 	Fear scaleb	4.96 +- 2.424	4.81 +- 2.391	4.40 +- 2.356	0.027	 	HAMAc	5.64 +- 7.330	4.44 +- 5.896	3.65 +- 5.071	0.003	 	HAMDd	2.97 +- 4.989	2.24 +- 3.615	1.76 +- 3.107	0.007	 	\nP value for independent samples Kruskal-Wallis H tests. b high-risk contact versus low-risk contact, p = 1.0, high-risk contact versus non-clinical, p = 0.024, low-risk contact versus non-clinical, p = 0.053.\nhigh-risk contact versus low-risk contact, p = 0.026, high-risk contact versus non-clinical, p = 0.005, low-risk contact versus non-clinical, p = 0.279.\nhigh-risk contact versus low-risk contact, p = 0.090, high-risk contact versus non-clinical, p = 0.007, low-risk contact versus non-clinical, p = 0.173.\nMultivariate analysis of fear, anxiety and depression among different departments.\nTable 5	 	\nVariable	HR (95% CI)	P value	 	Multivariate model with the fear scalea			 	Non-clinical	1		 	Low-risk contact	1.301 (0.986 ~ 1.716)	0.063	 	High-risk contact	1.408 (1.025 ~ 1.933)	0.034	 	Multivariate model with the HAMAa			 	Non-clinical	1		 	Low-risk contact	1.306 (0.888 ~ 1.922)	0.175	 	High-risk contact	2.062 (1.349 ~ 3.153)	0.001	 	Multivariate model with the HAMDa			 	Non-clinical	1		 	Low-risk contact	1.394 (0.798 ~ 2.433)	0.243	 	High-risk contact	2.016 (1.102 ~ 3.685)	0.023	 	\nGender, Working years, Native place, Fertility status, Days of working in the isolation ward were included as covariates in ordinal logistic regression model.\nTo provide a better understanding of the results, further research was necessary including engaging in different departments to study the psychological stress, fear, anxiety and depression level. SARS-CoV-2 was a highly contagious respiratory virus and could be transmitted easily by droplets. We further divided all the participants into three subgroups according to the possibility to contact with coronavirus pneumonia patients of their departments: high-risk contact (working in department of respiratory, emergency, ICU and infectious disease), low-risk contact (working in the other clinical departments), and non-clinical (working in administrative, technical operation). As shown in Table 4 , there were significant differences in fear (p = 0.027), anxiety (p = 0.003) and depression (p = 0.007) levels among three subgroups. Additionally, comparisons of three subgroups with each other, the staff working in the departments with high-risk contact with patients exhibited significantly greater fear (p = 0.024), anxiety (p = 0.005) and depression (p = 0.007) than those non-clinical staff, and obviously greater anxiety (p = 0.026) than the low-risk contact staff. In final multivariate analysis (Table 5 ), high-risk contact subgroup staff were 1.4 times as likely to feel fear (OR, 1.408; 95% CI, 1.025 - 1.933), twice as likely to suffer anxiety (OR, 2.062; 95% CI, 1.349 - 3.153) and depression (OR, 2.016; 95% CI, 1.102 - 3.685) than non-clinical subgroup staff.\nDiscussion\nTo our knowledge, the number of studies in this aspect was limited and few had explored the psychological status between medical staff and administrative staff during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. From a data analysis perspective, comparing the average values of fear, anxiety and depression between two groups, medical staff unfolded greater fear, anxiety and depression than administrative staff. The further analysis presented that the medical staff working in those departments close contacted with coronavirus pneumonia patients, such as respiratory department, emergency department, intensive care unit, and infectious diseases department, revealed more psychological disorders, and had almost twice risk for suffering anxiety and depression, compared to the non-clinical staff with hardly possibility to contact with coronavirus pneumonia patients.\nWhat made them uneasy? Be universally known, SARS-CoV-2 highly infectious and spreads rapidly, front line health workers were bearing significantly increased workload. Directly contacting with confirmed patients, the shortage of protective equipment, suspected patients concealing medical history, all of these could increase the risk of being infected for them. Besides, they were afraid of bringing the virus to families and incapability when facing with critical patients. The greater number of these hurdles that they experienced, the greater likelihood that they felt incapable of reaching their aspirations. The resulting strain may then, in turn, be internalized and create anxiety and depression. As we know, after the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan, medical workforce took pains to struggle with disease in the front line and protected health of the public. These specific situations posed considerable stress on them, which might lead to high levels of psychological distress. Our discussion was consistent with studies regarding epidemic of SARS and MERS. The Chinese government has initiated strategies to emphasis the control of transmission, and issued numbers of documents calling for attention to the mental and physical health of medical staff, even offered a series of supports and encouragements, such as provided a place for rest with food and supplies, replenished the protective equipment, medical team reinforcements, and strengthened security forces to maintain the order of medical treatment. Then, for every hospital, it was important to help deal with coping strain and reduce the risk of suffering anxiety and depression of medical staff. Therefore, a human-oriented culture and paying more attention to the mental health of medical staff should be promoted for the future advancement of a hospital in China. In regard to the psychological problems of them, the comprehensive psychological consultation organization had established, even regularly do well on mental health management for medical staff for a long time. For those who suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), we could track the follow-up conditions and order proper treatment.\nWith the global spread of COVID-19, the challenge for many countries who are now dealing with large clusters or community transmission is obvious. Our research can provide support and reference for other countries to implement psychological intervention for medical staff as soon as possible.\nThere still exist several limitations in the present study. One limitation in the present study was that all medical workers were from one general hospital, so caution should be practiced in generalizing the results to all medical staff in China. Secondly, the design limits the cause analysis about psychological strains. Future research will still need to potentially include longitudinal tracking of the factors, and the inclusion of the effect evaluation after therapeutic intervention.\nConclusion\nThe current study found support that the medical staff unfolded greater fear, anxiety and depression than the administrative staff. Moreover, the front line medical staff working in department of respiratory, emergency, ICU and infectious disease, were twice more likely to suffer anxiety and depression than the non-clinical staff with hardly possibility to contact with coronavirus pneumonia patients. Effective strategies toward to improving the mental health should be provided to these individuals.\nDeclaration of Competing Interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest.\nReferences\nBecker, S., Fuchs, X., Schakib-Ekbatan, K., 2020.

Spain","abstract":"The pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, which produces COVID-19 disease, has revealed to political and social circles a series of needs that have not yet been met.\n The workers of the State Security Forces and the Armed Forces have done an extraordinary job to try to alleviate the effects that the pandemic has had on the population and to return stability to the citizenry as much as possible.\n In this context, the following investigation is developed based on two objectives: (PO1) to know the level of anxiety in the face of death in these professionals; (PO2) to determine the predictive variables in the above-mentioned phenomenon.\n Professionals from all over Spain have participated in the study (n = 2079).\n From a quantitative perspective, a questionnaire was developed from the Collet–Lester death anxiety scale.\n The results show a total level of 69.2% in the scale, as well as some higher levels about the fear of death of others (82.1%) and the fear of the process of dying of others (78.2%).\n On the other hand, from the binary logistic regressions, four variables are evidenced that condition the risk of suffering death anxiety: (a) certainty of needing psychological treatment in the future; (b) absence of Individual Protection Equipment (PPE); (c) high levels of Emotional Exhaustion; (d) high levels of depersonalization—these last two come from the Maslach and Jackson Burnout scale.\n These data show a need for training and intervention in the emotional and psychological demands of the professionals of the Armed Forces and State Security Forces, as well as the obligation to develop a continuous dialogue with the institutions they represent to foster the feeling of belonging to them.\n It is essential, regardless of the serious consequences that the virus has caused, to understand the psychosocial and emotional demands of enforcement agents and to improve their occupational health.\n","id":"PMC7660332","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"Cristina","surname":"Lázaro-Pérez","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"José

associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.\n\n Increasing quartile of NLR was statistically significantly associated with secondary outcome.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR is associated with outcomes in unselected critically ill patients.\n\n In patients with sepsis, there was no statistically significant relationship between NLR and mortality.\n\n Further investigation is required to increase understanding of the pathophysiology of this relationship and to validate these findings with data collected prospectively.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article

a major threat to public health1–3.\n Despite intense research efforts, how, when and where new diseases appear are still a source of considerable uncertainty.\n A severe respiratory disease was recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China5.\n This outbreak highlights the ongoing ability of viral spill-over from animals to cause

Severe disease was defined according to published criteria as patient-reported dyspnea, respiratory rate &gt;30 per minute, blood oxygen saturation ?93% on room air, ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen &lt;300 mm Hg, or lung infiltrates &gt;50% within 24–48 hours on chest imaging.\n\n Critical disease was defined as respiratory failure, septic shock, or multiple organ dysfunction or failure.\n\n Women were excluded from the study if they had presumed coronavirus disease 2019, but laboratory testing was negative.\n\n The primary outcome was median duration from hospital admission to discharge.\n\n Secondary outcomes included need for supplemental oxygen, intubation, cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrest, death, and timing of delivery.\n\n The clinical courses are described by the median disease day on which these outcomes occurred after the onset of symptoms.\n\n Treatment and neonatal outcomes are also reported.\n\n\nResults\nOf 64 hospitalized pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019, 44 (69%) had severe disease, and 20 (31%) had critical disease.\n\n The following preexisting comorbidities were observed: 25% had a pulmonary condition, 17% had cardiac disease, and the mean body mass index was 34 kg/m2.\n\n Gestational age was at a mean of 29±6 weeks at symptom onset and a mean of 30±6 weeks at hospital admission, with a median disease day 7 since first symptoms.\n\n Most women (81%) were treated with hydroxychloroquine; 7% of women with severe disease and 65% of women with critical disease received remdesivir.\n\n All women with critical disease received either prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation during their admission.\n\n The median duration of hospital stay was 6 days (6 days [severe group] and 10.5 days [critical group]; P=.\n\n01).\n\n Intubation was usually performed around day 9 on patients who required it, and peak respiratory support for women with severe disease was performed on day 8. In women with critical disease, prone positioning was required in 20% of cases, the rate of acute respiratory distress syndrome was 70%, and reintubation was necessary in 20%.\n\n There was 1 case of maternal cardiac arrest, but there were no cases of cardiomyopathy or maternal death.\n\n Thirty-two of 64 (50%) women with coronavirus disease 2019 in this cohort delivered during their hospitalization (34% [severe group] and 85% [critical group]).\n\n Furthermore, 15 of 17 (88%) pregnant women with critical coronavirus disease 2019 delivered preterm during their disease course, with 16 of 17 (94%) pregnant women giving birth through cesarean delivery; overall, 15 of 20 (75%) women with critical disease delivered preterm.\n\n There were no stillbirths or neonatal deaths or cases of vertical transmission.\n\n\nConclusion\nIn pregnant women with severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019, admission into the hospital typically occurred about 7 days after symptom onset, and the duration of hospitalization was 6 days (6 [severe group] vs 12 [critical group]).\n\n Women with critical disease had a high rate of acute respiratory distress syndrome, and there was 1 case of cardiac arrest, but there were no cases of cardiomyopathy or maternal mortality.\n\n Hospitalization of pregnant women with severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019 resulted in delivery during the clinical course of the disease in 50% of this cohort, usually in the third trimester.\n\n There were no perinatal deaths in this cohort.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7205698","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Inc.","authors":[{"firstname":"Rebecca

death due to COVID-19","abstract":"Background\nDespite 2.5 million infections and 169,000 deaths worldwide (as of April 20, 2020), no maternal deaths and only a few pregnant women afflicted with severe respiratory morbidity have been reported to be related to COVID-19 disease.\n\n Given the disproportionate burden of severe and fatal respiratory disease previously documented among pregnant women following other coronavirus-related outbreaks (SARS-CoV in 2003 and MERS-CoV in 2012) and influenza pandemics over the last century, the absence of reported maternal morbidity and mortality with COVID-19 disease is unexpected.\n\n\nObjective\nTo describe maternal and perinatal outcomes and death in a case series of pregnant women with COVID-19 disease.\n\n\nStudy Design\nWe describe here a multiinstitution adjudicated case series from Iran that includes 9 pregnant women diagnosed with severe COVID-19 disease in their second or third trimester.\n\n All 9 pregnant women received a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction nucleic acid testing.\n\n Outcomes of these women were compared with their familial/household members with contact to the affected patient on or after their symptom onset.\n\n All data were reported at death or after a minimum of 14 days from date of admission with COVID-19 disease.\n\n\nResults\nAmong 9 pregnant women with severe COVID-19 disease, at the time of reporting, 7 of 9 died, 1 of 9 remains critically ill and ventilator dependent, and 1 of 9 recovered after prolonged hospitalization.\n\n We obtained self-verified familial/household cohort data in all 9 cases, and in each and every instance, maternal outcomes were more severe compared with outcomes of other high- and low-risk familial/household members (n=33 members for comparison).\n\n\nConclusion\nWe report herein maternal deaths owing to COVID-19 disease.\n\n Until rigorously collected surveillance data emerge, it is prudent to be aware of the potential for maternal death among pregnant women diagnosed as having COVID-19 disease in their second or third trimester.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7187838","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

Demographics, medical and obstetrical history, and coronavirus disease 2019 encounter data were abstracted from medical records.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 46 pregnant patients with a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection were identified from hospital systems capturing 40% of births in Washington State.\n\n Nearly all pregnant individuals with a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection were symptomatic (93.5%, n=43) and the majority were in their second or third trimester (43.5% [n=20] and 50.0% [n=23], respectively).\n\n Symptoms resolved in a median of 24 days (interquartile range, 13–37).\n\n Notably, 7 women were hospitalized (16%) including 1 admitted to the intensive care unit.\n\n A total of 6 cases (15%) were categorized as severe coronavirus disease 2019 with nearly all patients being either overweight or obese before pregnancy or with asthma or other comorbidities.\n\n Of the 8 deliveries that occurred during the study period, there was 1 preterm birth at 33 weeks’ gestation to improve pulmonary status in a woman with class III obesity, and 1 stillbirth of unknown etiology.\n\n\nConclusion\nSevere coronavirus disease 2019 developed in approximately 15% of pregnant patients and occurred primarily in overweight or obese women with underlying conditions.\n\n Obesity and coronavirus disease 2019 may synergistically increase risk for a medically indicated preterm birth to improve maternal pulmonary status in late pregnancy.\n\n These findings support categorizing pregnant patients as a higher-risk group, particularly those with chronic comorbidities.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7234933","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Inc.","authors":[{"firstname":"Erica

crisis.\n\n The knowledge gained from previous human coronavirus outbreaks suggests that pregnant women and their fetuses are particularly susceptible to poor outcomes.\n\n The objective of this study was to summarize the clinical manifestations and maternal and perinatal outcomes of COVID?19 during pregnancy.\n\n\nMaterial and methods\nWe searched databases for all case reports and series from 12 February to 4 April 2020. Multiple terms and combinations were used including COVID?19, pregnancy, maternal mortality, maternal morbidity, complications, clinical manifestations, neonatal morbidity, intrauterine fetal death, neonatal mortality and SARS?CoV?2. Eligibility criteria included peer?reviewed publications written in English or Chinese and quantitative real?time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or dual fluorescence PCR?confirmed SARS?CoV?2

characterisation and epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and

levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis

novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared

effectiveness of an rVSV-vectored vaccine in preventing Ebola virus disease: final results from the Guinea ring vaccination, open-label, cluster-randomised trial (Ebola Ça Suffit!)","abstract":"Background\nrVSV-ZEBOV is a recombinant, replication competent vesicular stomatitis virus-based candidate vaccine expressing a surface glycoprotein of Zaire Ebolavirus.\n\n We tested the effect of rVSV-ZEBOV in preventing Ebola virus disease in contacts and contacts of contacts of recently confirmed cases in Guinea, west Africa.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did an open-label, cluster-randomised ring vaccination trial (Ebola ça Suffit!) in the communities of Conakry and eight surrounding prefectures in the Basse-Guinée region of Guinea, and in Tomkolili and Bombali in Sierra Leone.\n\n We assessed the efficacy of a single intramuscular dose of rVSV-ZEBOV (2×107 plaque-forming units administered in the deltoid muscle) in the prevention of laboratory confirmed Ebola virus disease.\n\n After confirmation of a case of Ebola virus disease, we definitively enumerated on a list a ring (cluster) of all their contacts and contacts of contacts including named contacts and contacts of contacts who were absent at the time of the trial team visit.\n\n The list was archived, then we randomly assigned clusters (1:1) to either immediate vaccination or delayed vaccination (21 days later) of all eligible individuals (eg, those aged ?18 years and not pregnant, breastfeeding, or severely ill).\n\n An independent statistician generated the assignment sequence using block randomisation with randomly varying blocks, stratified by location (urban vs rural) and size of rings (?20 individuals vs &gt;20 individuals).\n\n Ebola response teams and laboratory workers were unaware of assignments.\n\n After a recommendation by an independent data and safety monitoring board, randomisation was stopped and immediate vaccination was also offered to children aged 6–17 years and all identified rings.\n\n The prespecified primary outcome was a laboratory confirmed case of Ebola virus disease with onset 10 days or more from randomisation.\n\n The primary analysis compared the incidence of Ebola virus disease in eligible and vaccinated individuals assigned to immediate vaccination versus eligible contacts and contacts of contacts assigned to delayed vaccination.\n\n This trial is registered with the Pan African Clinical Trials Registry, number PACTR201503001057193.\nFindings\nIn the randomised part of the trial we identified 4539 contacts and contacts of contacts in 51 clusters randomly assigned to immediate vaccination (of whom 3232 were eligible, 2151 consented, and 2119 were immediately vaccinated) and 4557 contacts and contacts of contacts in 47 clusters randomly assigned to delayed vaccination (of whom 3096 were eligible, 2539 consented, and 2041 were vaccinated 21 days after randomisation).\n\n No cases of Ebola virus disease occurred 10 days or more after randomisation among randomly assigned contacts and contacts of contacts vaccinated in immediate clusters versus 16 cases (7 clusters affected) among all eligible individuals in delayed clusters.\n\n Vaccine efficacy was 100% (95% CI 68·9–100·0, p=0·0045), and the calculated intraclass correlation coefficient was 0·035. Additionally, we defined 19 non-randomised clusters in which we enumerated 2745 contacts and contacts of contacts, 2006 of whom were eligible and 1677 were immediately vaccinated, including 194 children.\n\n The evidence from all 117 clusters showed that no cases of Ebola virus disease occurred 10 days or more after randomisation among all immediately vaccinated contacts and contacts of contacts versus 23 cases (11 clusters affected) among all eligible contacts and contacts of contacts in delayed plus all eligible contacts and contacts of contacts never vaccinated in immediate clusters.\n\n The estimated vaccine efficacy here was 100% (95% CI 79·3–100·0, p=0·0033).\n\n 52% of contacts and contacts of contacts assigned to immediate vaccination and in non-randomised clusters received the vaccine immediately; vaccination protected both vaccinated and unvaccinated people in those clusters.\n\n 5837 individuals in total received the vaccine (5643 adults and 194 children), and all vaccinees were followed up for 84 days.\n\n 3149 (53·9%) of 5837 individuals reported at least one adverse event in the 14 days after vaccination; these were typically mild (87·5% of all 7211 adverse events).\n\n Headache (1832 [25·4%]), fatigue (1361 [18·9%]), and muscle pain (942 [13·1%]) were the most commonly reported adverse events in this period across all age groups.\n\n 80 serious adverse events were identified, of which two were judged to be related to vaccination (one febrile reaction and one anaphylaxis) and one possibly related (influenza-like illness); all three recovered without sequelae.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe results add weight to the interim assessment that rVSV-ZEBOV offers substantial protection against Ebola virus disease, with no cases among vaccinated individuals from day 10 after vaccination in both randomised and non-randomised clusters.\n\n\nFunding\nWHO, UK Wellcome Trust, the UK Government through the Department of International Development,

Stomatitis Virus-Based Ebola Vaccine Is Well-Tolerated and Protects Immunocompromised Nonhuman Primates","abstract":"Ebola virus (EBOV) is a significant human pathogen that presents a public health concern as an emerging/re-emerging virus and as a potential biological weapon.\n Substantial progress has been made over the last decade in developing candidate preventive vaccines that can protect nonhuman primates against EBOV.\n Among these prospects, a vaccine based on recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is particularly robust, as it can also confer protection when administered as a postexposure treatment.\n A concern that has been raised regarding the replication-competent VSV vectors that express EBOV glycoproteins is how these vectors would be tolerated by individuals with altered or compromised immune systems such as patients infected with HIV.\n This is especially important as all EBOV outbreaks to date have occurred in areas of Central and Western Africa with high HIV incidence rates in the population.\n In order to address this concern, we evaluated the safety of the recombinant VSV vector expressing the Zaire ebolavirus glycoprotein (VSV?G/ZEBOVGP) in six rhesus macaques infected with simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV).\n All six animals showed no evidence of illness associated with the VSV?G/ZEBOVGP vaccine, suggesting that this vaccine may be safe in immunocompromised populations.\n While one goal of the study was to evaluate the safety of the candidate vaccine platform, it was also of interest to determine if altered immune status would affect vaccine efficacy.\n The vaccine protected 4 of 6 SHIV-infected macaques from death following ZEBOV challenge.\n Evaluation of CD4+ T cells in all animals showed that the animals that succumbed to lethal ZEBOV challenge had the lowest CD4+ counts, suggesting that CD4+ T cells may play a role in mediating protection against ZEBOV.\n","id":"PMC2582959","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Thomas

2004).\n The Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged in the Arabian Peninsula in 2012 and has caused recurrent outbreaks in humans with a fatality rate of 35%.\n SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are zoonotic viruses that crossed the species barrier using bats/palm civets and dromedary camels, respectively.\n No specific treatments or vaccines have been approved against any of the six human coronaviruses, highlighting the need to investigate the principles governing viral entry and cross-species transmission as well as to prepare for zoonotic outbreaks which are likely to occur due to the large reservoir of CoVs found in mammals and birds.\n Here, we review our understanding of the infection mechanism used by coronaviruses derived from recent structural and biochemical studies.\n","id":"PMC7112261","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Inc.","authors":[{"firstname":"M.

in the treatment of patients infected with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Virus (SARS-CoV) making passive immune therapy with human monoclonal antibodies an attractive treatment strategy for SARS.\n Previously, using Xenomouse (Amgen British Columbia Inc), we produced a panel of neutralizing Human monoclonal antibodies (HmAbs) that could specifically bind to the ectodomain of the SARS-CoV spike (S) glycoprotein.\n Some of the HmAbs were S1 domain specific, while some were not.\n In this study, we describe non-S1 binding neutralizing HmAbs that can specifically bind to the conserved S2 domain of the S protein.\n However, unlike the S1 specific HmAbs, the S2 specific HmAbs can neutralize pseudotyped viruses expressing different S proteins containing receptor binding domain sequences of various clinical isolates.\n These data indicate that HmAbs which bind to conserved regions of the S protein are more suitable for conferring protection against a wide range of SARS-CoV variants and have implications for generating therapeutic antibodies or subunit vaccines against other enveloped viruses.\n","id":"PMC3503966","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

worldwide.\n The production of therapeutic proteins for treating diseases at large scale for millions of individuals is one of the essential needs of mankind.\n Recent progress in the area of recombinant DNA technologies has paved the way to producing recombinant proteins that can be used as therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostic reagents.\n Recombinant proteins for these applications are mainly produced using prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression host systems such as mammalian cells, bacteria, yeast, insect cells, and transgenic plants at laboratory scale as well as in large-scale settings.\n The development of efficient bioprocessing strategies is crucial for industrial production of recombinant proteins of therapeutic and prophylactic importance.\n Recently, advances have been made in the various areas of bioprocessing and are being utilized to develop effective processes for producing recombinant proteins.\n These include the use of high-throughput devices for effective bioprocess optimization and of disposable systems, continuous upstream processing, continuous chromatography, integrated continuous bioprocessing, Quality by Design, and process analytical technologies to achieve quality product with higher yield.\n This review summarizes recent developments in the bioprocessing of recombinant proteins, including in various expression systems,

compared adjuvanted virus-like particles (VLP) with recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), both expressing the Ebola virus antigens.\n The neutralizing antibody titers of rabbits immunized with adjuvanted VLPs were similar to those immunized with the replication-competent VSV, indicating that presentation of the antigen in its native conformation rather than de novo antigen expression is essential for production of functional antibodies.\n This approach also yielded high-titer antisera against Nipah virus glycoproteins, illustrating that it is transferable to other virus families.\n Multiple-step immunoglobulin G purification using a two-step 20–40% ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by protein A affinity chromatography resulted in 90% recovery of functionality and sustained in vivo stability.\n Adjuvanted VLP-based immunization strategies are thus a promising approach for the rapid generation of therapeutic antisera against

318–490, did not detectably bind ACE2. A point mutation at aspartic acid 454 abolished association of the full S1 domain and of the 193-residue fragment with ACE2. The 193-residue fragment blocked S protein-mediated infection with an IC50 of less than 10 nm, whereas the IC50 of the S1 domain was ?50 nm.\n These data identify an independently folded receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV S protein.\n","id":"PMC7982343","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"ASBMB.

Single-Domain Antibodies: Historical Perspective and Future Outlook","abstract":"Tremendous effort has been expended over the past two and a half decades to understand many aspects of camelid heavy chain antibodies, from their biology, evolution, and immunogenetics to their potential applications in various fields of research and medicine.\n In this article, I present a historical perspective on the development of camelid single-domain antibodies (sdAbs or VHHs, also widely known as nanobodies) since their discovery and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of these unique molecules in various areas of research, industry, and medicine.\n Commercialization of camelid sdAbs exploded in 2001 with a flurry of patents issued to the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB) and later taken on by the Vlaams Interuniversitair Instituut voor Biotechnologie (VIB) and, after 2002, the VIB-founded spin-off company, Ablynx.\n While entrepreneurial spirit has certainly catalyzed the exploration of nanobodies as marketable products, IP restrictions may be partially responsible for the relatively long time span between the discovery of these biomolecules and their entry into the pharmaceutical market.\n It is now anticipated that the first VHH-based antibody drug, Caplacizumab, a bivalent anti-vWF antibody for treating rare blood clotting disorders, may be approved and commercialized in 2018 or shortly thereafter.\n This elusive first approval, along with the expiry of key patents, may substantially alter the scientific and biomedical landscape surrounding camelid sdAbs and pave the way for their emergence as mainstream biotherapeutics.\n","id":"PMC5701970","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Frontiers Media

Potently Inhibits MERS-CoV Infection and Induces Strong Neutralizing Antibody Responses: Implication for Developing Therapeutics and Vaccines","abstract":"An emerging respiratory infectious disease with high mortality, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), is caused by a novel coronavirus (MERS-CoV).\n It was first reported in 2012 in Saudi Arabia and has now spread to eight countries.\n Development of effective therapeutics and vaccines is crucial to save lives and halt the spread of MERS-CoV.\n Here, we show that a recombinant protein containing a 212-amino acid fragment (residues 377-588) in the truncated receptor-binding domain (RBD: residues 367–606) of MERS-CoV spike (S) protein fused with human IgG Fc fragment (S377-588-Fc) is highly expressed in the culture supernatant of transfected 293T cells.\n The purified S377-588-Fc protein efficiently binds to dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor of MERS-CoV, and potently inhibited MERS-CoV infection, suggesting its potential to be further developed as a therapeutic modality for treating MERS-CoV infection and saving the patients’ lives.\n The recombinant S377-588-Fc is able to induce in the vaccinated mice strong MERS-CoV S-specific antibodies, which blocks the binding of RBD to DPP4 receptor and effectively neutralizes MERS-CoV infection.\n These findings indicate that this truncated RBD protein shows promise for further development as an effective and safe vaccine for the prevention of MERS-CoV infection.\n","id":"PMC3852489","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

pulmonary-infected SARS coronavirus","abstract":"While the 2002–2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) resulted in 774 deaths, patients who were affected with mild pulmonary symptoms successfully recovered.\n The objective of the present work was to identify, using SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) mouse infection models, immune factors responsible for clearing of the virus.\n The elimination of pulmonary SARS-CoV infection required the activation of B cells by CD4+ T cells.\n Furthermore, passive immunization (post-infection) with homologous (murine) anti-SARS-CoV antiserum showed greater elimination efficacy against SARS-CoV than that with heterologous (rabbit) antiserum, despite the use of equivalent titers of neutralizing antibodies.\n This distinction was mediated by mouse phagocytic cells (monocyte-derived infiltrating macrophages and partially alveolar macrophages, but not neutrophils), as demonstrated both by adoptive transfer from donors and by immunological depletion of selected cell types.\n These results indicate that the cooperation of anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and phagocytic cells plays an important role in the elimination of SARS-CoV.\n","id":"PMC7111974","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

conformational change of the spike, and mediates viral entry into IgG Fc receptor-expressing cells through canonical viral-receptor-dependent pathways.\n We further evaluated how antibody dosages

A novel coronavirus was identified and subsequently named as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization (WHO). More than 84,000 cases were confirmed with COVID-19 in China, conservatively including 3000 doctors and nurses. Frontline medical workers (FMW) are exposed to high chronic stress due to high risk of infection and long work hours. These constant stressors may negatively impact their sleep and mental health.\nMedical workers generally experience high levels of stress, irregular work schedule, and frequent work shifts, which may lead to increased sleep disturbances. In a meta-analysis, Qiu et al., found that 39.2% of Chinese medical workers suffered from sleep disturbances, which indicated the prevalence was much higher than general population. The outbreak of COVID-19 in China remains to be a serious challenge for FMW. They are not only under high risk of being infected with the disease but also high mental stress, which may lead to acute sleep disturbances. Therefore, we conducted a cross-sectional study to evaluate the sleep disturbances, anxiety, and depression of FMW in Hubei Province, and made a comparison with non-FMW. We hypothesized that FMW would report greater sleep disturbances, anxiety, and depression levels than non-FMW.\nMethods\nStudy samples\nThis cross-sectional study included medical workers in Hubei Province, China. The Institutional Review Board of Chinese PLA General Hospital approved this study. All subjects provided informed consent. The survey was conducted anonymously. The inclusion criteria for this study were as follows: (a) age older than 18 years old; (b) medical workers in Hubei Province, including local medical workers and supportive medical workers from other Chinese regions, and (c) volunteered to participate in the survey. The exclusion criteria were listed as follows: (a) history of mental disorders; (b) sleep quality was affected by negative personal events; (c) taking sleep modulating medication (sedatives and hypnotics), and (d) incomplete data of the online questionnaire. Subjects were divided into FMW and non-FMW groups according to whether directly exposed to COVID-19 patients. FMW worked in departments specialized for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, while non-FMW worked in general departments.\nData collection\nThe online survey was conducted in February 2020, with the contents encompassing basic information (age, gender, marriage, education level, etc.), epidemiological investigation, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). PSQI is a self-reported questionnaire which assesses subjective sleep quality within one month. A subject with a total score &gt;6 points is defined as poor sleep quality. The higher the PSQI, the worse the sleep quality. The AIS is a brief instrument to assess the severity of insomnia. It contains eight items with each item rated from 0 to 3 points. A subject with a total score &gt;6 points screens positive for insomnia. The higher the AIS, the more severe the insomnia. In this study, we used the VAS to measure anxiety and depression. Furthermore, the VAS was presented as a horizontal graphic slider, which was divided into 10 segments from 1 (weakest) to 10 (strongest). Higher scores indicate stronger feeling of each mental status.\nStatistical analysis\nCategorical variables were described as percentages, and continuous variables were described as mean +- SDs. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 23.0 for Windows. The scores of PSQI, AIS, and VAS were compared by ANCOVA. The demographic characteristics with significant differences between two groups were described as covariates and joined in the process of ANCOVA. Comparisons of categorical variables were conducted by Chi-square test. P value &lt; 0.05 was considered statistical significance.\nResults\nSubject demographic characteristics\nA total of 1396 medical workers answered the questionnaire. There was no subject excluded due to exclusion criteria A, B, and C, while 90 questionnaires were excluded due to incomplete data. Therefore, 1306 subjects (801 FMW and 505 non-FMW) with age of (33.1 +- 8.4) years old were finally enrolled, comprising 256 (19.6%) males and 1050 (80.4%) females. There were 161 (20.1%) males and 640 (79.9%) females in FMW, while there were 95 (18.8%) males and 410 females (81.2%) in non-FMW. There were 534 (66.7%) subjects married in FMW, whereas there were 359 (71.1%) subjects married in non-FMW. Significant differences of age ([32.4 +- 7.7] vs [34.1 +- 9.3]; P = 0.016), education level (P = 0.002), and rank (P = 0.001) were found between FMW and non-FMW.\nComparison of scores and prevalence\nComparison of PSQI, AIS, VAS, and sleep disturbances prevalence.\nTable 1	 	\n	Overall (n = 1306)	FMW (n = 801)	Non-FMW (n = 505)	Effect size	P value	 	Scores				Cohen's d		 	 PSQI	8.6 +- 3.9	9.3 +- 3.8	7.5 +- 3.7	0.47	&lt;0.001	 	 AIS	6.3 +- 4.2	6.9 +- 4.3	5.3 +- 3.8	0.38	&lt;0.001	 	 Anxiety VAS	4.7 +- 2.7	4.9 +- 2.7	4.3 +- 2.6	0.22	&lt;0.001	 	 Depression VAS	3.9 +- 2.4	4.1 +- 2.5	3.6 +- 2.4	0.21	0.001	 	Prevalence				RR		 	 PSQI&gt;6	936 (71.7%)	628 (78.4%)	308 (61.0%)	1.29	&lt;0.001	 	 AIS&gt;6	594 (45.5%)	414 (51.7%)	180 (35.6%)	1.45	&lt;0.001	 	\nFMW = frontline medical workers, PSQI= Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, AIS = Athens Insomnia Scale, VAS= Visual Analogue Scale, RR = relative risk.\nThe boxplots for PSQI, AIS, Anxiety and Depression VAS scores of FMW and non-FMW (A) The FMW had significantly higher scores of PSQI (P &lt; 0.001) than non-FMW.

FMW = frontline medical workers, PSQI= Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, AIS = Athens Insomnia Scale, VAS= Visual Analogue Scale.\nFig. 1\nThe scores of PSQI, AIS, and VAS are presented in Table 1 . Compared to non-FMW, FMW had significantly higher scores of PSQI (9.3 +- 3.8 vs 7.5 +- 3.7; P &lt; 0.001; Cohen's d = 0.47), AIS (6.9 +- 4.3 vs 5.3 +- 3.8; P &lt; 0.001; Cohen's d = 0.38), anxiety (4.9 +- 2.7 vs 4.3 +- 2.6; P &lt; 0.001; Cohen's d = 0.22), and depression (4.1 +- 2.5 vs 3.6 +- 2.4; P = 0.001; Cohen's d = 0.21) (Fig. 1 ).\nOverall, 936 (71.7%) subjects had poor sleep quality according to PSQI&gt; 6 points, while 594 (45.5%) subjects had insomnia according to AIS&gt; 6 points. There were 628 (78.4%) FMW and 308 (61.0%) non-FMW with PSQI&gt; 6 points. Meanwhile, AIS &gt;6 points were observed in 414 (51.7%) FMW and 180 (35.6%) non-FMW. Compared to non-FMW, FMW had significantly higher prevalence of sleep disturbances, according to PSQI &gt;6 points (78.4% vs 61.0%; P &lt; 0.001) and AIS &gt; 6 points (51.7% vs 35.6%; P &lt; 0.001). FMW were 29% more likely to endorse poor sleep quality relative to non-FMW (relative risk [RR]: 1.29), and had 45% increased risk of insomnia (RR: 1.45) (Table 1). Additionally, there were 670 (83.6%) FMW and 353 (69.9%) non-FMW with PSQI&gt; 5 points, and 538 (67.2%) FMW and 241 (47.7%) non-FMW with PSQI &gt; 7 points. In subgroup analysis, 516 (80.6%) female FMW and 112 (69.6%) male FMW had PSQI &gt; 6 points. Compared to male FMW, female FMW had significantly higher prevalence of sleep disturbances (80.6% vs 69.6%; P = 0.002) according to PSQI&gt;6 points.\nDiscussion\nThe rapid spread of the disease and inadequate early realization toward COVID-19 challenged the health institutions in many countries. In addition, the mortality of COVID-19 was 2.3%, and medical workers accounted for 3.8% of confirmed cases as reported by the latest epidemiological study. Previous studies have indicated medical workers were vulnerable to sleep disturbances in ordinary times. Therefore, we hypothesized that FMW under the outbreak of COVID-19 may be more susceptible to sleep disturbances. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the sleep disturbances of FMW under the outbreak of COVID-19.\nThe pooled prevalence of sleep disturbances for Chinese healthcare professionals is 39.2%. In comparison, the present study demonstrated that medical workers under COVID-19 outbreak suffered from elevated sleep disturbances, especially for FMW. Our study showed that 78.4% of FMW had poor sleep quality and 51.7% of them had insomnia. The high prevalence of sleep disturbances for FMW should be put much emphasize, since sleep disturbances influence not only medical workers' health but also their professional performance. The study also demonstrated FMW had significantly higher prevalence of sleep disturbances than non-FMW. Change of work environment may underpin the more severe sleep disturbances of FMW. With the direct contact with COVID-19 patients, FMW are inclined to emerge anxiety and worries of being infected. The rapid spread of COVID-19 boomed the medical demands, aggravated the shortage of medical resources, and increased work stress for FMW, especially for those with continuous work and frequent day-night shifts. By comparison, non-FMW work in a relatively mild environment and have less possibility of being infected, thus having fewer sleep disturbances. Our study also found female FMW had worse sleep quality than male FMW. Zhang et al., calculated a hazard ratio of 1.41 for female versus male toward insomnia. In general, females have inferior symptom bearing and greater bodily vigilance, which potentially exaggerates the severity and prevalence of sleep disturbances.\nThe study has several limitations that should be noted. First, this is a cross-sectional study. All subjects volunteered to participate in the survey, so there may be subject selection bias. Second, we did not measure COVID-19 exposure, infection, or attitudes in subjects, which could influence sleep quality. Third, our questionnaires did not contain sufficient items to explore the potential risk factors for sleep disturbances. Finally, our study lacked of follow-ups, which may show the following changes of sleep disturbances for FMW.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, FMW have higher prevalence of sleep disturbances and worse sleep quality than non-FMW. And female FMW report more sleep disturbances than male FMW. Further interventions should be administrated for FMW, aiming to maintain their healthy condition and guarantee their professional performance in the battle against COVID-19.\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n Jing Qi: Conceptualization, Investigation, Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology, Software, Writing - original draft.
