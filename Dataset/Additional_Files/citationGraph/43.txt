We found that the mortality rate in the IV group was 92%, compared to the other two groups (6.4% in the NV group, 40.8% in the NIV group). Furthermore, patients in the IV group developed a higher rate of severe comorbidities such as acute kidney injury (AKI) which required continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) (26.5%) compared to the NV (2.9%) and NIV (5.3%) groups. Moreover, 10 patients (8.8%) in the IV group received ECMO implementation. \nThe mean age in the IV group was 71, which was significantly higher than the other two groups (67 in both the NIV group and NV group, P = 0.03). There were no significant differences in comorbidities on admission except chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Interestingly, there were even more cases of COPD in the NIV group (31, 20.7%) than in the IV group (8, 7.1%). This could be explained that physicians tend to avoid intubation in chronic lung disease patients due to concern of barotrauma and higher DNR/DNI ratio in those patients. From laboratory results, significantly higher white blood cell count, lower lymphocyte count and platelet count, and higher CRP, AST, ALT, and total bilirubin are presented in the IV group than the other two groups on admission. SOFA scores in the IV and NIV groups were also significantly higher than the NV group. There were no significant differences in Scr among these groups on admission though. We can tell from the data that the patients in the IV group were older with a higher rate of hyperinflammation status on admission compared to the other two groups. These factors may lead to the rapid progress of respiratory failure and fatal outcome eventually.\nResearchers worldwide also start to realize that IV may not improve the mortality in COVID-19 patients. We have to admit that some of the COVID-19 patients who developed progressive worsening respiratory distress were refractory to NIV. Intubation is inevitable in those cases. However, sometimes physicians can be rushed to intubation. It has been reported that intubation can be successfully avoided by HFNO.\nAs we all know, IV can cause a lot of complications including hypotension, ventilator-related infection, volume imbalance, and sedation-related delirium. The decision of intubation mostly based on clinical judgments and varies from case to case. There is a notion that NIV causes wide-spread dispersion of aerosol thus increases the risk of transmission to healthcare workers. This could be one of the reasons that encourages physicians to choose IV over NIV among clinical decisions.\nIn conclusion, from our data in Wuhan, COVID-19 patients who were invasively ventilated exhibited pessimistic outcomes. This suggests that early intubation may not help patients but instead, make things head towards the wrong direction. We should try to avoid IV and utilize NIV at the early stage of respiratory failure until IV is inevitable. It is time for physicians to rethink the threshold of intubation in COVID-19 management.\nAbbreviations\nCovid-19\nCoronavirus disease 2019\nNV\nNo ventilation (nasal cannula oxygen)\nNIV\nNoninvasive ventilation (BiPAP, CPAP, or high-flow nasal oxygen)\nIV\nInvasive ventilation\nHFNO\nHigh-flow nasal oxygen\nPublisher's Note\nSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.\nJing Hua, Chenchen Qian and Zhibing Luo contributed equally to this work.\nAuthors' contributions\nJing Hua and Zhibing Luo contributed to the collection and analysis of the clinical data.

No hospital-related transmission was observed.\nINTRODUCTION\nBeginning in December 2019, cases of pneumonia with new coronavirus infection began to appear in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. Since then, the number of infected cases has increased exponentially. World Health Organization (WHO) has officially named the new coronavirus that caused the outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan as &quot;coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19)&quot;.\nOn December 8, 2019, the first patient was diagnosed in Wuhan Central Hospital with a history of exposure to the South China Seafood Market. In the following Spring Festival travel rush, COVID-19 spread rapidly in Hubei province, China and even the rest of the world. Five million people left Wuhan before the festival, 65 percent of whom returned to home in Hubei Province and 35 percent scattered throughout the country.\nAs the nearest metropolis to Wuhan, Changsha city (335 km in distance) has faced great pressure after the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan. Hunan Province is the second largest destination in China for the 5 million people who left from Wuhan. It is estimated that approximately 0.3 million Wuhan people migrate to Changsha before the festival. Fortunately, Changsha has abundant medical resources, including three affiliated Xiangya Hospitals of Central South University, three affiliated hospitals of Hunan University of Traditional Chinese Medicines, five provincial hospitals and five city hospitals. As of February 14, 2020, a total of 238 COVID-19 cases have been confirmed in Changsha, and all of them were isolated and treated in the north hospital of the First Hospital of Changsha City. Of these, 66 cases have met the discharge criterion after intensive treatment as of February 14, 2020. The number of admitted cases ranks 7th and the number of discharged cases ranks 8th in the country.\nAs for the death rate, Wuhan has the highest death rate to date at 3.52%. Besides the death rates in Hong Kong, Heilongjiang province, Hainan province and Tianjin City at 2.98%, 2.52%, 2.38% and 2.29%, the death rate of most provinces is less than 2%. Therefore, we believe that the imported COVID-19 is a curable and controllable disease with effective treatment. The efficacy of clinical treatment is remarkable. In this study, we summarized the treatment strategy and outcome of the 238 COVID-19 cases admitted in Changsha.\nRESULTS\nPatients' characteristics at admission\nThis study included 238 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19. The median age was 45 years (IQR: 34-59; range: 1-84). 117 (48.7%) were males. 110 (46.2%) were office workers, 33 (13.9%) were retired people, 12 (5.0%) were students or a teacher (only 1), 3 (1.3%) were medical workers (not infected at work site), 16 (6.8%) were freelance workers/ self-employed / sales, 6 (2.5%) were farmer / cooker / train attendant, and the other 57 (24.1%) had no job designation. 104 (43.7%) had a recent history of visiting Wuhan, and their median duration from leaving Wuhan to diagnosis was 10 days (IQR: 7-14). 139 (58.4%) had a history of getting in touch with Wuhan people. 113 (47.5%) had a history of getting in touch with diagnosed patients. 90 (37.8%) had infected family members.\nAmong these patients, 190 (79.8%) were the mild or general type and were admitted to isolation wards. 48 (20.2%) patients were of severe or critical type and were transferred to the ICU. Among these 48 patients, 21 (43.8%) were mild or general at admission, but then progressed to severe pneumonia and transferred to the ICU within a median of 4 days (IQR, 2-5 days). The median durations from the onset of symptoms to diagnosis and hospital admission were 4 days (IQR: 2-7) and 5 days (IQR: 3-8), respectively (Table 1). Among the 238 patients, 93 (39.1%) had one or more coexisting comorbidities. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (36 [15.1%]), diabetes (15 [6.3%]), chronic hepatobiliary disease (15 [6.3%]), heart disease (HD) (including 8 coronary HD) (11 [4.6%]), and pulmonary disease (including 1 COPD) (10 [4.2%]). The most common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (159 [66.8%]), cough (137 [57.6%]), fatigue (65 [27.3%]), expectoration (49 [20.6%]). Less common symptoms were pharyngalgia, anorexia, chest tightness / pain, chills, dyspnea, myalgia and diarrhea (from 15.5% to 8.4%) (Table 1).\nPatient characters.\n	Total (n=238)	Clinical Classification	*P value	 	Mild / General (n=190)	Severe / Critical (n=48)	 	Age, median (IQR), yr	45 (+-17), 45 (34, 59)	43 (+-17), 41 (31-54)	54 (+-15), 54 (44, 66)	&lt;.001	 	Sex, No (%),					 	Female	122 (51.3)	101 (53.2)	21 (43.8)	0.24	 	Male	117 (48.7)	89 (46.8)	27 (56.3)	 	Occupations, No (%),					 	Office workers	110 (46.2)	89 (47.1)	21 (43.8)	0.70	 	Retired	33 (13.9)	20 (10.6)	13 (27.1)	0.003	 	Student (1 teacher)	12 (5.0)	12 (6.3)	0 (0)	0.06	 	Medical Worker	3 (1.3)	3 (1.6)	0 (0)	0.50	 	Freelance Worker/ Self-employed /Sales	16 (6.8)	13 (6.9)	3 (6.3)	&gt;.99	 	Farmer / Cooker / Train Attendant	6 (2.5)	4 (2.1)	2 (4.2)	0.35	 	None	57 (24.1)	48 (25.3)	9 (18.8)	0.34	 	Wuhan visit, No (%),	104 (43.7)	76 (40.2)	28 (59.6)	0.02	 	Left Wuhan to diagnosis, median (IQR), d	10 (7, 14)	10 (7, 15)	8 (7, 12)	0.29	 	Wuhan people touch, No (%),	139 (58.4)	104 (55.0)	35 (74.5)	0.02	 	Patient touch, No (%),	113 (47.5)	98 (51.6)	15 (31.9)	0.02	 	Family members infected, No (%),	90 (37.8)	77 (40.5)	13 (27.1)	0.09	 	Comorbidities, No (%),					 	Hypertension	36 (15.1)	21 (11.1)	14 (29.2)	0.002	 	Chronic hepatobiliary disease	15 (6.3)	11 (5.8)	4 (8.3)	0.51	 	Diabetes	15 (6.3)	10 (5.3)	5 (10.4)	0.19	 	Heart disease (HD) (8 Coronary HD)	11 (4.6)	4 (2.1)	7 (14.6)	0.002	 	Pulmonary diseases (1 COPD)	10 (4.2)	8 (4.2)	2 (4.2)	&gt;.99	 	Cerebrovascular disease	8 (3.4)	5 (2.6)	3 (6.3)	0.20	 	Bone disease	8 (3.4)	6 (3.2)	2 (4.2)	0.66	 	Gastric disease	7 (2.9)	6 (3.2)	1 (2.1)	&gt;.99	 	Gynecological (breast) disease (1 pregnancy)	7 (2.9)	5 (2.6)	2 (4.2)	0.63	 	Chronic kidney disease	4 (1.7)	1 (0.5)	3 (6.3)	0.03	 	Endocrine	3 (1.3)	1 (0.5)	2 (4.2)	0.10	 	Blood disease	2 (0.8)	1 (0.5)	1 (2.1)	0.36	 	Malignancy	2 (0.8)	2 (1.1)	0 (0)	&gt;.99	 	Sign and symptoms, No (%),					 	Fever	159 (66.8)	114 (60.0)	45 (93.8)	&lt;.0001	 	Cough	137 (57.6)	106 (55.8)	31 (64.6)	0.27	 	Fatigue	65 (27.3)	44 (23.2)	21 (43.8)	0.004	 	Expectoration	49 (20.6)	36 (19.0)	13 (27.1)	0.21	 	Pharyngalgia	37 (15.5)	33 (17.4)	3 (6.3)	0.07	 	Anorexia	28 (11.8)	20 (10.5)	8 (16.7)	0.24	 	Chest tightness / pain	23 (9.7)	18 (9.5)	5 (10.4)	0.84	 	Chilly	22 (9.2)	14 (7.4)	8 (16.7)	0.05	 	Dyspnea	20 (8.4)	9 (4.7)	11 (22.9)	&lt;.0001	 	Myalgia	20 (8.4)	13 (6.8)	7 (14.6)	0.08	 	Diarrhea	20 (8.4)	13 (6.8)	7 (14.6)	0.08	 	Headache	11 (4.6)	6 (3.2)	5 (10.4)	0.03	 	Dizziness	9 (3.8)	7 (3.7)	2 (4.2)	&gt;.99	 	Vomiting	8 (3.4)	7 (3.7)	1 (2.1)	&gt;.99	 	Nasal discharge	6 (2.5)	6 (3.2)	0 (0)	0.60	 	Nasal obstruction	6 (2.5)	5 (2.6)	1 (2.1)	&gt;.99	 	Onset of symptom to, median (IQR), d					 	Diagnosis	4 (2, 7)	4 (2, 7)	4 (3, 8)	0.15	 	Hospital admission	5 (3, 8)	5 (3, 8)	5 (3, 9)	0.22	 	Arterial pressure difference, median (IQR), mm Hg	48 (43-54)	47 (43, 54)	49 (44, 54)	0.40	 	\nAbbreviations: COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; IQR, interquartile range; HD, heart disease.\n* P values indicate differences between mild / general type and severe / critical patients. P &lt; .05 was considered statistically significant.\nCompared with mild or general patients, the severe or critical patients were significantly older (median age, 54 years [IQR, 44-66] vs 41 years [IQR, 31-54]; P&lt;.001) and more likely to have coexisting comorbidities, such as hypertension (14 [29.2%] vs 21 [11.1%]; P=0.002), heart disease (HD) (7 [14.6%] vs 4 [2.1%]; P=0.002), and chronic kidney disease (3 [6.3%] vs 1 [0.5%]; P=0.03). Compared to mild or general patients, the severe or critical patients were more likely to report fever, fatigue, chills, dyspnea, and headache. In addition, compared to mild or general patients, more severe or critical patients tended to have visited Wuhan (28 [59.6%] vs 76 [40.2%]; P=0.02) and to have gotten in touch with Wuhan people (35 [74.5%] vs 104 [55.0%]; P=0.02), but tended to be less likely to be infected by patients (15 [31.9%] vs 98 [51.6%]; P=0.02) and family members (13 [27.1%] vs 77 [40.5%]; P=0.09). These findings suggested the primary Wuhan infection might be more serious than the secondary infection from patients or family members.\nTemperature, image and laboratory indexes\nAt admission, more severe or critical patients tended to have high fever. The arterial pressure difference (APD) and vital signs (heart rate and respiratory rate (RR)) did not differ between mild / general patients and severe / critical patients. 16 mild patients had no obvious abnormal chest CT image. 144 (60.5%) patients showed bilateral involvement in a chest scan. In laboratory findings, severe / critical patients had significantly lower lymphocyte count and higher platelet count (Table 2). All severe patients had PaO2 / FiO2 &lt; 300 mmHg or the oxygen saturation &lt; 93% or the appearance of respiratory distress RR &gt; 30 /min. All critical patients had respiration failure (invasive mechanical ventilation support) or shock or with failure of other organs.\nTemperature, image and laboratory findings of NCIP patients at admission.\n	Normal range	Total (n=238)	Clinical classification	*P value	 	Mild / General (n=190)	Severe / Critical (n=48)	 	Temperature						 	Low fever (37.3 C -38.0 C)	36.3 C-37.2 C	42 (17.6)	24 (12.6)	18 (37.5)	&lt;.001	 	Medium fever (38.1 C -39.0 C)		12 (5.0)	8 (4.2)	4 (8.3)	0.27	 	High fever (above 39.0 C)		3 (1.3)	0 (0)	3 (6.3)	0.01	 	CT image						 	Normal		6 (2.5)	6 (3.2)	0 (0)	0.60	 	Single lung involvement		88 (37.0)	73 (38.4)	15 (31.3)	0.36	 	Bilateral involvement		144 (60.5)	111 (58.4)	33 (68.7)	0.19	 	Laboratory findings						 	White blood cell count, x109/L	3.5-9.5	4.6 (3.5, 5.7)	4.7 (3.6, 5.7)	4.5 (2.9, 5.6)	0.06	 	Neutrophil count, x109/L	1.8-6.3	2.9 (2.1, 3.7)	2.9 (2.1, 3.6)	3.0 (2.0, 3.8)	0.44	 	Lymphocyte count, x109/L	1.1-3.2	1.1 (0.8, 1.6)	1.2 (0.9, 1.7)	0.7 (0.5, 1.4)	&lt;.001	 	Eosinophil count, x109/L	0.05-0.50	0.01 (0, 0.05)	0.02 (0.01, 0.06)	0 (0, 0.01)	0.10	 	Platelet count, x109/L	125-350	139 (111, 172)	178.5 (145.5, 235)	150 (130, 189)	0.03	 	Hemoglobin, g/L	110-160	130 (120, 141)	129 (120, 141)	130 (119, 143)	0.99	 	\nAbbreviations: CT, computed tomography.\n* P values indicate differences between mild / general type and severe / critical patients.

The most common antiviral therapy was Lopinavir / Ritonavir alone (70 [29.3%]), Interferon (35 [14.7%]) and their combination (97 [40.8%]). Compared to mild or general patients, less severe or critical patients received Lopinavir / Ritonavir (6 [12.5%] vs 64 [33.7%]; P=0.004) and Interferon plus Lopinavir / Ritonavir (5 [10.4%] vs 92 [48.4%]; P&lt;0.001). Some patients received Arbidol (16 [6.7%]), Xuebijing (TCM) (17 [7.1%]) and Chloroquine phosphate (3 [1.3%]). More severe or critical patients received Xuebijing (7 [14.6%] vs 10 [5.3%]; P=0.03, Table 3). As for the immunosuppressive therapy, 100% severe and critical patients received Glucocorticoid and Gamma-globulin treatment. 28 (14.7%) and 27 (14.2%) mild or general patients received Glucocorticoid and Gamma-globulin treatment, respectively. In addition, all severe and critical patients received pure oxygen inhalation. Four patients received mechanic ventilation support and one patient was treated with ECMO. Two of these four patients died, including the one with ECMO (Table 3).\nTreatment of COVID-19 patients.\n	Total (n=238)	Clinical classification	*P value	 	Mild / General (n=190)	Severe / Critical (n=48)	 	Complications, No. (%)	15 (6.3)	3 (1.6)	12 (25.0)	&lt;.001	 	Antiviral therapy, No. (%)					 	Lopinavir/Ritonavir alone	70 (29.3)	64 (33.7)	6 (12.5)	0.004	 	Lopinavir/Ritonavir + Interferon (analogues)	97 (40.8)	92 (48.4)	5 (10.4)	&lt;.001	 	Interferon (analogues)	35 (14.7)	32 (16.8)	3 (6.25)	0.06	 	Arbidol alone	16 (6.7)	11 (5.8)	5 (10.4)	0.33	 	Arbidol + Interferon (analogues)	11 (4.6)	11 (5.8)	0 (0)	0.13	 	Xuebijing (TCM)	17 (7.1)	10 (5.3)	7 (14.6)	0.03	 	Chloroquine phosphate	3 (1.3)	3 (1.6)	0 (0)	&gt;.99	 	Immunosuppressive therapy, No. (%)					 	Glucocorticoid therapy	76 (31.9)	28 (14.7)	48 (100)	&lt;.001	 	Gamma-globulin therapy	75 (31.5)	27 (14.2)	48 (100)	&lt;.001	 	Respiratory support, No. (%)					 	Oxygen inhalation	48 (20.2)	0 (0)	48 (100)	&lt;.001	 	Mechanic ventilation	4 (1.7)	0 (0)	4 (8.3)	0.002	 	ECMO	1 (0.4)	0 (0)	1 (2.1)	0.20	 	\nAbbreviations: TCM, traditional Chinese medicine; ECMO, extracorporeal membrane lung oxygenation.\n* P values indicate differences between mild / general type and severe / critical patients.

Among all these 48 severe or critical patients, 39 (81.3%) severe or critical patients converted to mild or general type after treatment,, at a median of 9 days (IQR, 6-12) after admission. 8 (16.7%) severe patients progressed to critical at a median of 7.5 days (IQR, 2.5-10) after admission, and six of them became better after intensive care and treatment. Two critical patients died. One 64-year Wuhan male died at 16 days after admission, 23 days after he left from Wuhan; one 58-year Changsha male died at 25 days after admission, 34 days after he left from Wuhan.\nThe discharge rate was almost the same between mild / general patients and severe / critical patients (130 [68.4%] vs 31 [64.6%]; P=0.49). Among those discharged, the duration from admission to discharge was 13 days (IQR, 10-16). Compared to patients with mild or general type, discharged patients who presented with severe or critical type had longer median length of hospital stay (LOH) (12 [IQR, 10-16] days vs 15 [IQR, 12-20]; P=0.006) (Table 4). Apart from two dead patients, the Kaplan-Merrier (KM) curve showed the 10-, 14-, 20- and 28-day discharge rate was 19.1%, 42.8%, 65.0% and 76.4%, respectively (Figure 1 and Supplementary Table 1). The 10-, 14-, 20- and 28-day discharge rate for mild / general patients and severe / critical patients were 21.6%, 45.8%, 67.1%, 75.0% and 8.7%, 30.4%, 56.1%, 77.6%, respectively (Logrank P=0.19, Figure 2 and Supplementary Table 2).\nKaplan-Meier curve of the hospital probabilities (still in hospitalization without discharge) for all 236 alive hospitalized COVID-19 patients.\nKaplan-Meier curve of the hospital probabilities (still in hospitalization without discharge) for alive hospitalized COVID-19 patients stratified by clinical classifications (mild / general and severe / critical).\nTreatment outcome as for February 28, 2020.\n	Total (n=238)	Clinical classification	*P value	 	Mild / General (n=190)	Severe / Critical (n=48)	 	Outcome, No. (%)					 	Discharge	169 (71)	130 (68.4)	31 (64.6)	0.49	 	Change to mild/general type	39 (16.4)	0 (0)	39 (81.3)	&lt;.001	 	Severe change to critical type	8 (3.4)	0 (0)	8 (16.7)	&lt;.001	 	Death	2 (0.8)	0 (0)	2 (4.2)	0.04	 	Duration from admission to, median (IQR), d				 	Discharge (LOH)	13 (10, 16)	12 (10, 16)	15 (12, 20)	0.006	 	Change to mild/general type	9 (6, 12)	-	9 (6, 12)	-	 	Change to critical type	7.5 (2.5, 10)	-	7.5 (2.5, 10)	-	 	Death, d			20.5 (16, 25)		 	\nAbbreviations: LOH, length of hospitalization.\n* P values indicate differences between mild / general type and severe / critical patients. P &lt; .05 was considered statistically significant.\nThe effect of different characteristics on the outcome (discharge)\nAs for the discharge, the discharge rate is almost the same between severe / critical type and mild / general type. But LOH was significantly longer in severe / critical type. When the discharge is served as an outcome, we performed COX regression analyses to evaluate the effect of antiviral drugs on discharge. Table 5 listed the analysis results of antiviral treatment. Hazard ratio (HR) values indicated the ratio of hazards of discharge among the patients with diverse antiviral therapy compared to the hazards of discharge among the patients with reference Lopinavir/Ritonavir alone treatment. Here, the higher HR is, the more likely to discharge from hospital compared to Lopinavir/ Ritonavir alone treatment. So, Arbitol plus Interferon treatment is significant beneficial for discharge than Lopinavir/Ritonavir alone treatment in total patients (HR (95% CI) = 2.50 (1.07, 5.83), P=0.03). In mild / general patients, Arbitol alone treatment also showed significant beneficial for discharge than Lopinavir/Ritonavir alone treatment (HR (95% CI) = 2.13 (1.08, 4.20), P=0.03). For severe/critical patients, Xuebijing is more beneficial for discharge (HR (95% CI) = 40.99 (2.50, 670.88), P=0.01).\nThe impact of different drug management on the prognosis of mild/general and severe/critical patients.\nCandidate variables	Total (n=238)	Subgroups	 	Mild / General (n=190)		Severe / Critical (n=48)	 	*HR (95% CI)	P value	HR (95% CI)		P value		HR (95% CI)	P value	 	Antiviral therapy,									 	Lopinavir/Ritonavir alone	Ref			Ref			Ref		 	Lopinavir/Ritonavir + Interferon (analogues)	1.31 (0.89, 1.93)	0.17		1.29 (0.83, 2.00)	0.25		0.55 (0.07, 4.12)	0.56	 	Interferon (analogues)	0.95 (0.55, 1.64)	0.85		0.82 (0.45, 1.50)	0.52		3.35 (0.72, 15.65)	0.12	 	Arbidol alone	1.44 (0.75, 2.75)	0.27		2.13 (1.08, 4.20)	0.03		4.18 (0.51, 34.28)	0.18	 	Arbidol + Interferon (analogues)	2.50 (1.07, 5.83)	0.03		2.29 (0.89, 5.84)	0.08		-	-	 	Xuebijing (TCM)	1.51 (0.47, 4.83)	0.49		0.99 (0.24, 4.11)	0.99		40.99 (2.50, 670.88)	0.01	 	Chloroquine phosphate	0.42 (0.06, 3.07)	0.40		0.40 (0.06, 2.92)	0.37		-	-	 	\nAbbreviations: TCM, traditional Chinese medicine, HR, hazard ratio; CI, confidence interval.\n*HR values indicated the ratio of hazards of discharge among the patients with diverse antiviral therapy compared to the hazards of discharge among the patients with reference Lopinavir/Ritonavir alone treatment.\nIn addition, the effects of other clinical characteristics (such as comorbidities and laboratory indexes) on discharge were summarized in Table 6. Most comorbidies seemed to be protective against discharge, but their effects were not significant. Gynecological disease was beneficial for discharge (HR=2.27, P=0.05), but such an effect was unreliable due to minimal sample size (only 7 patients had gynecological disease, Table 1). As for the laboratory indexes, none of them significantly affect the discharge (Table 6).\nThe impact of characteristics on prognosis (discharge).\nCandidate variables	*HR (95% CI)	P value	 	Age	1.00 (0.99, 1.00)	0.32	 	Gender			 	Female	Ref		 	Male	1.14 (0.84, 1.56)	0.41	 	Type			 	Mild / general	Ref		 	Severe / critical	0.78 (0.53, 1.15)	0.21	 	Comorbidities			 	Hypertension	0.94 (0.61, 1.44)	0.78	 	Chronic hepatobiliary disease	0.94 (0.48, 1.84)	0.86	 	Diabetes	0.96 (0.49, 1.87)	0.89	 	Heart disease (HD) (8 Coronary HD)	0.90 (0.42, 1.92)	0.78	 	Pulmonary diseases (1 COPD)	0.83 (0.34, 2.03)	0.69	 	Cerebrovascular disease	2.10 (0.98, 4.49)	0.06	 	Bone disease	0.89 (0.39, 2.01)	0.77	 	Gastric disease	0.63 (0.23, 1.72)	0.36	 	Gynecological (breast) disease (1 pregnancy)	2.27 (1.00, 5.15)	0.05	 	Other	1.12 (0.52, 2.38)	0.78	 	#Laboratory Indexes			 	White blood cell count	1.09 (0.94, 1.27)	0.24	 	Neutrophil count	1.04 (0.89, 1.22)	0.59	 	Lymphocyte count	1.07 (0.95, 1.22)	0.27	 	Eosinophil count	1.03 (0.91, 1.17)	0.60	 	Platelet count	1.07 (0.91, 1.25)	0.44	 	Hemoglobin	0.92 (0.79, 1.06)	0.24	 	\nAbbreviations: HR, hazard ratio; CI, confidence interval.\n*HR values indicated the ratio of hazards of discharge among the patients with diverse antiviral therapy compared to the hazards of discharge among the patients with reference Lopinavir/Ritonavir alone treatment.\nFor #Laboratory Indexes, HR (95% CI) was calculated by using the hazards of discharge at 1 standard deviation (SD) increase of the laboratory indexes compared to the hazards of discharge at baseline laboratory indexes.\nDISCUSSION\nIn this study, we summarized the clinical characteristics and treatment outcome of 236 COVID-19 patients who were diagnosed before February 14 in Changsha city. About 20% patients were severe and critical type. Two patients died due to the severe disease. The 10-, 14-, 20- and 28-day discharge rate was 19.1%, 42.8%, 65.0% and 76.4%, respectively. The 10-, 14-, 20- and 28-day discharge rate for mild / general patients and severe / critical patients were 21.6%, 45.8%, 67.1%, 75.0% and 8.7%, 30.4%, 56.1%, 77.6%, respectively.\nCompared to patients with mild or general type, discharged patients who presented with severe or critical type had longer median length of hospital stay (LOH) (12 [IQR, 10-16] days vs 15 [IQR, 12-20]; P=0.006). In addition, severe / critical patients were older, more likely to visit Wuhan, get in touch with Wuhan people. Mild / general patients were more likely to be infected by patients and family members. Severe/critical patients were more likely to have comorbidities, such as hypertension, heart disease and chronic kidney disease. Severe/critical patients were more likely to have symptoms, such as fever, fatigue, dyspnea, etc. Moreover, severe / critical patients had lower lymphocyte and platelet counts. TCM Xuebijing were used more frequently in severe / critical patients and this drug showed significant benefit in severe / critical patients.\nThe coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) spreads rapidly and has obvious family aggregation. Currently, there are no specific antiviral drugs to kill the virus (treatment guideline). Comprehensive management and active symptomatic treatment are the main treatment strategies. As COVID-19 is a respiratory infectious disease with strong transmission, we need high personal protection requirements for doctors and nurses. Comprehensive strategies have played important roles in decreasing the mortality rate and preventing the infection of medical workers. Here, we summarized three main strategies, including the treatment strategy, infection control strategy, and safeguard strategy.\nThe first one is the treatment strategy\n1.1 For mild patients, doctor in charge assessed patient's condition daily according to the patient's symptoms, vital signs and oxygen saturation. Patients who had no fever at 3-5 days after hospitalization received coronavirus nucleic acid tests and CT scan for doctors to detect disease changes. As shown in Table 1, 160 (67.2%) cases reported having fever before hospitalization, but the majority of patients had no fever after admission. As shown in Table 2, only 58 (24.3%) patient had fever and most of them (42 [72.4%]) were low-fever (37.3-38.0  C).\nAmong 94 patients who had no fever after admission, 16 patients were found obvious glass-like changes in bilateral lungs by CT scan at three days later post-admission. That was a sign for disease exacerbation from mild to severe. At that moment, the addition of pure oxygen inhalation, low-dose glucocorticoid and short-term gamma-globulin therapy was necessary. By above treatment, 15 patients turned back to mild, 10 of whom turned to mild in 2-6 days; the rest 5 patients turned to mild in 15-20 days. However, one patient became worsen to critical. With active treatment, he had turned back to severe type and still stayed in hospital. Due to the CT finding at early stage, we could detect the changes in lung and perform active treatment as early as possible, which effectively shortened the duration of patients in severe condition. For patients who had unilateral glass-grinding change by CT scan at 3 days post-admission, oxygen inhalation and active symptomatic treatment were given to timely prevent the transition of mild disease to severe disease. For patients who were negative in coronavirus nucleic acid test after antiviral therapy for long time, we collected their blood serum and stem cells at the recovery stage. As for February 27, the accumulative number of discharge patients was 161. The cure rate was 67.6%. The average length of hospital stay was 12.5 days. Among cities which had accumulative confirmed COVID-19 patients of more than 200 cases, Changsha's discharge rate ranks 5th.\n1.2 For severe and critical patients, their condition changed rapidly and they had more basic diseases. Therefore, the treatment was more difficult than mild patients. In this case, we centralized our medical recourses, experts, drugs and patients. All severe and critical patients were admitted in two ICU wards, and all medical professionals experienced in intensive medicine were concentrated in these two wards. We adopted the 'one-person-one-team' strategy to secure every severe or critical patient to have his/her own team of doctor and nurse. Every day, the team leader must report all the patient' situation to the senior doctors, including the vital signs, blood gas analysis results, changes in biochemical indexes and clinical symptoms, and airway management, etc. For patient who poorly responded to treatment, the onsite senior doctors need to provide alternative effective options as soon as possible. For patients who had basic diseases or complications, senior specialists would give their corresponding treatment advice. For patients who might became severe or critical according to image and laboratory alert, a group of senior experts would be invited through remote consultation system for next treatment regimen. Our senior experts were from three Xiangya affiliated hospitals, Hunan University of traditional Chinese Medicine, and Hunan Institute of traditional Chinese Medicine, etc.\n1.3 As for the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), more than 90% cases received TCM treatment. TCM experts differentiated symptoms and exerted treatment for patients daily. We found that COVID-19 in Changsha area had some regularity in TCM pathogenesis, which belonged to the 'warm heat' type of epidemic disease. On the whole, it could be treated according to TCM 'warm' epidemic disease; but there was also a great degree of variability, especially for patients with basic disease, old patients, and severe / critical patients. The TCM syndrome type of COVID-19 was closely related to its basic constitution, which accorded with the theory that &quot;the external evil is moving, the recipient is hard to know; patient being aware once having symptoms, then disease could be distinguished &quot;. From the real-world observation, among COVID-19 patient with mild and general type, TCM syndrome types 'warm evil attacked defense system', 'warm dryness injured saliva', and 'little sun stagnated heat' were common, and each syndrome type was also always coupled with 'dampness evil (or turbid poison)'. For severe patients, common TCM syndrome types were 'gas-water deficiency', 'evil heat blocked lung', and 'heat phlegm accumulated in lung'. For critical patients, the syndrome type and performance were 'extreme gas-water deficiency', 'internal closed with external collapsed'.\n1.4 Nutrition support and early rehabilitation training were important for critical patients. Nasal jejuna nutrition-feeding tube could effectively reduce the risk of reflux and aspiration, and improve the tolerance of patients to enteral nutrition (EN). Early rehabilitation training has pretty high potency ratio, because it could reduce the mortality of severe patients and shorten the length of hospital stay and length of ventilator use. But critical patients were not able to rehabilitate actively, so medical staff need to intervene proactively. COVID-19 patients, especially the severe patients, can achieve good outcome by early lung rehabilitation. Early lung rehabilitation (ELR) is good for sputum drainage and functional exercise of diaphragm; ELR can prevent thrombosis, re-infection and other complications; it is also conducive to control pneumonia, prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia, reduce the risk of deep venous thrombosis, and improve mental health and life quality.\n1.5 Psychological care is particularly important in severe patients and those with positive viral nucleic acid for long time. On the one hand, they are concerned that the disease cannot be effectively controlled; on the other hand, they are concerned about the medication-caused side effects and sequelae after discharge. Most of these patients are highly educated and are more stressed than the average, so psychological care is particularly important. The measures we take are to send them daily greeting messages to relieve their psychological stress, eliminate their fear and improve their compliance with medication.\n2. The second strategy is the infection control strategy. We have taken the following measures to prevent infection of medical workers:\n2.1. We strictly set up individual 'three zones' (contaminated zone, potential contaminated zone, and clean zone) and 'two channels' (medical personnel passage and patient passage). All items must be passed through the transfer window, which is sterilized by ultraviolet light.\n2.2 We setup dressing mirror for workers to check protective cloth by themselves. We also have full-time supervisor to double check the guard suite. In the clothes taking-off room, the clothes taking-off process is printed out on the wall, and surveillance cameras monitor the taking-off process. Medical workers who are going to leave the contaminated zone should be taken out in pairs for mutual supervision. Medical workers must bathe and change clothes before leaving the ward. Then, they stay in a designated hotel to rest.\n2.3 Sufficient rest time and psychological care are necessary for medical workers. All medical staffs work 4 to 6 hours per shift. Anyone who has physical discomfort must leave the isolation ward and take a rest at the designated hotel. There are 'three not-allowed': 1) sick personnel is not allowed to work in isolation ward, 2) fatigue ones are not allowed to work, 3) workers without correct dressing are not allowed to work. Professional psychological counselors carry on psychological counseling for medical workers in designated hospital to relieve their panic mental.\n2.4 To ensure the personal protection of medical workers who take care of patients during transporting, all patient-transporting vehicles are negative pressure ambulances.\n3. The third one is the material support strategy. As shown in Figure 3, we have a strong material support system, including the net-work support system. To ensure the treating capacity of 300 patients, we renovated three floors in two buildings and opened eight nursing unit within 6 days immediately after Spring Festival. All the patients in Changsha area are timely admitted and treated in our hospital. All related departments, including the Finance Bureau, Health Commission, Residential and Construction Bureau, Environmental Protection Department, Gas Provider, Bureau of Governmental Affairs, CDC, etc, have made their best to contribute and ensure the hospitalization of all infected patients and zero-hospital infection of medical staff. In short period after COVID-19 outbreak, we selected and trained 600 medical staffs from the public hospitals throughout the city. We arranged them to work in isolation ward by stages and in groups. We also purchased all the protective materials and medical equipment in emergency, including ECMO, broncho-fiberscope, mobile CT, etc. We requisitioned three hotels for medical staffs to take a rest, and two hotels to centralize the discharged patients for isolation and clinical observation. To secure enough rest for medical staffs, nine buses are responsible for the daily shifting, according to the medical staffs' working time schedule. Bureau of Environmental Protection and CDC are in charge of properly dealing with the medical sewage and trash. The gas, electricity, water and telecom providers ensure the sufficient resource supply. Governmental Affair Bureau guarantees the daily diet and nutrition of all medical staffs and patients. During the entire medical treatment process, it is precisely because of such a safeguard support system, we have no worries, and we spend all our time and energy on how to rescue, treat and care patients, how to do a good job for personal protection and prevent infection for workers. We make our best to control mild patients not to become severe, severe patients not to become critical, and critical patients not to die.\nOrganization structure of COVID-19 defense and control system.\nAs of February 27, 2020, two patients have died. One 64-year old male patient died on February 15, 2020. This patient had hypertension, COPD and smoking history. Multilobular infiltration, lymphopenia and bacterial co-infection occurred during disease progression. This patient had all six indexed in the MuLBSTA score, which is effective in predicting mortality in viral pneumonia. Another 58-year old male patient died on February 21, 2020. This patient left Wuhan on January 14, 2020, and was diagnosed and admitted on January 23, 2020. At admission, this patient had lung infiltration by CT scan, belonging to general type. On January 31, 2020, the disease progressed rapidly and critically. After 16-days of treatment, with invasive ventilation CRRT and even ECMO, this patient died on February 17, 2020.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nStudy design and participants\nThis study was approved by the institutional ethics board of the First Hospital of Changsha city (No. KL-2020002). All consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19, who were admitted to the north hospital of First Hospital of Changsha city from January 22 to February 14, 2020, were enrolled. Signed consent was obtained from patients. The First Hospital of Changsha city is the teaching hospital of Central South University and Nanhua University. Its north hospital was established in response to SARS in 2003. Currently, the north hospital of the First hospital of Changsha city is the only designated hospital responsible for the treatments for all COVID-19 patients throughout Changsha city. All COVID-19 patients were diagnosed according to WHO interim guidance. All COVID-19 patients admitted in the north hospital were treated in accordance with the national COVID-19 treatment guidance (Trial Edition 2). Consistent with the published Wuhan study, the treatment outcomes were discharge, mortality, and length of hospital stay (LOH). All patients were followed up until February 27, 2020.\nDiagnostic criteria\nSuspected cases were diagnosed according to the clinical manifestations combined with the following epidemiological histories: 1) travel history or residence history in the community of Wuhan and its surrounding areas within 14 days prior to onset of the disease; 2) contact history with COVID-19 (RT-PCR 2019-nCoV positive) patient within 14 days before onset; 3) contact with people who had fever or respiratory symptoms and migrated from Wuhan and the surrounding areas or from the community where COVID-19 cases have been reported, and contact with people who had fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days prior to onset of the disease; (4) cases with cluster disease. The clinical manifestations included: 1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; 2) imaging features of coronavirus pneumonia; 3) the total number of white blood cells (WBC) was abnormal or decreased, or the count of lymphocytes was reduced. Patients with any one of the epidemiological history combined with any 2 of the clinical manifestations, or patients without a clear epidemiological history but having all three clinical manifestations, were diagnosed as the suspected patients.\nConfirmed cases were suspected cases with one of the following pieces of etiological evidence: 1) detection of 2019-nCoV positive by real-time fluorescence RT-PCR in respiratory or blood samples; 2) Sequencing of the virus genes in respiratory or blood samples, highly homologous to the known 2019-nCoV.\nDischarge criterion and follow-up procedure\nIn clinical practice, the discharge time for all patients was 1-2 days after 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test changed to negative. As for the image criterions, 1) for severe patients without underlying disease, the discharge time was after CT scan showed that the pneumonia lesion was almost absorbed; 2) for general patients, the lung lesion should be totally absorbed before discharge. All discharged patients should be followed up with every 5 days for 30 days after discharge. All discharged patients should be self-isolated at home for the first 14 days after discharge. A psychologist was responsible for contacting the discharged patients to relieve their stress.\nData collection\nFor all patients, the basic demographics, medical history and epidemiological information, including age, gender, occupation, disease history, living place (province, city, district, etc), Wuhan visit history, disease exposure history, family exposure history, were collected at admission. We recorded the pre-admission influenza-like illness (ILI) symptoms (fever, cough, pharyngitis, diarrhea, etc) at admission. After admission, we recorded all the examination and treatment information, including the physical examination findings, laboratory and image findings, complications, symptoms, pharmaceutical applications, respiration support, etc. All data were collected by the medical records office. All patients' medical records were analyzed by a group of professional statistical analysts from Central South University, Emory University and ICF.\nClinical classifications\nAccording to the clinical features, COVID-19 patients were categorized into mild, general, severe and critical type. Mild patients only showed slight fever and mild fatigue without pneumonia CT change. The general patient had fever, respiratory symptoms, and a CT scan detecting featured pneumonia change. Severe patients often had dyspnea and/or hypoxemia within one week after the onset of the disease, and severe patients quickly progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulation dysfunction. The severe disease was identified once any of the following criteria was met: 1) respiration distress (respiration rate &gt; 30 / min); 2) at rest, the oxygen saturation &lt; 93%; 3) the partial pressure of arterial blood oxygen (PaO2) / Fraction of inspiration O2 (FiO2) &lt; 300mmHg. The critical disease was identified once any of the following criteria was met: 1) Respiratory failure and patient needed the mechanical ventilation; 2) the appearance of shock; 3) ICU monitoring was required for the combination of other organ failure. It is worth noting that the severe and critical patients in the course of the disease could be with slight fever, or even no obvious fever 10.\nStatistical analysis\nContinuous variables were summarized in terms of the median (interquartile range). Categorical variables were described via frequencies and percentages. Independent group t-tests were used to compare continuous variables where data were approximately normally distributed; otherwise, the Mann-Whitney test was used. Mixed linear models were used for repeated records. Chi-square tests were used to compare the proportions for categorical variables; Fisher's exact test was adopted for limited subgroups. Cox regression analysis was used to evaluate the univariate and multivariate risk of candidate gene mutations in progression. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the survival distributions against progression, and the log-rank test was used to assess differences in PSF experience among subgroups. All tests of hypotheses were two-tailed and conducted at a significance level of 0.05. Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS 9.4.\nSupplementary Material\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS: Y.X., ZY.H., Y.W. and X.W. analyzed the data.

pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on

(MERS)-CoV, have raised great public health concern globally.\n\n Here, we report a novel bat-origin CoV causing severe and fatal pneumonia in humans.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected clinical data and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens from five patients with severe pneumonia from Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, Hubei province, China.\n\n Nucleic acids of the BAL were extracted and subjected to next-generation sequencing.\n\n Virus isolation was carried out, and maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees were constructed.\n\n\nResults\nFive patients hospitalized from December 18 to December 29, 2019 presented with fever, cough, and dyspnea accompanied by complications of acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n Chest radiography revealed diffuse opacities and consolidation.\n\n One of these patients died.\n\n Sequence results revealed the presence of a previously unknown ?-CoV strain in all five patients, with 99.8% to 99.9% nucleotide identities among the isolates.\n\n These isolates showed 79.0% nucleotide identity with the sequence of SARS-CoV (GenBank NC_004718) and 51.8% identity with the sequence of MERS-CoV (GenBank NC_019843).\n\n The virus is phylogenetically closest to a bat SARS-like CoV (SL-ZC45, GenBank MG772933) with 87.6% to 87.7% nucleotide identity, but is in a separate clade.\n\n Moreover, these viruses have a single intact open reading frame gene 8, as a further indicator of bat-origin CoVs.\n\n However, the amino acid sequence of the tentative receptor-binding domain resembles that of SARS-CoV, indicating that these viruses might use the same receptor.\n\n\nConclusion\nA novel bat-borne CoV was identified that is associated with severe and fatal respiratory disease in

patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension

associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile

virus detection.\n\n\nMethods\nWe compared seven published real-time RT–PCR assays and two new assays that we have developed.\n\n To determine the analytical sensitivity of each assay, we constructed a synthetic universal control ribonucleic acid (uncRNA) containing all of the assays’ target regions on one RNA strand and spiked human blood or urine with known quantities of African or Asian Zika virus strains.\n\n Viral loads in 33 samples from Zika virus-infected patients were determined by using one of the new assays.\n\n\nFindings\nOligonucleotides of the published real-time RT–PCR assays, showed up to 10 potential mismatches with the Asian lineage causing the current outbreak, compared with 0 to 4 mismatches for the new assays.\n\n The 95% lower detection limit of the seven most sensitive assays ranged from 2.1 to 12.1 uncRNA copies/reaction.\n\n Two assays had lower sensitivities of 17.0 and 1373.3 uncRNA copies/reaction and showed a similar sensitivity when using spiked samples.\n\n The mean viral loads in samples from Zika virus-infected patients were 5?×?104 RNA copies/mL of blood and 2?×?104 RNA copies/mL of urine.\n\n\nConclusion\nWe provide reagents and updated protocols for Zika virus detection suitable for the current outbreak strains.\n\n Some published assays might be unsuitable for Zika virus detection, due to the limited sensitivity and potential incompatibility with some strains.\n\n Viral concentrations in the clinical samples were close to the technical detection limit, suggesting that the use of insensitive assays will cause false-negative

severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) during its emergence in humans.\n In spite of intense study, it remains unclear whether the deletion actually reflects adaptation to humans.\n Here we engineered full, partially deleted (?29?nt), and fully deleted ORF8 into a SARS-CoV infectious cDNA clone, strain Frankfurt-1. Replication of the resulting viruses was compared in primate cell cultures as well as Rhinolophus bat cells made permissive for SARS-CoV replication by lentiviral transduction of the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor.\n Cells from cotton rat, goat, and sheep provided control scenarios that represent host systems in which SARS-CoV is neither endemic nor epidemic.\n Independent of the cell system, the truncation of ORF8 (29?nt deletion) decreased replication up to 23-fold.\n The effect was independent of the type I interferon response.\n The 29?nt deletion in SARS-CoV is a deleterious mutation acquired along the initial human-to-human transmission chain.\n The resulting loss of fitness may be due to a founder effect, which has rarely been documented in processes of viral emergence.\n These results have important implications for the retrospective assessment of the threat posed by

important insights into the natural history of past human pandemics.\n For two of these viruses, we have strong evidence suggesting an origin in major livestock species while primordial associations for all four viruses may have existed with bats and rodents.\n HCoV-NL63 and -229E may originate from bat reservoirs as assumed for many other coronaviruses, but HCoV-OC43 and -HKU1 seem more likely to have speciated from rodent-associated viruses.\n HCoV-OC43 is thought to have emerged from ancestors in domestic animals such as cattle or swine.\n The bovine coronavirus has been suggested to be a possible ancestor, from which HCoV-OC43 may have emerged in the context of a pandemic recorded historically at the end of the 19th century.\n New data suggest that HCoV-229E may actually be

local scale.\n\n Here we evaluate the performances of high-volume electronic medical claims data to assess local and regional influenza activity.\n\n\nMaterial and Methods\nWe used electronic medical claims data compiled by IMS Health in 480 US locations to create weekly regional influenza-like-illness (ILI) time series during 2003–2010. IMS Health captured 62% of US outpatient visits in 2009. We studied the performances of IMS-ILI indicators against reference influenza surveillance datasets, including CDC-ILI outpatient and laboratory-confirmed influenza data.\n\n We estimated correlation in weekly incidences, peak timing and seasonal intensity across datasets, stratified by 10 regions and four age groups (&lt;5, 5–29, 30–59, and 60+ years).\n\n To test IMS-Health performances at the city level, we compared IMS-ILI indicators to syndromic surveillance data for New York City.\n\n We also used control data on laboratory-confirmed Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) activity to test the specificity of IMS-ILI for influenza surveillance.\n\n\nResults\nRegional IMS-ILI indicators were highly synchronous with CDC's reference influenza surveillance data (Pearson correlation coefficients rho?0.89; range across regions, 0.80–0.97, P&lt;0.001).\n\n Seasonal intensity estimates were weakly correlated across datasets in all age data (rho?0.52), moderately correlated among adults (rho?0.64) and uncorrelated among school-age children.\n\n IMS-ILI indicators were more correlated with reference influenza data than control RSV indicators (rho?=?0.93 with influenza v.\n\n rho?=?0.33 with RSV, P&lt;0.05).\n\n City-level IMS-ILI indicators were highly consistent with reference syndromic data (rho?0.86).\n\n\nConclusion\nMedical claims-based ILI indicators accurately capture weekly fluctuations in influenza activity in all US regions during inter-pandemic and pandemic seasons, and can be broken down by age groups and fine geographical areas.\n\n Medical claims data provide more reliable and fine-grained indicators of influenza activity than other high-volume electronic algorithms and should be used to augment existing influenza surveillance systems.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4114744","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Cécile","surname":"Viboud","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Vivek","surname":"Charu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Donald","surname":"Olson","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sébastien","surname":"Ballesteros","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Julia","surname":"Gog","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Farid","surname":"Khan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Bryan","surname":"Grenfell","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lone","surname":"Simonsen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Edward","surname":"Goldstein","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Edward","surname":"Goldstein","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Seasonal and pandemic influenza surveillance considerations for constructing multicomponent systems","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"CDC website.

clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data.\n\n Outcomes were followed up until Jan 25, 2020.\nFindings\nOf the 99 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, 49 (49%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market.\n\n The average age of the patients was 55·5 years (SD 13·1), including 67 men and 32 women.\n\n 2019-nCoV was detected in all patients by real-time RT-PCR.\n\n 50 (51%) patients had chronic diseases.\n\n Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (82 [83%] patients), cough (81 [82%] patients), shortness of breath (31 [31%] patients), muscle ache (11 [11%] patients), confusion (nine [9%] patients), headache (eight [8%] patients), sore throat (five [5%] patients), rhinorrhoea (four [4%] patients), chest pain (two [2%] patients), diarrhoea (two [2%] patients), and nausea and vomiting (one [1%] patient).\n\n According to imaging examination, 74 (75%) patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 14 (14%) patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity, and one (1%) patient had pneumothorax.\n\n 17 (17%) patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and, among them, 11 (11%) patients worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection was of clustering onset, is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n In general, characteristics of patients who died were in line with the MuLBSTA score, an early warning model for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia.\n\n Further investigation is needed to explore the applicability of the MuLBSTA score in predicting the risk of mortality in 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key R&amp;D Program of China.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7135076","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future

Earlier publications worldwide demonstrate higher mortality among patients receiving mechanical ventilation in intensive care units during &quot;surges&quot; in the number of cases. In contrast, lower mortality outcomes are evident in Japan using CRISIS [CRoss Icu Searchable Information System] data by the national registry, Japan ECMOnet for COVID-19. This highlights the need for scientific analysis of the medical factors contributing to high survival rates and social factors associated with low case &quot;surges,&quot; to gain insight into protective strategies for possible coming waves in the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a novel challenge for critical care systems worldwide. Appropriate critical care delivery for acute respiratory failure is a cornerstone in saving the lives of patients. A recent publication of JAMA reports a large-scale observational study describing the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 in the New York City area. Among patients who were discharged or who died (n = 2634), 373 (14%) were treated in the intensive care unit (ICU), and 320 (12%) received invasive mechanical ventilation. Surprisingly, 88% of patients died while receiving mechanical ventilation. Similarly, results from a national registry in the UK indicate that 62% of patients with confirmed COVID-19 and requiring advanced respiratory support in the ICU (2175/3508) died. Moreover, a report from the Lombardy region of Italy reported that among 1591 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 admitted to ICUs, 26% died, 16% were discharged, and 58% were still in the ICU. These high mortality rates could be partly explained by overwhelmed ICU services owing to exponential surges in the number of cases of COVID-19.\nCumulative cases daily captured using CRISIS [CRoss Icu Searchable Information System] by the national registry, Japan ECMOnet for COVID-19. Blue bars, survived and weaned off; black bars, died; red bars, remained on ventilator. Y-axis, number of cases; X-axis, dates in the year 2020\nJapan experienced its first wave of patients with COVID-19 beginning in late March, which reached its peak in late April. However, the total number of patients at the peak in Japan was relatively small. On April 27, a maximum of 10,211 patients were treated in a single day nationwide, and a total of 407 patients (4%) nationwide were receiving or had received mechanical ventilation (captured using CRISIS [CRoss Icu Searchable Information System] by the national registry, Japan ECMOnet for COVID-19) (Fig. 1). These totals accounted for about one-third of the critical care beds available specifically for COVID-19 care. Interestingly, 288 patients (60%) were weaned from the ventilator and survived, 79 died, and 114 were still receiving mechanical ventilation on May 16, 2020 (3 weeks after the peak, Fig. 1); the expected mortality rates were between 16 and 48%, calculated by assuming all patients remaining on a ventilator will survive or die. Moreover, veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was performed in 159 patients up to May 16. Of these, 92 patients were weaned from ECMO, 33 died, and 34 continued to receive ECMO, with expected mortality between 20 and 42%. \nAlthough all the aforementioned studies are preliminary reports, that is, a considerable number of patients were still in the ICU on a ventilator, a relatively low mortality outcome is expected in the Japanese results. This suggests that reducing a &quot;surge&quot; in cases, which can overwhelm the capacity of the ICU, is critical for maintaining ordinary ICU functions, avoiding life-and-death triage decisions, and ultimately, saving the lives of patients in the face of this novel threat. More detailed scientific analysis and careful explanation of the data will be needed, considering the indications; patient background including age, comorbidities, or acute illness severity; and details of ventilator management, all factors that can considerably affect survival outcomes. In addition, analyses of the social factors contributing to flattening of the peak itself are urgently required as such findings could offer important insight into nationwide protective strategies against possible &quot;next waves&quot; of the COVID-19 pandemic in countries worldwide.\nAbbreviations\nCOVID-19\nCoronavirus disease 2019\nCRISIS\nCRoss Icu Searchable Information System\nECMO\nExtracorporeal membrane oxygenation\nICU\nIntensive care unit\nSARS-CoV-2\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\nPublisher's Note\nSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.\nAuthor's contributions\nN.

Here, we first studied the dynamics profile of SARS-CoV-2 from 56 recovered patients with COVID-19. We found viral shedding occurred up to 6 weeks after onset of symptoms. A prolonged observation period is necessary for older patients.\n (.) \nTo date, an outbreak of infectious diseases:coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2):continues in Wuhan, China, and threatens countries such as Korea, Italy, Iraq, and Japan, and others. Over 50 countries are fighting against the disease. As of 4 March 2020, more than 85 000 cases were diagnosed worldwide with a death rate of approximately 2%.\nBefore this study, some studies reported cases of viral detection by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at different timepoints throughout the disease course. However, these reports monitored SARS-CoV-2 in the acute phase of infection. Currently, no study has reported the viral dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a long observation period. Understanding the profile of virus in patients' respiratory specimens can assist diagnosis and reflect the disease course. Therefore, we collected clinical specimens from 56 patients with COVID-19 and report the results of SARS-CoV-2 detection during the disease course.\nMETHODS\nA total of 56 hospitalized patients (admission date from 21 January to 12 February 2020) with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in 3 branches (Hankou, Sino-French New City, and Optical Valley) of Tongji Hospital at Tongji Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China, were included in this study. All enrolled patients had a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 according to the diagnosis and treatment guidelines for SARS-CoV-2 from the Chinese National Health Committee (version 5) and the interim guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Throat-swab samples or deep-nasal-cavity-swab samples were collected from patients on different dates after the onset of symptoms. SARS-CoV-2 was detected by real-time RT-PCR assay using a COVID-19 nucleic acid detection kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Shanghai Huirui Biotechnology Co, Ltd). Specifically, 2 target genes, including open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) and nucleocapsid protein (N), were tested during the real-time RT-PCR assay. If 2 consecutive negative results were achieved, the period between symptom onset and the date of the first negative RT-PCR test result was defined as the viral nucleic acid conversion time. All data (test dates and results of RT-PCR assay) were collected up to the final follow-up date (3 March 2020).\nRESULTS\nA total of 56 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were included in this study. According to the guideline, all included patients had mild to moderate disease. No patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). The median age was 55 years (interquartile range [IQR], 42-68; range, 25-83 years), comprising 34 (60.7%) men and 22 (39.3%) women. At the end of follow-up, all patients recovered and were discharged from the hospital.\nThe total number of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assays from 56 patients was 299, with 5 tests per patient. The longest duration between RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 was 42 days after the onset of symptoms. The median duration between the onset of symptoms to nucleic acid conversion was 24 days (IQR, 18-31 days). Details on demographic characteristics and RT-PCR test results are shown in Supplementary Table 1.\nThe number of positive and negative results of RT-PCR tests are shown in Figure 1A. In first 3 weeks after symptoms onset, majority results of RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 were positive. From week 3 after symptom onset, the number of negative RT-PCR results increased. All RT-PCR test results were negative at week 6 after onset (Supplementary Table 2). The positive rate of RT-PCR test results was highest at week 1 (100%), followed by 89.3%, 66.1%, 32.1%, 5.4%, and 0% at weeks 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, respectively (Figure 1B).\nDynamic profile of RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2.

As shown in Supplementary Table 3, patients with prolonged viral shedding tended to be older (P = .011) and were more likely to have comorbidities such as diabetes (P = .016) and hypertension (P = .006).\nDISCUSSION\nThis study is the first case series from 56 patients with COVID-19 with 299 samples of RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Our preliminary results are notable for providing evidence of an SARS-CoV-2 dynamic profile in infected patients.\nGenomic studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 shares approximately 80% identity sequencing with SARS-CoV, which caused a global epidemic with 8096 confirmed cases worldwide in 2002-2003. Presumed person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was suggested based on epidemiologic and clinical evidence. Although SARS-CoV-2 shares similar sequencing characteristics with SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), study of case series suggested that the viral nucleic acid shedding pattern of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 is different from that of SARS-CoV, which had modest viral loads in the early stage and peaked approximately 10 days after symptom onset.\nOur study collected serial RT-PCR test results from 56 patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and investigated the dynamic profile during the disease course. We showed that the majority of patients had positive results on RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 within 3 weeks after the onset of symptoms. The negative results on RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 began to be dominant from week 4 after the onset of symptoms, and by the end of follow-up (6 weeks) all results of RT-PCR tests were negative. The positive rate of RT-PCR test results kept declining during the observation period (6 weeks) (Figure 1). The above findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 viral replication has a relatively long period in infected patients.\nOur study attempted to explore the correlation between clinical characteristics and viral shedding in patients with COVID-19. We found that patients with prolonged viral nucleic acid conversion tended to be older and have more comorbidities. Previous studies suggested that coronavirus is more likely to infect older individuals, in whom the immunopathogenesis and induction of a proinflammatory cytokine storm might be responsible. Older patients with impaired immune function might have a prolonged period of viral elimination.\nAs a result of errors in sampling and testing, false-negative results on RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 are very common in clinical settings. Meanwhile, it is recommended by the current diagnosis and treatment guidelines for SARS-CoV-2 from the Chinese National Health Committee that the criteria for discharging a patient include the relief of symptoms, improvement in radiography, and 2 consecutive negative RT-PCR results for SARS-CoV-2. In our study we found 2 consecutive negative RT-PCR test results followed by a positive result in 4 patients (patient numbers 20, 24, 37, and 56) (Supplementary Table 1). A recent report by Lan et al found positive RT-PCR test results in cases of patients who had recovered from COVID-19. These infected patients could be the source of transmission. The above findings question the current criteria of discharge.\nEvidence suggested that the outbreaks of COVID-19 may be correlated to its rapid person-to-person transmission ability. Since specific treatment has not been validated for COVID-19, traditional public health tactics:isolation, quarantine, and community containment:are critical to control the spread . This preliminary study has found evidence of the dynamic profile of SARS-CoV-2 in non-ICU patients with COVID-19 during the disease course. According to the results in our study, we suggest prolonged observation and repeat confirmation of RT-PCR tests from respiratory specimens for safe discharge and discontinuation of quarantine.\nSupplementary Data\nSupplementary materials are available at Clinical Infectious Diseases online.

evaluated by cell inoculation.\n\n SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected using three different RT-PCR kits and multiplex PCR with nanopore sequencing.\n\n\nFindings\nAmong 619 discharged COVID-19 cases, 87 re-tested as SARS-CoV-2 positive in circumstances of social isolation.\n\n All re-positive cases had mild or moderate symptoms at initial diagnosis and were younger on average (median, 28).\n\n Re-positive cases (n = 59) exhibited similar neutralization antibodies (NAbs) titre distributions to other COVID-19 cases (n = 218) tested here.\n\n No infectious strain could be obtained by culture and no full-length viral genomes could be sequenced from re-positive cases.\n\n\nInterpretation\nRe-positive SARS-CoV-2 cases do not appear to be caused by active reinfection and were identified in ~14% of discharged cases.\n\n A robust NAb response and potential virus genome degradation were detected in almost all re-positive cases, suggesting a substantially lower transmission risk, especially through respiratory routes.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7444471","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier","authors":[{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Lu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jinju","surname":"Peng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qianling","surname":"Xiong","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhe","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Huifang","surname":"Lin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiaohua","surname":"Tan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Min","surname":"Kang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Runyu","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lilian","surname":"Zeng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pingping","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chumin","surname":"Liang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lina","surname":"Yi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Louis","surname":"du

severity and active viral load, and to characterize the dynamics of active SARS-CoV-2 clearance in a series of archival samples taken from patients in the first wave of COVID-19 infection in the South West of the UK.\n\n\nMethods\nSubgenomic RNA (sgRNA) and E-gene genomic sequences were measured in a retrospective collection of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2-positive samples from 176 individuals, and related to disease severity.\n\n Viral clearance dynamics were then assessed in relation to symptom onset and last positive test.\n\n\nResults\nWhilst E-gene sgRNAs declined before E-gene genomic sequences, some individuals retained sgRNA positivity for up to 68 days.\n\n 13% of sgRNA-positive cases still exhibited clinically relevant levels of virus after 10 days, with no clinical features previously associated with prolonged viral clearance times.\n\n\nConclusions\nOur results suggest that potentially active virus can sometimes persist beyond a 10-day period, and could pose a potential risk of onward transmission.\n\n Where this would pose a serious public health threat, additional mitigation strategies may be necessary to reduce the risk of secondary cases in vulnerable

Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.\n\n\nFindings\n191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital.\n\n 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients).\n\n Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·03–1·17, per year increase; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·61–12·23; p&lt;0·0001), and d-dimer greater

characterisation and epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and

COVID-19 are limited.\n\n\nObjective\nWe sought to evaluate the severity on admission, complications, treatment, and outcomes of patients with COVID-19.\nMethods\nPatients with COVID-19 admitted to Tongji Hospital from January 26, 2020, to February 5, 2020, were retrospectively enrolled and followed-up until March 3, 2020. Potential risk factors for severe COVID-19 were analyzed by a multivariable binary logistic model.\n\n Cox proportional hazard regression model was used for survival analysis in severe patients.\n\n\nResults\nWe identified 269 (49.1%) of 548 patients as severe cases on admission.\n\n Older age, underlying hypertension, high cytokine levels (IL-2R, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-?), and high lactate dehydrogenase level were significantly associated with severe COVID-19 on admission.\n\n The prevalence of asthma in patients with COVID-19 was 0.9%, markedly lower than that in the adult population of Wuhan.\n\n The estimated mortality was 1.1% in nonsevere patients and 32.5% in severe cases during the average 32 days of follow-up period.\n\n Survival analysis revealed that male sex, older age, leukocytosis, high lactate dehydrogenase level, cardiac injury, hyperglycemia, and high-dose corticosteroid use were associated with death in patients with severe COVID-19.\nConclusions\nPatients with older age, hypertension, and high lactate dehydrogenase level need careful observation and early intervention to prevent the potential development of severe COVID-19. Severe male patients with heart injury, hyperglycemia, and high-dose corticosteroid use may have a high risk of death.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7152876","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"American Academy of Allergy, Asthma &amp; Immunology","authors":[{"firstname":"Xiaochen","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shuyun","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Muqing","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ke","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yu","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Min","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhenyu","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Cong","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Junqing","surname":"Yue","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhiguo","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Harald","surname":"Renz","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiansheng","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jungang","surname":"Xie","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Min","surname":"Xie","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jianping","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Cause analysis and treatment strategies of recurrent positive nucleic acid test with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients after discharge from hospital","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1186/s13063-019-4039-3","date":"2019-12-30","title":"Efficacy of acupuncture at three nasal acupoints plus acupoint application for perennial allergic rhinitis: A multicenter, randomized controlled trial protocol","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>Many studies have shown the potential therapeutic effect of acupuncture on allergic rhinitis.\n\n Most of these studies were limited by low-quality evidence.\n\n Preliminary experiments showed that the use of acupuncture at three nasal acupoints plus acupoint application (AAP) achieves a more persistent effect in the treatment of perennial allergic rhinitis than acupuncture alone.\n\n In this study, a multicenter, single-blind, randomized controlled trial will be performed, in which acupuncture at nonmeridian acupoints and sham AAP will be used as the control group to evaluate the effect of AAP through long-term observation.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>The trial is designed on the basis of the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials 2010 guidelines and Standards for Reporting Interventions in Controlled Trials of Acupuncture.\n\n A total of 120 participants with perennial allergic rhinitis will be randomly assigned to a treatment or control group.\n\n A specially appointed investigator will be in charge of randomization.\n\n The participants in the treatment group will be treated with acupuncture at EX-HN3, LI20, and EX-HN8 thrice per week for a total of 12 sessions.\n\n In addition, they will undergo AAP at DU14, BL13, EX-BI, and RN22.

The reported case-fatality rates among the severe COVID-19 varied a lot across different regions from zero to 61.5% and the reason behind remained unclear. Very limited data concerning management of severe cases were reported from low case-fatality areas. In this study, we described the clinical features, multi-strategy management, and respiratory support resources usage for the severe COVID-19 in Sichuan province, where the 28-day case-fatality rate was 0.6% in all patients and 3.7% in severe cases, which was much lower compared with that reported in most of the studies worldwide.\nUsing data from Sichuan Provincial Department of Health, the multicentre cohort study (StUdy of 2019 Novel coRonavirus pneumonia Infected critically ill patients in Sichuan provincE, SUNRISE, ChiCTR2000029758) was performed. All 21 hospitals designated for patients with severe COVID-19 in the province were included. Data were prospectively collected for patients who were still in the hospital after study enrolment, and otherwise retrospectively collected, between January 16 and March 15 [Supplementary Figure 1]. All microbiologically confirmed COVID-19 patients who met any of the five following criteria were included as severe cases: (1) dyspnoea or respiratory frequency &gt;=30 breaths/min; (2) pulse oxygen saturation (SpO2) &lt;=93% without oxygen therapy in resting state; (3) partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen (P/F) ratio &lt;=300 mmHg; (4) lung infiltrates &gt;50% within 24 to 48 h; (5) respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction. The day of enrolment of each patient with severe COVID-19 was considered day 1 (D1). Each patient was followed up from D1 until discharge, death, or the end of the study. Clinical outcomes by D28, including rapid recovery (RR), prolonged recovery (PR), and no recovery (NR), were defined as follows: (1) RR: patient fully meeting the discharge criteria before D28, with normal body temperature &gt;=3 days, obvious improvement in respiratory symptoms and pulmonary imaging, and twice-negative nucleic acid tests (sampling interval being at least 24 h) on respiratory samples; (2) PR: patient partially meeting the discharge criteria on D28 and still requiring hospitalization but without advanced respiratory support; (3) NR: death or the patient still in need of advanced respiratory support on D28. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the West China Hospital and the participating hospitals (No. 2020-131). Informed consent was obtained from the patient or the patient's legally authorized representative.\nEighty-one out of 539 patients were identified as severe cases. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) durations from the onset of symptoms to the first hospitalization and the diagnosis of severe condition were 3 (1-6) and 9 (6-11) days, respectively. Among the five severe diagnostic criteria, P/F &lt;=300 mmHg, SpO2 &lt;=93% without oxygen therapy in resting state, and dyspnoea were the most commonly reported, accounting for 87.7% (71/81), 66.7% (54/81), and 27.2% (22/81), respectively. The median age (IQR) of the patients was 50 (39-65) years, 37.0% (30/81) were female, and 50.6% (41/81) were with a body mass index &gt;=24 kg/m2. The elderly (age &gt;=65 years) accounted for 28.4% (23/81) of the patients and chronic comorbidities were observed in 43 (53.1%) patients. All patients were followed up to the end of the study. Fifty-three (65.4%) were discharged before D28 and regarded as RR. Eighteen (22.2%) patients were regarded as PR, including 13 still in need of conventional oxygen therapy (COT) and five awaiting negative results of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction on D28. Ten patients (12.3%) were in the NR group, including three deaths and seven still in need of advanced respiratory support including high flow nasal cannula (HFNC), non-invasive (NIV) or invasive mechanical ventilation (IV) [Supplementary Table 1].\nAmong the 18 designated hospitals receiving severe cases, only two had standard intensive care unit (ICU) wards, while 16 had provisional ICUs which were transformed from general wards for infectious disease and equipped with ICU team and equipment needed. All 81 severe cases were centralized to the 18 ICUs, among whom 51 (63.0%) were treated in 16 provisional ICUs. Seventy (86.4%) patients were transferred from non-designated hospitals or designated hospitals for non-severe cases, and only 11 (13.6%) were admitted directly. In total, 77 patients (95.1%) were admitted to ICUs by D1 [Supplementary Figure 2].\nRespiratory support was the most commonly used organ support method for patients with severe COVID-19. On D1, 76 patients (93.8%) received respiratory support, including 55 (67.9%) with COT, 13 (16.0%) with NIV, and 8 (9.9%) with HFNC. No patient was intubated or given extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) [Supplementary Figure 3]. During the study period, 79 (97.5%) patients used COT, 31 (38.3%) used HFNC, 22 (27.2%) used NIV, 10 (12.3%) used IV, and 1 (1.2%) used ECMO. Thirty-four patients (42.0%) used only COT among which 79.4% (27/34) were discharged before D28. In the 25 patients who started with COT and needed escalation to advanced respiratory support methods, 12 (48.0%) were discharged by D28. In total, all forms of respiratory support were used 1579 person-day, of which COT took up 62.7% (990 person-day), HFNC 19.3% (305 person-day), NIV 9.4% (149 person-day), IV 8.5% (134 person-day), and ECMO 0.1% (one person-day). The peak needs of respiratory support, which developed on February 5, had a significant lag of 9 days behind the peak of newly diagnosed patients in Sichuan, lasted for 20 days and paralleled with hospitalization needs for severely ill patients [Figure 1].\nDaily respiratory support needs for patients with severe COVID-19. The bar plot shows, for each calendar day, counts of the respiratory support used for patients with severe COVID-19. Daily number of newly diagnosed patients with COVID-19 disease in Sichuan, newly diagnosed severe cases, and cumulative severe cases hospitalized are shown in lines. COVID-19: Coronavirus disease 2019.\nEarly identification of severe COVID-19 is a prerequisite for timely interventions for severe COVID-19. For the diagnosis of severe cases, different criteria were used in the previous studies while some did not report clear criteria. In this study, using the criteria for severe cases proposed by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, none of the severe cases needed mechanical ventilation or ECMO on the day of diagnosis. In particular, our data showed that, on the day of diagnosis of severe COVID-19, up to 72.8% did not present symptoms of dyspnoea and only 33.3% had an SpO2 no less than 93%. Using only dyspnoea or SpO2 as the diagnostic criteria would fail to identify a large number of severe cases of COVID-19 in the early stage and miss the opportunity of intervening in time. P/F ratio was more likely a sensitive indicator for early identification of severe COVID-19, as 87.7% severe cases were identified by using this criterion. With early identification of the severe illness, 93.8% patients in this study received various respiratory support by D1, with a median P/F ratio of 204 mmHg. In the previous studies, the reported median P/F ratio on ICU admission was much lower (103.8-169.0 mmHg). Similar to the patients in Sichuan, the patients outside Wuhan were less severe than those in Wuhan in China. The use of sensitive diagnostic criteria might be crucial for improving prognosis of patients with old age or comorbidity, for whom symptoms may be more atypical and the progression of the disease may be faster than others.\nThe shortage of advanced support equipment such as ventilators is a challenging issue. As there's no definite effective drug to treat COVID-19, appropriate respiratory therapy is essential for severe cases. According to data reported in studies from Wuhan and a study from the US, IV was administered in 38.9% to 71% of severely ill patients. However, in our study, IV was used in only 12.3% of the patients and the case-fatality rate was much lower than that in these studies. This difference may be explained, at least in part, by the timing of intervention. It is reasonable to hypothesize that hypoxemia may participate in multiple organ injury if the hypoxic compensatory period was missed or the patients were not treated timely. Given that the COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly, this finding is of particular interest for treating newly diagnosed severe cases and for regions facing a shortage of ventilators.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank Ms. Hai-Xin Miao and Mr. De-Song Qiu from Sichuan Zhikang Technology CO., Chengdu, for their help of establishing the electronic data capture and analysis system; the authors thank Ms. Yu Ma and Mr. Bi-Wei Zhan from Chengdu Urban Planning Information Technology Centre for the localization and mapping for the designated hospital.

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing
