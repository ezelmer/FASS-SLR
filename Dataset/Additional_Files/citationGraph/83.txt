Acute respiratory distress syndrome and respiratory failure, sepsis, acute cardiac injury, and heart failure were the most common critical complications during exacerbation of covid-19.\nIntroduction\nCoronaviruses are important pathogens of humans and animals that can cause diseases ranging from the common cold to more severe and even fatal respiratory infections. In the past two decades two highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, the coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-Cov) and the coronavirus responsible for Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-Cov),  have emerged in two separate events. They induced lower respiratory tract infection as well as extrapulmonary manifestations, leading to hundreds or thousands of cases with high mortality rates of up to 50% in certain populations. In December 2019 a new strain of coronavirus, officially named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2), was first isolated from three patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention,  connected to the cluster of acute respiratory illness cases from Wuhan, China. Recent epidemiological reports have provided evidence for person to person transmission of the SARS-Cov-2 in family and hospital settings.  As of 28 February 2020, the number of patients infected with SARS-Cov-2 has exceeded 83 652 globally, and more than 2858 have now died of covid-19, with the highest mortality rate of 4.47% in Wuhan. On 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization declared that the outbreak of SARS-Cov-2 constituted a public health emergency of international concern.\nEvidence indicates that substantial similarities exist between severe acute respiratory syndrome and covid-19. A recent study reported a 79.5% genome sequence identity between SARS-Cov-2 and SARS-Cov, and SARS-Cov-2 was 96% identical in terms of whole genome sequence to a bat coronavirus. Clinical and pathological features of patients with covid-19 have recently been reported, showing that the SARS-Cov-2 infection causes clusters of severe and even fatal pneumonia with clinical presentation greatly resembling that of SARS-Cov infection, associated with admission to intensive care units and high mortality. The first study of the initial 41 laboratory confirmed cases with covid-19 showed that 28 (68%) of 41 patients had been discharged and six (15%) had died. A larger case series involving 138 consecutive patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 showed that 47 (34%) patients were discharged and six died (overall mortality 4.3%). Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiological differences between patients who were and were not admitted to the intensive care unit have been fully evaluated. Given that the numbers of patients in these studies is relatively small, information about the clinical characteristics of patients who died is scarce. No vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for covid-19 has yet been shown to be effective, so supportive therapy that eases the symptoms and protects multi-organ function may be beneficial. Identifying or more promptly treating patients in high risk groups is crucial to decrease the mortality rate.\nIn this study, we did a comprehensive evaluation of deceased patients and patients recovered among those with confirmed covid-19 who were previously transferred or admitted to the isolation ward of Wuhan Tongji Hospital, which is one of the designated hospitals assigned by Chinese government for patients severely or critically ill with covid-19. We aimed to compare the demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiological features of patients with different clinical outcomes.\nMethods\nStudy participants and data collection\nFrom 13 January to 12 February 2020, 799 moderately to severely ill or critically ill patients with confirmed covid-19 were transferred from other hospitals or isolation sites or admitted from fever clinics to Tongji Hospital. Tongji Hospital was urgently reconstructed and has been assigned by Chinese government as a designed hospital for severely or critically ill patients with covid-19. As of 28 February 2020, 113 of the 799 patients had died, with a mortality rate of up to 14.1%, and 161 patients had recovered and been discharged. The remaining 525 patients were still in hospital and receiving medical care. All patients were diagnosed as having covid-19 and classified as being moderately, severely, or critically ill according to the Guidance for Corona Virus Disease 2019 (6th edition) released by the National Health Commission of China. All the recovered patients with covid-19 had completely resolved symptoms and signs, had significant improvement in pulmonary and extrapulmonary organ dysfunction, and no longer needed supportive care, with confirmed viral clearance by repeated tests for SARS-Cov-2 before hospital discharge. Written informed consent was waived owing to the rapid emergence of this infectious disease.\nWe obtained epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics, as well as treatment and outcome data, from electronic medical records for deceased patients and recovered patients by using data collection forms. We collected data on demographics, medical history, exposure history, underlying chronic diseases, symptoms and signs, laboratory findings, computed tomographic scans of the chest, and treatment (including antiviral therapy, antibiotics, corticosteroid therapy, and oxygen support) during the hospital admission. The clinical data were monitored up to 28 February 2020. The research team of experienced clinicians from Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology analysed patients' medical records. A trained team of physicians and researchers independently entered and cross checked data in a computerised database. If the core data were missing, we sent requests for clarification to the coordinators, who subsequently contacted the clinicians responsible for the treatment of the patients. As some patients presented with various forms of disorder of consciousness on admission, we obtained data on their medical histories and pre-admission information through contact with their close relatives and by accessing medical records from previous hospital visits.\nThe supplementary table shows the criteria and definitions for the diagnosis, clinical classification (mild, moderate, severe, and critically ill), and complications (acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney injury, sepsis, shock, acute liver injury, acute heart failure, and cardiac injury)    for covid-19.\nLaboratory measurements\nReal time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay for SARS-Cov-2\nThroat swab samples were collected for extracting SARS-Cov-2 RNA from patients. The respiratory sample RNA isolation kit (Biogerm, Shanghai, China) was used to extract total RNA within two hours. Briefly, 40 muL of cell lysates were transferred into a collection tube followed by vortex for 10 seconds. After standing at room temperature for 10 minutes, the collection tube was centrifuged at 1000 revolutions per minute for five minutes. The suspension was used for real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of SARS-Cov-2 RNA. Two target genes:open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) and nucleocapsid protein (N):were simultaneously amplified and tested during the real time RT-PCR assay. Target 1 (ORF1ab) comprised forward primer CCCTGTGGGTTTTACACTTAA, reverse primer ACGATTGTGCATCAGCTGA, and the probe 5'-VIC-CCGTCTGCGGTATGTGGAAAGGTTATGG-BHQ1-3'. Target 2 (N) comprised forward primer GGGGAACTTCTCCTGCTAGAAT, reverse primer CAGACATTTTGCTCTCAAGCTG, and the probe 5'-FAM- TTGCTGCTGCTTGACAGATT-TAMRA-3'. The real time RT-PCR assay was conducted using a SARS-Cov-2 nucleic acid detection kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Shanghai Bio-germ Medical Technology company). The reaction mixture contains 12 muL of reaction buffer, 4 muL of enzyme solution, 4 muL of Probe primers solution, 3 muL of diethyl pyrocarbonate treated water, and 2 muL of RNA template. The RT-PCR assay was conducted under the following conditions: incubation at 50 C for 15 minutes and 95 C for five minutes, 40 cycles of denaturation at 94 C for 15 seconds, and extending and collecting fluorescence signal at 55 C for 45 seconds. A cycle threshold value less than 37 was defined as a positive test result, and a cycle threshold value of 40 or more was defined as a negative test. These diagnostic criteria were based on the recommendation by the National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention (China) (http://ivdc.chinacdc.cn/kyjz/202001/t20200121_211337.html). A medium load, defined as a cycle threshold value of 37 to less than 40, required confirmation by retesting.\nClinical laboratory measurements\nInitial clinical laboratory investigation included a complete blood count, serum biochemical tests (including liver and kidney function, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and electrolytes), a coagulation profile, and cytokine tests. Respiratory specimens, including nasal and pharyngeal swabs, or sputum were tested to exclude evidence of other viral infections, including influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, avian influenza, parainfluenza virus, and adenovirus.\nPrinciples of management of patients\nSupportive therapy\nVital signs and oxygen saturation should be monitored (every eight hours; patients with severe disease need continuous monitoring), supportive treatment strengthened, sufficient calories provided, and the stability of the internal environment, such as water, electrolyte, and acid-base balance, maintained. The intake and output volumes should be strictly balanced, especially in critical ill patients.\nOxygen therapy\nSupplemental oxygen therapy should be given immediately to patients with hypoxaemia. Oxygen therapy can be started at a flow rate of 5 L/min, and the target oxygen saturation is pulse oxygen saturation &gt;=90% in non-pregnant adult patients, &gt;=92-95% in pregnant patients, and &gt;=94% in patients who are critically ill with severe respiratory distress, shock, or coma.\nIf standard oxygen therapy fails, mechanical ventilation should be considered; high flow nasal catheter oxygen or non-invasive ventilation (for example, bilevel positive airway pressure mode) can be used. If no improvement is seen within one hour of non-invasive mechanical ventilation, invasive mechanical ventilation should be used. Experienced experts can recommend extracorporeal membrane pulmonary oxygenation according to their evaluation of the patient's situation.\nEmpirical antimicrobial therapy\nIf a history of seasonal or local influenza epidemiology exists, empirical therapy may be considered.\nBlood purification therapy\nContinuous renal replacement therapy can be used in critically ill patients.\nStatistical analysis\nWe present categorical variables as numbers and percentages and continuous variables as mean and standard deviation if they were normally distributed or median and interquartile range if they were not. We compared means for continuous variables by using independent group t tests when the data were normally distributed; otherwise, we used the Mann-Whitney test. We compared proportions for categorical variables by using the chi2 test. We used Fisher's exact test in the analysis of contingency tables when the sample sizes were small. For unadjusted comparisons, we considered a two sided P value below 0.05 to be statistically significant. We used SPSS (version 19.0) for all analyses.\nPatient and public involvement\nThis was a retrospective case series study, and no patients were involved in the study design or in setting the research questions or the outcome measures directly. No patients were asked to advise on interpretation or writing up of results.\nResults\nDemographics and baseline characteristics of deceased patients and recovered patients\nFrom 13 January to 12 February 2020, 799 moderately to severely ill or critically ill patients with confirmed covid-19 were transferred or admitted to Tongji Hospital. As of 28 February 2020, 113 of these patients had died of covid-19 and 161 patients had fully recovered and been discharged. As shown in table 1, the median age of deceased patients was 68 (interquartile range 62.0-77.0) years, which was significantly older than recovered patients (51 (37.0-66.0) years); 94 (83%) deceased patients and 59 (37%) who recovered were aged 60 or older. Male sex was more predominant in deceased patients (83; 73%) than in recovered patients (88; 55%). Overall, 71 (63%) patients who died and 62 (39%) who recovered had at least one chronic medical condition. Hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and cerebrovascular disease were much more frequent among deceased patients (54 (48%), 16 (14%), and 4 (4%)) than among recovered patients (39 (24%), 7 (4%), and 0 (0%)). Few patients had a current or former cigarette smoking history of at least 30 pack years. The proportion of healthcare workers among deceased patients (1; 1%) was significantly lower than among recovered patients (18; 11%). Likewise, the proportion of patients with a history of close contact with previously confirmed patients tended to be lower in deceased patients (44; 12%) than in recovered patients (33; 20%).\nPresenting characteristics of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 who died and recovered patients.

Other prevalent symptoms at onset of illness in deceased patients included fatigue, dyspnoea, chest tightness, and sputum production; less common symptoms included anorexia, diarrhoea, and myalgia. Dyspnoea and chest tightness were much more common in deceased patients (70 (62%) and 55 (49%)) than in recovered patients (50 (31%) and 48 (30%)). Twenty five (22%) people who died and only one (1%) who recovered had disorders of consciousness on hospital admission. Nine deceased patients and 16 who recovered had no fever, with fatigue, cough, dyspnoea, myalgia, or diarrhoea as the initial symptoms. Among these, one patient with no symptoms who recovered was diagnosed as having covid-19 during routine physical examination, and another complained only of stinging eyes for two weeks before being admitted to hospital.\nAmong the deceased patients, the median time from onset of symptoms to hospital admission was 10.0 (interquartile range 7.0-13.0) days, which tended to be longer than for recovered patients (9.0 (6.0-12.0) days). The median time from onset of symptoms to death in deceased patients was 16 (12.0-20.0) days, and the median time from first symptoms to discharge in recovered patients was 26 (21.8-29.0) days. The median time from admission to death was 5 (3.0-9.3) days and the median time from admission to discharge was 16 (14.0-19.0) days.\nMeasures of vital signs were recorded on the day of hospital admission for all patients. Median systolic blood pressure was significantly higher in deceased patients (137.0 mm Hg) than recovered patients (125.0 mm Hg). More patients who died than who recovered had arterial pressure of 140 mm Hg or higher (50 (44%) v 33 (20%)). Heart rates were much higher in deceased patients (101.0 beats per minute) than in recovered patients (91.0 beats per minute). Respiratory rates were significantly higher in deceased patients (24.0 breaths per minute) than in recovered patients (20.0 breaths per minute). Deceased patients more often developed tachycardia and tachypnoea (respiratory rate &gt;=24 breaths per minute) (56 (50%) and 66 (58%)) than did recovered patients (48 (30%) and 22 (14%)). Seventy two (64%) deceased patients and only 19 (12%) who recovered had percutaneous oxygen saturation of 93% or below on admission.\nLaboratory parameters of deceased patients and recovered patients\nWe observed substantial differences in laboratory findings between patients who died of covid-19 and those who recovered from it (table 2). Fifty six (50%) deceased patients and only six (4%) who recovered developed leukocytosis (white blood cell count &gt;=10x109/L). Deceased patients had persistent and more severe lymphopenia than recovered patients; 44 (39%) deceased patients and eight (5%) recovered patients had lymphocyte counts below 0.5x109/L. Median platelet counts were significantly lower in deceased patients.\nLaboratory findings on admission of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 who died and recovered patients.

and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase were markedly higher in deceased patients than in recovered patients. Fifty nine (52%) deceased patients and 25 (16%) who recovered had abnormal aspartate aminotransferase concentrations (&gt;40 U/L). Albumin concentrations were significantly lower in deceased patients than in recovered patients. Seventy four (65%) deceased patients and 22 (14%) recovered patients developed hypoalbuminaemia (albumin &lt;32 g/L). Concentrations of blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, potassium, triglycerides, creatine kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase were significantly higher in deceased patients than in recovered patients. Concentrations of hypersensitive cardiac troponin I and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide were markedly higher in deceased patients (40.8 pg/mL and 800.0 pg/mL) than in recovered patients (3.3 pg/mL and 72.0 pg/mL), with eight deceased patients having cardiac troponin I above 1000 pg/mL and two above 10 000 pg/mL. In addition, deceased patients more often had increased cardiac troponin I and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide concentrations (68/94 (72%) and 68/80 (85%)) than did recovered patients (15/109 (14%) and 17/93 (18%)).\nMedian prothrombin time was significantly longer in deceased patients than in recovered patients, whereas activated partial thromboplastin time was comparable between the two groups. D-dimer concentrations were markedly greater in deceased patients (4.6 mug/mL) than in recovered patients (0.6 mug/mL). Thirty four (35%) of 97 deceased patients and only three (2%) of 150 recovered patients had D-dimer concentrations above 21mug/mL. Concentrations of procalcitonin, high sensitivity C-reactive protein, and ferritin, as well as erythrocyte sedimentation rate, were significantly higher in deceased patients than in recovered patients. Thirty five (36%) of 96 deceased patients and three (2%) of 140 recovered patients had procalcitonin of 0.5 ng/mL or higher. Thyroid stimulating hormone and free triiodothyronine concentrations were significantly lower in deceased patients (0.7 mIU/mL and 2.8 pmol/L) than in recovered patients (1.4 mIU/mL and 4.3 pmol/L). Serum circulating immunoglobulin A, immunoglobulin G, and immunoglobulin M did not differ significantly between the two groups, whereas complement 3 and complement 4 concentrations were markedly lower in deceased patients than in recovered patients.\nOf patients with available data, concentrations of interleukin 2 receptor, interleukin 6, interleukin 8, interleukin 10, and tumour necrosis factor alpha were significantly higher in deceased patients than in recovered patients. Deceased patients more often had increased concentrations of interleukin 2 receptor, interleukin 6, interleukin 8, interleukin 10, and tumour necrosis factor alpha than did recovered patients. Most (48/53; 91%) deceased patients had undetectable concentrations of interleukin 1beta. Forty two (86%) of 49 deceased patients and 58 (50%) of 117 recovered patients had proteinuria, and 40 (82%) of 49 deceased patients and 44 (38%) of 117 recovered patients showed microscopic haematuria.\nOn admission, abnormalities on chest radiographs were seen in all patients (fig 1); 113 (100%) deceased patients and 152 (94%) recovered patients had bilateral involvement on chest radiographs. Typical findings on chest computed tomography images on admission of deceased patients showed bilateral ground glass opacity and subsegmental areas of consolidation (fig 1, A and C), which then progressed rapidly with mass shadows of high density in both lungs (fig 1, B and D). Representative chest computed tomography images of recovered patients showed right middle lobe and lower lobe ground glass opacity and consolidation (fig 1, E and F); then bilateral ground glass opacity and bilateral consolidation of the lungs progressed but right middle lobe consolidation resolved (fig 1, G). Follow-up images showed obviously resolved bilateral ground glass opacity and consolidation (fig 1, H).\nRepresentative chest computed tomographic images of patients with covid-19 who died and patients who recovered. A-D are chest computed tomograms showing axial view lung window from two deceased patients. Case 1 was a 57 year old women, and case 2 was a 53 year old man. E-H are chest computed tomograms images from a 33 year old woman who recovered. A: image obtained on day 10 after symptom onset shows multiple ground glass opacities and consolidation in bilateral lungs. B: image obtained on day 18 after symptom onset shows progressive multiple ground glass opacities and consolidation in bilateral lungs. C: image obtained on day 9 after symptom onset shows multiple ground glass opacities in bilateral lungs and solid nodule in right lower lobe. D: image obtained on day 13 after symptom onset shows progressive ground glass opacities in bilateral lungs and decreased density of solid nodule in right lower lobe. E: image obtained on day 4 after symptom onset shows right middle lobe and lower lobe consolidation and ground glass opacities. F: image obtained on day 7 after symptom onset shows progressive right middle lobe and lower lobe consolidation and ground glass opacities. G: image obtained on day 11 after symptom onset shows progressive multiple ground glass opacities and consolidation in bilateral lungs and decreased density and range of right middle lobe consolidation. H: after 17 days' therapy, follow-up computed tomograms show ground glass opacities, and consolidation are obviously resolved in bilateral lungs\nArterial blood gases were measured in 35 deceased patients and 32 recovered patients (table 3). Five (14%) deceased patients and 3 (9%) recovered patients had pH below 7.35, whereas 14 (40%) deceased patients and five (16%) recovered patients had pH 7.45 or above. The median arterial partial pressure of oxygen in deceased patients was 59.2 mm Hg, which was significantly lower than that of recovered patients (121.0 mm Hg). Eighteen of 35 deceased patients and none who recovered had arterial partial pressure of oxygen below 60 mmHg, and all of these had partial pressure of carbon dioxide below 50 mmHg, indicating that they had type I respiratory failure. The median arterial partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio was significantly lower in deceased patients (105.1) than in recovered patients (350.0). Moreover, all the deceased patients and 14 (44%) recovered patients had an arterial partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio of 300, indicating that these patients had developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, whereas severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (&lt;=100) developed only in deceased patients (16; 46%). Actual bicarbonate and total carbon dioxide concentration were markedly lower in deceased patients than in recovered patients.\nBlood gas analysis of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 who died and recovered patients.

Common complications observed in deceased patients included acute respiratory distress syndrome (113; 100%), type I respiratory failure (18/35; 51%), sepsis (113; 100%), acute cardiac injury (72/94; 77%), heart failure (41/83; 49%), shock (46; 41%), alkalosis (14/35; 40%), hyperkalaemia (42; 37%), acute kidney injury (28; 25%), and hypoxic encephalopathy (23; 20%). These were significantly more frequent than in recovered patients, showing their potential association with the clinical outcome. Less common complications in deceased patients included acidosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and acute liver injury. One patient who died developed gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with cardiovascular comorbidities were more likely to develop acute cardiac injury and heart failure. In addition, although more deceased patients had chronic hypertension, among patients with available data regardless of history of coexisting cardiovascular disease, cardiac complications were more frequent in deceased patients than in recovered patients.\nComplications and treatments of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 who died and recovered patients.

Invasive mechanical ventilation was needed in 17 (15%) deceased patients, one of whom received extracorporeal membrane pulmonary oxygenation as rescue therapy. Three deceased patients received continuous renal replacement therapy.\nDiscussion\nOur study comprehensively described the major differences in clinical features between the patients who died of covid-19 and those who recovered from it. The median age of deceased patients was significantly older than that of recovered patients. Male sex was more predominant in patients who died than in those who recovered. Chronic hypertension and other cardiovascular comorbidities were more frequent among deceased patients than recovered patients. Symptoms related to hypoxemia were more common in deceased patients than in recovered patients. Deceased patients more often developed systematic inflammation and multi-organ dysfunction than did recovered patients. The indicators of cardiac injury showed more frequent or prominent abnormalities in deceased patients than in recovered patients. The information provided will further enrich knowledge about this critical disease and may consequently help to improve patients' outcomes and lower the fatality rate.\nComparison with other studies\nThe clinical spectrum of covid-19 varies widely, ranging from an asymptomatic infection to severe and critical pneumonia with high fatality rates. The Chinese Centers for Disease Control recently reported that most of the confirmed cases were classified as mild or moderate, 13.8% as severe, and only 4.7% as critically ill. The overall fatality rate for confirmed covid-19 cases was found to be higher in male than in female patients, with the risk of death rising with age for both sexes. The highest fatality rate was in people aged 80 and above.\nThe overall mortality rate of covid-19 is much lower than for severe acute respiratory syndrome (10%) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (30%).  However, covid-19 has ultimately proven more deadly as it has spread to many more people globally than did the others, owing to rapid person to person transmission and atypical symptoms at an early stage in certain patients.  Here, we report a relatively high mortality rate for covid-19 of up to 14.1%, which is higher than in recent reports. This is partly due to a large proportion of severely or critically ill patients admitted to Tongji Hospital, one of the designated hospitals for severe covid-19, and to the medical resource limitations at the beginning of the covid-19 outbreak. These resources were improved by early February, with prompt supply of medics and medical necessities from across the nation to Wuhan. \nIn accordance with the recent reports on characteristics of patients with covid-19 who needed management in intensive care units,   advanced age (&gt;60), male sex, and comorbidities (particularly hypertension) are believed to be risk factors for severe disease and death from SARS-Cov-2 infection. Thus, early vigilant monitoring along with high quality supportive care are needed in patients at high risk. It is notable that healthcare workers as well as close contacts of previously confirmed patients were likely to have a good outcome, which is consistent with the relatively low fatality rate (0.3%) reported in healthcare workers. This could be explained by the fact that in our study the median age of the healthcare workers was much younger than that of the remaining patients (data not shown). It could also be partly due to the lower mortality observed in the second generation of SARS-Cov-2 infection, as well as to the early awareness of potential infection in that scenario meaning that people would seek medical care or start treatment promptly. Furthermore, the time from onset of symptoms to hospital admission was longer in deceased patients, as some of them had been in a critical condition before being transferred from other healthcare units to Tongji Hospital. This highlights the need to develop community awareness about prompt seeking of medical care and earlier referral to the intensive care unit for high risk populations.\nThe incidence of symptoms including fever, cough, fatigue, anorexia, myalgia, and diarrhoea did not differ significantly between deceased patients and recovered patients, whereas dyspnoea, chest tightness, and disorders of consciousness were more common in those who died. Moreover, the vital signs data showed that most deceased patients had tachycardia and/or tachypnoea as well as pulse oxygen saturation of 93% or lower. These signs and symptoms indicated that most deceased patients had been in a severe or critical condition on admission, and the onset of certain symptoms may help physicians to identify the patients at risk of a poor outcome.\nThe differences in abnormalities of laboratory findings between the deceased patients and the survivors were substantial. Most of the deceased patients and only a few recovered patients developed leukocytosis, and one third of deceased patients and only few who recovered had procalcitonin above 0.5 ng/mL, indicating that a large proportion of deceased patients might have had secondary bacterial infection, which could be strongly associated with death. Deceased patients had persistent and more severe lymphopenia compared with recovered patients, suggesting that a cellular immune deficiency state was associated with poor prognosis. In addition, other common laboratory abnormalities in deceased patients included coagulation disorder (elevation of prothrombin time and D-dimer), impaired liver and kidney function (mild or moderate elevation of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine and frequent hypoalbuminaemia, haematuria, and albuminuria), electrolyte disturbance (hyperkalaemia and hypernatraemia), elevated inflammatory markers (high sensitivity C-reactive protein, ferritin, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate), and cytokine storm. Most notably, markedly higher concentrations of creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, cardiac troponin I, and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide were seen in deceased patients than in recovered patients. Increase in cardiac troponin I and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide was much more frequent and significant than that in the recent reports,  likely owing to the relatively small number of deceased patients and more patients at earlier stages of the disease included in those studies.\nIn the later stages of the disease, patients who die may develop pulmonary and extrapulmonary organ damage, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, type I respiratory failure, sepsis, acute cardiac injury, heart failure, acute kidney injury, hypoxic encephalopathy, shock, acidosis or alkalosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and acute liver injury, although the last two complications were less frequent. Development of respiratory, cardiac, and neurological complications is strongly associated with poor outcome in patients with covid-19. Patients with cardiovascular comorbidities were more likely to develop cardiac complications. Cardiac complications were frequent not only in deceased patients with cardiovascular comorbidities but also in those without cardiovascular comorbidities, suggesting that the high risk of cardiac complications in deceased patients could not be entirely ascribed to coexisting cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, in addition to acute respiratory distress syndrome and respiratory failure, acute cardiac injury and heart failure could be major factors contributing to the fatality risk of covid-19 regardless of history of previous cardiovascular disease. However, the pathological report of covid-19 associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome at present shows that pulmonary oedema with hyaline membrane formation in the lungs, but no obvious histological changes in heart tissue, was identified from one single case report. This suggests that the underlying mechanism of cardiac injury needs further exploration. The median time from onset of symptoms to death in deceased patients was 16 days, and the median time from first symptoms to discharge in recovered patients was 26 days. In covid-19, the evolution of pulmonary and systemic inflammation in the first two weeks may determine the physiological progression (resolving or progressing) and outcome of disease (death or survival).\nTo date, no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for covid-19 has proven to be effective, so supportive therapy that eases the symptoms and protects important organs may be most beneficial. In this study, for patients without second bacterial infection, empirical antimicrobial treatment seemed to be ineffective. Fewer deceased patients than recovered received antiviral monotherapy or combination antiviral therapy, as well as interferon alpha inhalation treatment. Considering the severe pneumonia and &quot;cytokine storm&quot; observed in deceased patients, more of these patients were given glucocorticoid therapy than recovered patients. Because of hypoxaemia, significantly more deceased patients than recovered received ventilation. We cannot conclude from this study which antivirals given at the right time would be beneficial, or whether steroid use would be beneficial, for patients with covid-19; further investigation is needed.\nSubstantial similarities exist between covid-19 and severe acute respiratory syndrome, from the virus homology to the potential origin, main transmission route (respiratory droplets), identified receptor (angiotensin converting enzyme 2), clinical manifestation, and disease dynamics. Risk factors for severe covid-19 or severe acute respiratory syndrome outcomes are old age and comorbidities. Progression for patients with severe disease follows a similar pattern for both viruses. Although both viruses can cause severe and even lethal lower respiratory tract infection and extrapulmonary manifestations, myocardial injury and heart failure are more frequently reported in patients with covid-19, indicating a unique pathophysiology. These findings will alert clinicians to pay special attention not only to the development of respiratory dysfunction but also to the signs of cardiac complications.\nLimitations of study\nOur study has several limitations. Firstly, almost all the deceased patients were classified as being severely or critically ill, whereas a large proportion of recovered patients might be classified as having moderate disease. This patient setting reflects the real world situation where most confirmed cases are mild or moderate. Nevertheless, the high incidence of cardiac complications in deceased patients is of great importance, raising awareness of the need for earlier monitoring and cardiac supportive care. Secondly, nearly a third of deceased patients developed disorders of consciousness on admission, ranging from somnolence to deep coma, which may result in a loss of some information (particularly a detailed history and subjective symptoms). Additionally, some laboratory tests (for example, cardiac troponin I, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, and arterial blood gas tests) were not done in all the patients, and missing data or important tests might lead to bias of clinical characteristics. Thirdly, the median length of hospital admission before death was about five days, information on the dynamic changes in laboratory variables in deceased patients was lacking, and the data collected for each patient on admission may have been from different disease stages. Therefore, further study is warranted to gain a better understanding of risk factors for and outcome of covid-19, which ultimately may help to guide efforts aimed at reducing the fatality rate.\nConclusions and policy implications\nCertain patients with covid-19, particularly those with advanced age and hypertension, were in a critical condition on admission and progressed rapidly to death within two to three weeks from disease onset. SARS-Cov-2 infection can cause both pulmonary and systemic inflammation, leading to multi-organ dysfunction in high risk populations. In addition to acute respiratory distress syndrome and type I respiratory failure, acute cardiac injury and heart failure may also contribute to the critical illness state associated with high mortality, which highlights the importance of earlier cardiac monitoring and supportive care in such patients.\nWhat is already known on this topic\nAs of 28 February 2020, more than 2858 people had died of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), with the highest mortality rate of 4.5% in Wuhan, China\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) infection causes clusters of severe and even fatal pneumonia\nClinical characteristics of patients with covid-19 who died have not been fully elucidated yet\nWhat this study adds\nCertain patients with covid-19, particularly those with advanced age and hypertension, were in a critical condition on admission and progressed rapidly to death within two to three weeks from disease onset\nSARS-Cov-2 infection can cause both pulmonary and systemic inflammation, leading to multi-organ dysfunction in high risk populations\nIn addition to acute respiratory distress syndrome and type I respiratory failure, acute cardiac injury and heart failure may also contribute to the critical illness state associated with high mortality\nExtra material supplied by authors\nContributors: TC, DW, HLC, WMY, DLY, and GC contributed equally to this paper, as did KM, DX, HJY, HWW, and TW.

others.\n Subsequently, in what became known as the 20/80 rule, a small percentage of individuals within any population was observed to control most transmission events.\n This empirical rule was shown to govern inter-individual transmission dynamics for many pathogens in several species, and individuals who infect disproportionately more secondary contacts, as compared to most others, became known as super-spreaders.\n Studies conducted in the wake of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic revealed that, in the absence of super-spreading events, most individuals infect few, if any, secondary contacts.\n The analysis of SARS transmission, and reports from other outbreaks, unveil a complex scenario in which super-spreading events are shaped by multiple factors, including co-infection with another pathogen, immune suppression, changes in airflow dynamics, delayed hospital admission, misdiagnosis, and inter-hospital transfers.\n Predicting and identifying super-spreaders open significant medical and public health challenges, and represent important facets of infectious disease management and pandemic preparedness

Evidence for Bats as the Evolutionary Source of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","abstract":"The evolutionary origins of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are unknown.\n Current evidence suggests that insectivorous bats are likely to be the original source, as several 2c CoVs have been described from various species in the family Vespertilionidae.\n Here, we describe a MERS-like CoV identified from a Pipistrellus cf.\n hesperidus bat sampled in Uganda (strain PREDICT/PDF-2180), further supporting the hypothesis that bats are the evolutionary source of MERS-CoV.\n Phylogenetic analysis showed that PREDICT/PDF-2180 is closely related to MERS-CoV across much of its genome, consistent with a common ancestry; however, the spike protein was highly divergent (46% amino acid identity), suggesting that the two viruses may have different receptor binding properties.\n Indeed, several amino acid substitutions were identified in key binding residues that were predicted to block PREDICT/PDF-2180 from attaching to the MERS-CoV DPP4 receptor.\n To experimentally test this hypothesis, an infectious MERS-CoV clone expressing the PREDICT/PDF-2180 spike protein was generated.\n Recombinant viruses derived from the clone were replication competent but unable to spread and establish new infections in Vero cells or primary human airway epithelial cells.\n Our findings suggest that PREDICT/PDF-2180 is unlikely to pose a zoonotic threat.\n Recombination in the S1 subunit of the spike gene was identified as the primary mechanism driving variation in the spike phenotype and was likely one of the critical steps in the evolution and emergence of MERS-CoV in humans.\n","id":"PMC5380844","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"American

SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) replication in the respiratory tract and are available in sufficient numbers for statistical evaluation.\n They are relatively inexpensive and easily accessible, but their use in SARS research is limited because they do not develop illness following infection.\n Older (12- to 14-mo-old) BALB/c mice develop clinical illness and pneumonitis, but they can be hard to procure, and immune senescence complicates pathogenesis studies.\n We adapted the SARS-CoV (Urbani strain) by serial passage in the respiratory tract of young BALB/c mice.\n Fifteen passages resulted in a virus (MA15) that is lethal for mice following intranasal inoculation.\n Lethality is preceded by rapid and high titer viral replication in lungs, viremia, and dissemination of virus to extrapulmonary sites accompanied by lymphopenia, neutrophilia, and pathological changes in the lungs.\n Abundant viral antigen is extensively distributed in bronchial epithelial cells and alveolar pneumocytes, and necrotic cellular debris is present in airways and alveoli, with only mild and focal pneumonitis.\n These observations suggest that mice infected with MA15 die from an overwhelming viral infection with extensive, virally mediated destruction of pneumocytes and ciliated epithelial cells.\n The MA15 virus has six coding mutations associated with adaptation and increased virulence; when introduced into a recombinant SARS-CoV, these mutations result in a highly virulent and lethal virus (rMA15), duplicating the phenotype of the biologically derived MA15 virus.\n Intranasal inoculation with MA15 reproduces many aspects of disease seen in severe human cases of SARS.\n The availability of the MA15 virus will enhance the use of the mouse model for SARS because infection with MA15 causes morbidity, mortality, and pulmonary pathology.\n This virus will be of value as a stringent challenge in evaluation of the efficacy of vaccines and antivirals.\n","id":"PMC1769406","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

of MERS in South Korea.\n Deep-sequencing analysis of MERS-CoV genomes performed on specimens from eight patients revealed significant intrapatient variation; therefore, sequence heterogeneity was further analyzed using targeted deep sequencing.\n A total of 35 specimens from 24 patients (including a super-spreader) were sequenced to detect and analyze variants displaying intrapatient heterogeneity.\n Based on the analysis of nonconsensus sequences, we demonstrated the intrapatient heterogeneity of MERS-CoVs, with the highest level in the super-spreader specimen.\n The heterogeneity could be transmitted in a close association with variation in the consensus sequences, suggesting the occurrence of multiple MERS-CoV infections.\n Analysis of intrapatient heterogeneity revealed a relationship between D510G and I529T mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike glycoprotein.\n These two mutations have been reported to reduce the affinity of the RBD for human CD26.

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.\n\n Increasing quartile of NLR was statistically significantly associated with secondary outcome.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR is associated with outcomes in unselected critically ill patients.\n\n In patients with sepsis, there was no statistically significant relationship between NLR and mortality.\n\n Further investigation is required to increase understanding of the

2019-nCoV).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like

presenting between 12 January 2020 to 6 February 2020. Patients with severe respiratory distress and/ or oxygen requirement at any time during the disease course were excluded.\n\n Repeat Chest CT was obtained at approximately 4 day intervals.\n\n The total CT score was the sum of lung involvement (5 lobes, score 1-5 for each lobe, range, 0 none, 25 maximum) was determined.\n\n\nResults\nTwenty one patients (6 males and 15 females, age 25-63 years) with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated.\n\n These patients under went a total of 82 pulmonary CT scans with a mean interval of 41 days (range: 1-8 days).\n\n All patients were discharged after a mean hospitalized period of 174 days (range: 11-26 days).\n\n Maximum lung involved peaked at approximately 10 days (with the calculated total CT score of 6) from the onset of initial symptoms (R2=0.25), p&lt;0.001).\n\n Based on quartiles of patients from day 0 to day 26 involvement, 4 stages of lung CT were defined: Stage 1 (0-4 days): ground glass opacities (GGO) in 18/24 (75%) patients with the total CT score of 22; (2)Stage-2 (5-8d days): increased crazy-paving pattern 9/17 patients (53%) with a increase in total CT score (64, p=0.002); (3) Stage-3 (9-13days): consolidation 19/21 (91%) patients with the peak of total CT score (74); (4) Stage-4 (?14 days): gradual resolution of consolidation 15/20 (75%) patients with a decreased total CT score (64) without crazy-paving pattern.\n\n\nConclusion\nIn patients recovering from COVID-19 pneumonia (without severe respiratory distress during the disease course), lung abnormalities on chest CT showed greatest severity approximately 10 days after initial onset of symptoms.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7233367","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Radiological Society of North America","authors":[{"firstname":"Feng","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tianhe","surname":"Ye","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tianhe","surname":"Ye","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shan","surname":"Gui","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shan","surname":"Gui","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Liang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Liang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lingli","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lingli","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dandan","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dandan","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiazheng","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiazheng","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Richard L.","surname":"Hesketh","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Richard L.","surname":"Hesketh","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lian","surname":"Yang","email":"yanglian@hust.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lian","surname":"Yang","email":"yanglian@hust.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chuansheng","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chuansheng","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1093/jtm/taaa020","date":"2020-02-10","title":"Isolation, quarantine, social distancing and community containment: pivotal role for old-style public health measures in the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak","abstract":"Public health measures were decisive in controlling the SARS epidemic in 2003.

in confined spaces with relative homogeneous mixing.\n\n On 3 February, 2020, an outbreak of COVID-19 on cruise ship Diamond Princess was reported with 10 initial cases, following an index case on board around 21-25th January.\n\n By 4th February, public health measures such as removal and isolation of ill passengers and quarantine of non-ill passengers were implemented.\n\n By 20th February, 619 of 3700 passengers and crew (17%) were tested positive.\n\n\nMethods\nWe estimated the basic reproduction number from the initial period of the outbreak using SEIR models.\n\n We calibrated the models with transient functions of countermeasures to incidence data.\n\n We additionally estimated a counterfactual scenario in absence of countermeasures, and established a model stratified by crew and guests to study the impact of differential contact rates among the groups.\n\n We also compared scenarios of an earlier versus later evacuation of the ship.\n\n\nResults\nThe basic reproduction rate was initially 4 times higher on-board compared to the \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\usepackage{amsmath}\n\usepackage{wasysym} \n\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\usepackage{amssymb}

COVID-19 poses a great strain on critical care resources in hospitals.\nTrial registration\nChinese Clinical Trial Registry, ChiCTR2000030164. Registered on February 24, 2020, http://www.chictr.org.cn/edit.aspx?pid=49983&amp;htm=4\nBackground\nIn December 2019, a series of patients in Wuhan, China, showed pneumonia-related symptoms and later being diagnosed as a novel coronavirus-caused infectious disease (COVID-19) that marks the outbreak of the epidemic. The spread of the virus is an emerging, rapidly evolving situation and had been declared as a global pandemic by the WHO since March 11, 2020. As of March 15, 2020, there were 153,517 cases being identified worldwide, with 50,003 cases from Wuhan. The COVID-19 pandemic poses enormous burdens and challenges to the medical care system, including intensive care units (ICUs), across different countries. The higher mortality of critically ill patients was reported to be associated with the severity of the shortage of healthcare resources.\nPreviously published studies in describing the epidemiological findings, clinical presentation, and clinical outcomes of the COVID-19 patients were mainly on non-critical patients. To our knowledge, there is only one study that was conducted with critical patients at an early time of the epidemic, which was further limited in the small sample size for the analysis. In addition, all those abovementioned were retrospective studies that may be associated with possible biases or misclassifications due to the nature of retrospective looking. We conducted a multicenter 1-day cross-sectional study on critically ill patients with COVID-19 in 19 local ICUs in Wuhan. Our objective was to elaborate on the outcomes and complications of patients with COVID-19 and the intensity of treatments these patients had received.\nMethods\nStudy design\nThis cross-sectional study was a multicenter, prospective, observational study, in which the study subjects are the patients who were received over 1 day, from 8 AM February 26, 2020, to 8 AM the next day. The involved 19 ICUs are from 16 hospitals that are designated solely for treating COVID-19 patients in Wuhan since the outbreak. There were two coordinative physicians from each of the ICU site joining the study team, who had at least a 3-year ICU working experience. All the ICUs have met the following criteria: having closed adult units, at least 10 beds, and staffed by full-time intensive care physicians and nurses covering 24 h for 7 days. Using a web-based case report form (CRF), after two rounds of pilot testing and modification, each ICU was able to perform a password-protected login to the CRF through a mobile phone connection.\nAll the patients in these ICUs, who were diagnosed with COVID-19 according to the Fifth Edition of Diagnosis and Treatment Protocols for Patients with Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia released by the National Health Commission of China, were registered into the study. No formal exclusion criteria were planned, and all patients' identifiable information had been de-identified before being stored and analyzed. The study was registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2000030164).\nThe criteria for ICU admission\nPatients were admitted to the ICUs if they met one of the following criteria: a respiratory rate of more than 40 breaths per minute, a pressure of arterial oxygen less than 60 mmHg or pulse oxygen saturation less than 90% while the patient was breathing oxygen at a flow rate of 7 L per minute or more for at least 30 min, a pressure of arterial carbon dioxide higher than 50 mmHg, hemodynamic instability and use of vasopressors, a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 12 points or lower, and need of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT).\nData collection and definitions\nThe coordinative physicians at each site were responsible for collecting the following data from the study patients: (1) demographic information, including gender, age, pregnancy yes/no if female, occupation, date of onset of symptoms, and date of admission to ICU; (2) comorbidities; (3) vital signs and complications; (4) results of laboratory test on the study date; (5) major treatments; and (6) outcomes. The living status of all patients was followed up by April 9, 2020. If there were questions or uncertainties in the collection, the physicians went to talk to the patients' primary care doctors for the answer or the best judgment.\nIn the study, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was defined according to the Berlin definition, septic shock was defined according to the Sepsis-3 criteria, and acute kidney injury (AKI) was defined according to the KDIGO criteria. Cardiac injury was defined as the hs-TnI &gt; 28 ng/L or TnI &gt; 0.3 ng/mL.\nFamily information and visitation policies\nThe National Health Commission of China released a statement to classify COVID-19 as a category B infectious disease under the law on prevention and control of infectious diseases but take preventive and control measures of category A infectious diseases. COVID-19 was put under quarantinable infectious disease management according to the Frontier Health and Quarantine Law. Wuhan city was locked down on January 23, 2020; citizens included the family of COVID-19 patients who were asked to stay at home and not go out if not necessary. All the hospitalization patients are not allowed to be visited.\nStatistical analysis\nWe expressed descriptive data as median (with interquartile range) for continuous variables and count (%) for categorical variables. All analyses were carried out using the Stata/IC 15 1 software (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).\nResults\nDemographic and clinical characteristics\nDemographics, clinical characteristics, and clinical outcomes of 226 patients with Coivd-19 in ICUs\nCharacteristics	All patients (n = 226)	 	Age, years	64 (57-70)	 	Gender	 	 Male	139 (61.5%)	 	 Female	87 (38.5%)	 	Occupation	 	 Medical worker	22 (9.7%)	 	 Unprotected exposure history	22 (100%)	 	 Non-medical worker	204 (90.3%)	 	Newly admitted to ICU	9 (4.0%)	 	Duration from the onset of symptom to the current study, days	31 (24-36)	 	Duration from ICU admission to the current study, days	11 (5-17)	 	Comorbidities	155 (68.6%)	 	 Hypertension	96 (42.5%)	 	 Coronary heart disease	22 (9.7%)	 	 Myocardial infarction	6 (2.7%)	 	 Congestive heart failure	4 (1.8%)	 	 Diabetes	47 (20.8%)	 	 Diabetes with organ damage	10 (4.4%)	 	 Diabetes without organ damage	37 (16.4%)	 	 Cerebrovascular disease	15 (6.6%)	 	 Chronic pulmonary disease	15 (6.6%)	 	 Chronic hepatopathy	3 (1.3%)	 	 Chronic nephrosis (without regular dialysis)	3 (1.3%)	 	 Chronic nephrosis (with regular dialysis)	5 (2.2%)	 	 Chronic peptic ulcer	4 (1.8%)	 	 Connective tissue disease	1 (0.4%)	 	 Hemiplegia	4 (1.8%)	 	 Alzheimer's disease	4 (1.8%)	 	 Leukemia or lymphoma	1 (0.4%)	 	 Malignancy tumor	10 (4.4%)	 	Receive radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and long-term or high-dose corticoid therapy	1 (0.4%)	 	Refusal of endotracheal intubation	12 (5.3%)	 	Declaration of do-not-resuscitate	11 (4.9%)	 	Clinical outcome	 	 Remained in ICU	204 (90.3%)	 	 Discharged from ICU	13 (5.7%)	 	 Died	9 (4.0%)	 	\nData are expressed as median (interquartile range) or count (%)\nCOVID-19 coronavirus disease 2019, ICU intensive care unit\nData were collected from 226 patients.

By April 9, 2020, among the 226 patients included, 87 (38.5%) patients were deceased and 15 (6.7%) were still in the hospital (Table 5). \nDiscussion\nIn this cross-sectional study on critically patients with COIVD-19, we found that ARDS occurred in 161 (71.2%), septic shock occurred in 34 (15.0%), AKI in 57 (25.2%), and cardiac injury in 61 (27%) of the 226 patients. Of all of them, 85 (37.6%) were being treated with invasive mechanical ventilation, including 14 (6.2%) on ECMO at the same time; 20 (8.8%) treated with noninvasive mechanical ventilation; and 24 (10.6%) treated with continuous renal replacement therapy. At the follow-up, 121 (53.5%) were performed invasive mechanical ventilation and 87 (38.5%) died.\nTo the extent of our knowledge, this study is by far the only prospective epidemiological study on critically ill patients with COVID-19. Based on the report published by the Chinese CDC, among all COVID-19 in China, 5% were categorized critically ill, i.e., with respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction or failure. On February 26, 2020, the number of accumulated patients with COVID-19 in China was 39,755, which implies a sample of more than 10% of critically ill patients in China by the time have been presented in our study. We hope the information given here will shed light on the timely update of the critically ill patient care in an ICU in this global pandemic. We want to emphasize the major finding from this study that the intensive level of treatments needs to be given to a large portion of patients. In light of the exponential growth trend of the increased number of new COVID-19 cases, the critical care resources should be on the top list of the ICU warehouse against the pandemic disease.\nIn our study, we found that the median age of all the patients included was 64 years, and 61.5% of the patients were male. Previous studies showed that the median age of critically ill patients with COVID-19 was 60-66 years, and 67-70% of these patients were males; ARDS tends to occur in male patients with advanced age. Another earlier publication reported that of the COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU, 61.1% were identified as ARDS, 41.7% received noninvasive ventilation, 47.2% received invasive ventilation, and 11.1% required ECMO. These findings are in agreement or similar to the output of our study. However, from our data, 22 of 79 (36.7%) patients with severe ARDS received prone position ventilation, which was much higher than the 8.7% reported in a cross-sectional survey of ARDS in mainland China in 2018 which did not involve COVID-19 patients. This is a small sign that manifests the differentiation in treating patients in an ICU for a general situation versus the ongoing pandemic.\nWe found that septic shock occurred in 15.0% of critically ill patients with COVID-19. Besides the hospital-acquired infection identified from 49 (21.7%) patients, we postulate that SARS-CoV-2 could play an important role in the development of septic shock, based on the evidence that even 31 (24-36) days after the onset of symptoms, 70.8% still had lymphocytopenia. Whether there is viremia of SARS-CoV-2 causing septic shock is difficult to determine. But the bottom line is that lymphocytopenia was associated with an increased risk of acquired infection in ICU. And lymphocytopenia was proved to be associated with the probability of 28-day septic shock and 28-day mortality.\nThe rate of AKI in critically ill patients with COVID-19 was high. The pathogenesis of AKI has not been fully understood yet, but it may be associated with ACE2, the cell entry receptor of the SARS-CoV-2. It has been identified to be exclusively expressed not only in the respiratory organs, but also in other organs, for example, the kidney, which may facilitate the direct invasion and damage. CRRT was used in 10.6% of our patients during the study, compared with 5% of critically ill patients during the SARS epidemic in Canada. We are facing a worse situation in using CRRT now compared with the SARS outbreak.\nOne unexpected finding was that 57 (35.2%) critically ill patients with COVID-19 were with increased levels of myoglobin. One third of the overall COVID-19 patients were experiencing myalgia. A possible explanation is that the SARS-CoV-2 might damage the muscle system. Whether the damage leads to muscle weakness and thereby causes failure of spontaneous breathing trial needs further evaluation.\nPhysicians treating patients with COVID-19 were under personal protective equipment, which made them impossible to perform an auscultation. Lung ultrasound was an effective technique to replace auscultation and assess the etiologies of lung abnormalities and their severity level. A total of 52 (23.0%) patients received chest or lung ultrasound examinations during the period. At the same time, 56 (24.8%) patients received chest imaging examinations, which might consume more medical resources than ultrasound, especially in the isolation wards. Training more physicians capable of doing chest or lung ultrasound might reduce the dependence on chest imaging examinations.\nPrevious study reported different mortality rates in critically ill patients, from 16.7% to 26%, 61.5%, and 67%. In our study, only 6.7% of the patients were still hospitalized in the general wards or ICUs, compared with 58.3% hospitalized and 58% in ICUs, and 23.1% hospitalized and 24% in ICUs in other studies, respectively. The mortality rates get higher if the follow-up time prolongs. However, the criteria for ICU admission were different among the studies, which was another reason for the different mortality rates.\nOur study has some limitations. First, our study was conducted only in Wuhan, China. But on February 26, 2020, 32,392 in 39,755 (81.5%) patients being treated were in Wuhan. We believe the rate of critically ill patients being treated in Wuhan was higher than 81.5%, which meant that the findings from this study could probably be generalized. Second, the selection of ICUs was not random. However, all the ICUs were selected from the hospital designated for patients with COVID-19 only, and all the ICUs were closed adult units, staffed by qualified full-time intensive care physicians and nurses for 24 h. Third, some important data, for example, arterial blood gas analysis, were not available in some patients. That was because this study was an observational study, and we intended to intervene in the routine practices of different ICUs as less as possible. Forth, the appointed physicians most likely were not the treating physicians for all the patients in their ICUs. All the directors appointed two experienced physicians for the study, who tried to eliminate the bias by clearing uncertainties with the treating physicians.\nConclusion\nCritically ill patients with COVID-19 are associated with considerable rates of severe complications and need treatments of high intensity. COVID-19 poses great strains on critical care resources in hospitals.\nAbbreviations\nCOVID-19\nCoronavirus disease 2019\nICU\nIntensive care unit\nARDS\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome\nECMO\nExtracorporeal membrane oxygenation\nAKI\nAcute kidney injury\nKDIGO\nKidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes\nSOFA\nSequential organ failure assessment\nCRRT\nContinuous renal replacement therapy\nCDC\nCenters for disease control\nPublisher's Note\nSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.\nYuan Yu, Dan Xu, Shouzhi Fu, Jun Zhang, Xiaobo Yang and Liang Xu contributed equally to this work.\nAuthors' contributions\nYY, DX, SF, JZ, XY, LX, JX, YW, CH, YO, LY, MF, HW, JM, WZ, SH, QH, DD, MH, GZ, WX, JG, JiX, HY, and BZ collected the epidemiological and clinical data.

family members (aged 3666 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 36 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 610 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship

of treatment selection, conditional on observed baseline covariates.\n Weighting subjects by the inverse probability of treatment received creates a synthetic sample in which treatment assignment is independent of measured baseline covariates.\n Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) using the propensity score allows one to obtain unbiased estimates of average treatment effects.\n However, these estimates are only valid if there are no residual systematic differences in observed baseline characteristics between treated and control subjects in the sample weighted by the estimated inverse probability of treatment.\n We report on a systematic literature review, in which we found that the use of IPTW has increased rapidly in recent years, but that in the most recent year, a majority of studies did not formally examine whether weighting balanced measured covariates between treatment groups.\n We then proceed to describe a suite of quantitative and qualitative methods that allow one to assess whether measured baseline covariates are balanced between treatment groups in the weighted sample.\n The quantitative methods use the weighted standardized difference to compare means, prevalences, higher?order moments, and interactions.\n The qualitative methods employ graphical methods to compare the distribution of continuous baseline covariates between treated and control subjects in the weighted sample.\n Finally, we illustrate the application of these methods in an empirical case study.\n We propose a formal set of balance diagnostics that contribute towards an evolving concept of best practice when using IPTW to estimate causal treatment effects using observational data.\n  2015 The Authors.\n Statistics in Medicine Published by John Wiley &amp;

with survival analysis","abstract":"id='sim7084-para-0001'>Propensity score methods are used to reduce the effects of observed confounding when using observational data to estimate the effects of treatments or exposures.\n A popular method of using the propensity score is inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW).\n When using this method, a weight is calculated for each subject that is equal to the inverse of the probability of receiving the treatment that was actually received.\n These weights are then incorporated into the analyses to minimize the effects of observed confounding.\n Previous research has found that these methods result in unbiased estimation when estimating the effect of treatment on survival outcomes.\n However, conventional methods of variance estimation were shown to result in biased estimates of standard error.\n In this study, we conducted an extensive set of Monte Carlo simulations to examine different methods of variance estimation when using a weighted Cox proportional hazards model to estimate the effect of treatment.\n We considered three variance estimation methods: (i) a nave model?based variance estimator; (ii) a robust sandwich?type variance estimator; and (iii) a bootstrap variance estimator.\n We considered estimation of both the average treatment effect and the average treatment effect in the treated.\n We found that the use of a bootstrap estimator resulted in approximately correct estimates of standard errors and confidence intervals with the correct coverage rates.\n The other estimators resulted in biased estimates of standard errors and confidence intervals with incorrect coverage rates.\n Our simulations were informed by a case study examining the effect of statin prescribing on mortality.\n  2016

admission","abstract":"Background\n\nSeverely ill patients might develop an alteration of their immune system called post-aggressive immunosuppression.\n\n We sought to assess the risk of ICU-acquired infection and of mortality according to the absolute lymphocyte count at ICU admission and its changes over 3days.\n\n\nMethods\nAdults in ICU for at least 3days with a shock or persistent low blood pressure were extracted from a French ICU database and included.\n\n We evaluated the impact of the absolute lymphocyte count at baseline and its change at day 3 on the incidence of ICU-acquired infection and on the 28-day mortality rate.\n\n We categorized lymphocytes in 4 groups: above 1.5 103 cells/L; between 1 and 1.5 103 cells/L; between 0.5 and 1 103 cells/L; and below 0.5 103 cells/L.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 753 patients were included.\n\n\nThe median lymphocyte count was 0.8 103 cells/L [0.511.29].\n\n A total of 174 (23%) patients developed infections; the 28-day mortality rate was 21% (161/753).\n\n Lymphopenia at admission was associated with ICU-acquired infection (p &lt; 0.001) but not with 28-day mortality.\n\n Independently of baseline lymphocyte count, the absence of lymphocyte count increase at day 3 was associated with ICU-acquired infection (sub-distribution hazard ratio sHR: 1.37 [1.121.67], p = 0.002) and with 28-day mortality (sHR: 1.67 [1.372.03], p &lt; 0.0001).\n\n\nConclusion\nLymphopenia at ICU admission and its persistence at day 3 were associated with an increased risk of ICU-acquired infection, while only persisting lymphopenia predicted increased 28-day mortality.\n\n The lymphocyte count at ICU admission and at day 3 could be used as a simple and reproductive marker of post-aggressive immunosuppression.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13613-017-0242-0) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized

predictor of bacteremia in medical emergencies.\n\n Likewise, the neutrophil-lymphocyte count ratio (NLCR) has been shown a simple promising method to evaluate systemic inflammation in critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe retrospectively evaluated the ability of conventional infection markers, lymphocyte count and NLCR to predict bacteremia in adult patients admitted to the Emergency Department with suspected community-acquired bacteremia.\n\n The C-reactive protein (CRP) level, white blood cell (WBC) count, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count and NLCR were compared between patients with positive blood cultures (n = 92) and age-matched and gender-matched patients with negative blood cultures (n = 92) obtained upon Emergency Department admission.\n\n\nResults\nSignificant differences between patients with positive and negative blood cultures were detected with respect to the CRP level (mean  standard deviation 176  138 mg/l vs.\n\n 116  103 mg/l; P = 0.042), lymphocyte count (0.8  0.5  109/l vs.\n\n 1.2  0.7  109/l; P &lt; 0.0001) and NLCR (20.9  13.3 vs.\n\n 13.2  14.1; P &lt; 0.0001) but not regarding WBC count and neutrophil count.\n\n Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were highest for the NLCR (77.2%, 63.0%, 67.6% and 73.4%, respectively).\n\n The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was highest for the lymphocyte count (0.73; confidence interval: 0.66 to 0.80) and the NLCR (0.73; 0.66 to 0.81).\n\n\nConclusions\nIn an emergency care setting, both lymphocytopenia and NLCR are better predictors of bacteremia than routine parameters like CRP level, WBC count and neutrophil count.\n\n Attention to these markers is easy to integrate in daily practice and without extra

correlate with increased mortality, nosocomial infection and immune dysfunctions in septic shock patients","abstract":"Introduction\nSeptic shock remains a major health care problem worldwide.\n\n Sepsis-induced immune alterations are thought to play a major role in patients' mortality and susceptibility to nosocomial infections.\n\n Programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor system constitutes a newly described immunoregulatory pathway that negatively controls immune responses.\n\n It has recently been shown that PD-1 knock-out mice exhibited a lower mortality in response to experimental sepsis.\n\n The objective of the present study was to investigate PD-1-related molecule expressions in septic shock patients.\n\n\nMethods\nThis prospective and observational study included 64 septic shock patients, 13 trauma patients and 49 healthy individuals.\n\n PD-1-related-molecule expressions were measured by flow cytometry on circulating leukocytes.\n\n Plasmatic interleukin (IL)-10 concentration as well as ex vivo mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation were assessed.\n\n\nResults\nWe observed that septic shock patients displayed increased PD-1, PD-Ligand1 (PD-L1) and PD-L2 monocyte expressions and enhanced PD-1 and PD-L1 CD4+ T lymphocyte expressions at day 1-2 and 3-5 after the onset of shock in comparison with patients with trauma and healthy volunteers.\n\n Importantly, increased expressions were associated with increased occurrence of secondary nosocomial infections and mortality after septic shock as well as with decreased mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation and increased circulating IL-10 concentration.\n\n\nConclusions\nThese findings indicate that PD-1-related molecules may constitute a novel immunoregulatory system involved in sepsis-induced immune alterations.\n\n Results should be confirmed in a larger cohort of patients.\n\n This may offer innovative therapeutic perspectives on the treatment of this hitherto deadly disease.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3219369","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

anti-inflammatory response that lead to a state of immunosuppression, as observed after septic shock.\n\n Diminished monocyte Human Leukocyte Antigen DR (mHLA-DR) is a reliable marker of monocyte dysfunction and immunosuppression.\n\n The main objective of this study was to determine the relation between mHLA-DR expression in severe trauma patients and the development of sepsis.\n\n\nMethods\nWe conducted a prospective observational study over 23 months in a trauma intensive care unit at a university hospital.\n\n Patients with an Injury Severity Score (ISS) over 25 and age over 18 were included.\n\n mHLA-DR was assessed by flow cytometry protocol according to standardized protocol.\n\n Mann-Whitney U-test for continuous non-parametric variables, independent paired t test for continuous parametric variables and chi-square test for categorical data were used.\n\n\nResults\nmHLA-DR was measured three times a week during the first 14 days.\n\n One hundred five consecutive severely injured patients were monitored (ISS 38  17, SAPS II 37  16).\n\n Thirty-seven patients (35%) developed sepsis over the 14 days post-trauma.\n\n At days 1-2, mHLA-DR was diminished in the whole patient population, with no difference with the development of sepsis.\n\n At days 3-4, a highly significant difference appeared between septic and non-septic patients.\n\n Non- septic patients showed an increase in mHLA-DR levels, whereas septic patients did not (13,723  7,766 versus 9,271  6,029 antibodies per cell, p = .\n\n004).\n\n Most importantly, multivariate logistic regression analysis, after adjustment for usual clinical confounders (adjusted OR 5.41, 95% CI 1.42-20.52), revealed that a slope of mHLA-DR expression between days1-2 and days 3-4 below 1.2 remained associated with the development of sepsis.\n\n\nConclusions\nMajor trauma induced an immunosuppression, characterized by a decrease in mHLA-DR expression.\n\n Importantly, after multivariate regression logistic analysis, persistent decreased expression was assessed to be in relation with the development of sepsis.\n\n This is the first study in trauma patients showing a link between the lack of immune recovery and the development of sepsis on the basis of the standardized protocol.\n\n Monitoring immune function by mHLA-DR measurement could be useful to identify trauma patients at a high risk of infection.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3220028","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but the diagnostic performance of lung ultrasound for ARDS is uncertain.\n\n We therefore analyzed the clinical outcomes of ARDS diagnosed according to the Berlin Definition, using either chest radiography (Berlin-CXR) or lung ultrasound (Berlin-LUS) as an alternative imaging method.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>This was a retrospective observational study in a 20-bed medical intensive care unit (ICU).\n\n Patients who required noninvasive ventilation or invasive ventilation for hypoxemic respiratory failure on ICU admission from August 2014 to March 2017 were included.\n\n Both chest radiography and lung ultrasound were performed routinely upon ICU admission.\n\n Comparisons were made using either the Berlin-CXR or Berlin-LUS definitions to diagnose ARDS with respect to the patient characteristics and clinical outcomes for each definition.\n\n ICU and hospital mortality were the main outcome measures for both definitions.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>The first admissions of 456 distinct patients were analyzed.\n\n Compared with the 216 patients who met the Berlin-CXR definition (ICU mortality 19.4%, hospital mortality 36.1%), 229 patients who met the Berlin-LUS definition (ICU mortality 22.7%, hospital mortality 34.5%) and 79 patients who met the Berlin-LUS but not the Berlin-CXR definition (ICU mortality 21.5%, hospital mortality 29.1%) had similar outcomes.\n\n In contrast, the 295 patients who met either definition had higher mortality than the 161 patients who did not meet either definition (ICU mortality 20.0% versus 12.4%, P?=?0.041; hospital mortality 34.2% versus 24.2%, P?=?0.027).\n\n Compared with Berlin-CXR, Berlin-LUS had a positive predictive value of 0.66 (95% confidence interval 0.590.72) and a negative predictive value of 0.71 (0.650.77).\n\n Among the 216 Berlin-CXR ARDS patients, 150 patients (69.4%) also fulfilled Berlin-LUS definition.\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par4'>For the identification of ARDS using the Berlin definition, both chest radiography and lung ultrasound were equally related to mortality.\n\n The Berlin definition using lung ultrasound helped identify patients at higher risk of death, even if these patients did not fulfill the conventional Berlin definition using chest radiography.\n\n However, the moderate overlap of patients when chest imaging modalities differed suggests that chest radiography and lung ultrasound should be complementary rather than used interchangeably.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this

operating characteristic was 3.093 (P = 0.002), the areas under the curve for LUS and CR were 0.901 and 0.590, respectively.\n Our study indicates that LUS can help to diagnosis adult CAP by clinicians and the accuracy was better compared with CR using chest computed tomography scan as the gold standard.\n","id":"PMC4479467","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library

Mortality among these critically ill patients was high. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health.)\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the novel coronavirus first detected in Wuhan, China, that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). Since initial detection of the virus, more than 400,000 cases of Covid-19 have been confirmed worldwide, with the first reported cases in the United States occurring on January 19, 2020, in the state of Washington. The number of cases in Washington continues to rise; as of March 27, 2020, there had been 3700 confirmed Covid-19 cases and 175 deaths. Most of the cases have been in King County, an urban county that includes Seattle and outlying suburbs and accounts for 1760 Covid-19 cases and 125 deaths. Genomic and epidemiologic analyses of sequenced virus RNA recovered in the western Washington region have shown that the spread of SARS-CoV-2 has been the result of local community transmission : meaning that the source of infection cannot be traced back to a known exposure. Person-to-person transmission has also been well documented in skilled nursing and long-term care facilities in the Seattle metropolitan area.\nInitial reports from China and Italy suggest high mortality and stressed intensive care unit (ICU) capacity. Reports describing patients admitted to the ICU with Covid-19 in the United States are limited. A better characterization of Covid-19 infection in critically ill patients is important to guide decision making regarding critical care capacity and allocation of resources. The aim of our multicenter report is to describe the demographic characteristics, coexisting conditions, imaging findings, and outcomes among critically ill patients with Covid-19 in the Seattle metropolitan area.\nMethods\nStudy Population, Setting, and Data Collection\nWe included patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 infection who were admitted to nine hospital ICUs in the Seattle region between February 24 and March 9, 2020. A confirmed case of Covid-19 was defined by a positive result on a reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay of a specimen collected on a nasopharyngeal swab. Only laboratory-confirmed cases were included.\nTwenty-four adults (18 years of age or older) were identified from nine hospitals, including three University of Washington (UW) Medicine Hospitals (Harborview Medical Center, UW Medical Center-Montlake, and Northwest campuses), the Virginia Mason Medical Center, and the Swedish Hospitals (First Hill and Cherry Hill). This group represents six of the eight adult acute care hospitals in the city of Seattle; hospitals connected to these systems in suburbs outside Seattle (UW-Valley Medical Center, Swedish-Issaquah, and Swedish-Edmonds) were also included in the group of nine. Pregnant women, prisoners, and children (those younger than 18 years of age) were excluded from the study. The UW institutional review board approved this study with the reliance agreement (also known as an authorization agreement) of other local medical centers. The institutional review board at Swedish Medical Center also independently approved the study. Informed consent was waived, and researchers analyzed only deidentified (anonymized) data.\nData from each institution's electronic medical record was obtained through a research form in Research Electronic Data Capture software (REDCap, Vanderbilt University). We obtained demographic data, information on clinical symptoms or signs at presentation, and laboratory and radiologic results during ICU admission. All laboratory tests and radiologic assessments, including plain chest radiography and computed tomography of the chest, were performed at the discretion of the treating physician.\nStudy Definitions\nCoexisting conditions were ascertained from physician documentation. Patient data were censored at the time of data cutoff, which occurred on March 23, 2020. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was defined as acute-onset hypoxemia (the ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen [Pao2:Fio2], &lt;300) with bilateral pulmonary opacities on chest imaging that were not fully explained by congestive heart failure or other forms of volume overload.\nSpecimen Collection and Testing\nClinical specimens for Covid-19 diagnostic testing were obtained in accordance with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines. Initially, all clinical specimens were tested with the assay developed by the CDC, targeting the N1 and N2 genes, which was run at the Washington Department of Health State Public Health Laboratory. On March 2, UW began using an assay developed by the UW School of Medicine clinical virology laboratory (see the Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). The assay is based on the World Health Organization standard, and it targets the SARS-CoV-2 E gene and RdRp gene. If both targets are detected, the assay is reported as positive; if one target is detected, the assay is reported as inconclusive and is later confirmed reflexively by the real-time RT-PCR assay developed by the CDC at the Washington State Public Health Laboratory.\nStatistical Analysis\nDescriptive statistics were used to summarize the data; results are reported as medians and interquartile ranges or means and standard deviations, as appropriate. Categorical variables were summarized as counts and percentages. No imputation was made for missing data. Analysis was performed with Stata 15.1 software (StataCorp).\nResults\nDemographic and Clinical Characteristics of the Patients\nDuring the period from February 24 through March 9, we identified 24 critically ill patients with confirmed Covid-19 infection at the nine hospitals surveyed. This number included all patients admitted to the ICU under the care of an intensivist at any time during the hospital stay. The demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients are shown in Table 1. The mean (+-SD) age of the patients was 64+-18 years (range, 23 to 97); 63% were men. The mean duration of symptoms before hospital admission was 7+-4 days. None of the patients had recently traveled to a country with known transmission, such as China, South Korea, Iran, or Italy. A slight majority of patients (13 [54%]) had had recent contact with a person known to have been ill, but whether the sick contacts were infected with SARS-CoV-2 was not known because of the limited availability of testing at the time. Sixteen patients (67%) were admitted from home, and 6 patients (25%) were admitted from a skilled nursing facility. The most common symptoms on admission to the hospital were shortness of breath and cough, each of which occurred in 21 patients (88%). Documented fever was present in 12 patients (50%) on presentation at the hospital. Patient-level data are available in the Supplementary Appendix.\nChronic medical conditions were common in this critically ill population. Fourteen patients (58%) had diabetes mellitus and 5 (21%) had chronic kidney disease; 3 patients (14%) had asthma, and all 3 had recently received, as an outpatient, systemic glucocorticoids for a presumed asthma exacerbation before becoming critically ill. Five patients (22%) were current or former smokers and 1 patient (4%) had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; 8 patients (33%) had more than one coexisting condition.\nLaboratory and Radiologic Findings\nTable 2 shows the laboratory and radiologic findings in the patients on admission and during the ICU course. On admission, lymphocytopenia was common (in 75% of the patients), with a median lymphocyte count of 720 per cubic millimeter (interquartile range, 520 to 1375). Arterial lactate was 1.5 mg per deciliter or higher in 8 patients, and hepatic enzymes were 40 U per liter or higher in 9 patients. Troponin concentrations were elevated in 2 patients early in their ICU course (maximum value, 0.80 ng per deciliter).\nA chest radiograph was obtained in 23 patients (96%) on ICU admission, and all the radiographs showed bilateral pulmonary opacities. No pleural effusions were seen. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the chest was obtained in 5 patients (21%); four of the scans showed bilateral ground glass opacities, and one showed pulmonary nodules. Figure 1 provides representative images from a single patient, illustrating the rapid evolution of pulmonary opacities and the diffuse findings. A video showing the CT cross-sectional images of the chest is available at NEJM.org.\nMicrobiologic Results\nThe performance of the local UW assay was similar to that of the CDC assay in comparison diagnostic testing. All patients had Covid-19 confirmed by an RT-PCR assay of a nasal swab. The UW assay returned one inconclusive result that was later confirmed as positive by the Washington State Public Health Laboratory.\nOf the patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19, nearly all (23 patients [96%]) also had nasopharyngeal swabs sent to test for influenza and respiratory syncytial virus, and 21 patients (88%) had an extended-spectrum respiratory viral panel. None of the patients had a coinfection with another virus (see Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). Sputum samples from 15 patients were sent for bacterial culture, and all were negative for bacterial growth; blood samples from 20 patients were sent, and all remained negative. Bronchoscopy was performed in 4 patients. Two patients had bronchoscopy performed before diagnosis of Covid-19; bacterial and viral RT-PCR results were negative for other respiratory viruses. Two subjects had bronchoscopy performed late in the hospitalization for mucous plugging, without additional cultures.\nRespiratory Failure and Shock\nEighteen patients (75%) received invasive mechanical ventilation (Table 3). For patients who received mechanical ventilation, the Pao2:Fio2 ratios were consistent with moderate-to-severe ARDS. Pulmonary secretions were characterized as either moderate or thick and purulent in 14 patients (77%) during the first 7 days of mechanical ventilation. The median Fio2 on day 1 of mechanical ventilation was 0.9 (interquartile range, 0.7 to 1.0), and the Fio2 improved on day 3 to 0.6 (interquartile range, 0.5 to 0.7). The median driving pressure (the difference between plateau pressure and positive end expiratory pressure [PEEP]) on day 1 of mechanical ventilation was 13 cm of water (interquartile range, 11 to 17). During the first 3 days of mechanical ventilation, the median driving pressure was 12 to 13 cm of water. The median pulmonary compliance on day 1 was 29 ml per cm of water (interquartile range, 25 to 36). The pulmonary compliance improved during the first 3 days of mechanical ventilation, with median compliance on day 3 of 37 ml per cm of water (interquartile range, 25 to 42). Five patients (28%) were placed in a prone position, 7 (39%) received neuromuscular blockade, and 5 (28%) received inhaled pulmonary vasodilators to treat hypoxemic respiratory failure in ARDS. Tracheostomy was not completed in any of the patients.\nSeventeen patients (71%) presented with concurrent hypotension requiring vasopressors, without clear evidence of secondary infection. Of these patients, 3 (18%) had transient hypotension after intubation; 14 (82%) had hypotension that was unrelated to intubation or that persisted for more than 12 hours after intubation. None of the echocardiograms completed in 9 patients (38%) showed new cardiac dysfunction. Seven patients received compassionate-use remdesivir as antiviral therapy, 1 patient received hydroxychloroquine, and 1 patient received lopinavir-ritonavir; no patient received systemic glucocorticoids or tocilizumab in the ICU.\nOutcomes\nAll patients had at least 14 days of hospital follow-up. As of March 23, of the 24 patients, 12 (50%) had died, 4 (17%) had been discharged from the ICU but remained in the hospital, 3 (13%) were receiving mechanical ventilation and were still in the ICU, and 5 (21%) had been discharged from the hospital (Figure 2). A greater percentage of patients over 65 years of age had died than patients under 65 years of age (62% vs. 37%). The 12 deaths included 4 patients (17%) who had do-not-resuscitate orders in place before hospital admission for use in the event of cardiac arrest, and 6 additional patients (25%) had do-not-resuscitate orders that were instituted during their admission.\nThe median length of hospital stay among survivors was 17 days (interquartile range, 16 to 23), and the median length of ICU stay among survivors was 14 days (interquartile range, 4 to 17) (Table 3). The median duration of mechanical ventilation was 10 days (interquartile range, 7 to 12), and 6 patients (33%) had been extubated as of March 23, 2020. Three patients continued to receive ventilatory support, so the durations of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay are likely to be underestimates.\nDiscussion\nThis multicenter case series describes 24 critically ill patients who presented with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 infection. We included all patients with Covid-19 who were admitted to an ICU at nine Seattle-area hospitals between February 24 and March 9, 2020. All the patients had acquired Covid-19 without known exposure to a returning traveler. Coexisting lower respiratory bacterial infections were not identified in sputum and blood cultures obtained early in the clinical course. Overall outcomes were poor in patients who received ICU care.\nThe patients in our series presented with respiratory symptoms similar to those of patients described in reports from China, which indicates a common host response to SARS-CoV-2. Cough was the most common presenting symptom, as it was in reports from China, and the mean duration of symptoms before ICU admission was 1 week. Only half the patients had fever at the time of hospital admission, which suggests that fever may not be a useful criterion to determine the severity of illness and that diagnostic algorithms that require fever for Covid-19 testing may delay diagnosis. The majority of patients had chronic illnesses before their admission to the ICU, most commonly diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease. Lymphocytopenia was common on hospital admission, as it was in reports from China.\nThe case fatality rate of 50% in this series (to date) is similar to that reported among critically ill patients in Chinese hospitals but lower than that in a single-center experience reported from our area. Although the case fatality rate was higher in persons 65 years of age or older, it was still substantial (37%) in persons younger than 65 years of age. Our case fatality rate may be an underestimate, given that 3 patients remained intubated at the time data were censored.\nPatients who received mechanical ventilation had high oxygen requirements soon after initiation of mechanical ventilation, with plateau pressures (mean, 25 cm of water) and driving pressures (mean, 12 to 13 cm of water) similar to those in populations of patients with ARDS enrolled in clinical trials. For example, the mean plateau pressure in the Reevaluation of Systemic Early Neuromuscular Blockade (ROSE) trial was 25 to 26 cm of water. Of the 18 patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation in this series, 6 had been successfully extubated. The earliest extubation occurred 8 days after initiation of invasive mechanical ventilation, which suggests that acute respiratory failure due to Covid-19 may require prolonged mechanical ventilation lasting days to weeks and that readiness for extubation is unlikely to occur early in patients receiving mechanical ventilation. Of patients who were extubated, the age range was 23 to 88 years, which suggests that age may not be the sole indicator for successful extubation.\nA large proportion of patients in this series presented with shock that required vasopressor support. In patients who had an echocardiogram, myocardial dysfunction was uncommon. The lack of bacterial or viral coinfection suggests that the observed shock was directly related to Covid-19. In these preliminary data, Covid-19 infection appears to differ from seasonal influenza, which is commonly associated with bacterial coinfection due to pathogens that colonize the nasopharynx, such as staphylococcus and streptococcus. Regarding antiviral interventions, 7 patients received compassionate-use remdesivir, but we have insufficient information to report associated outcomes. Bronchoscopy was performed in a minority of patients and did not appear to change clinical management.\nThree patients with mild asthma had received systemic glucocorticoids within 1 week before ICU admission, as outpatients, for presumed asthma exacerbation while they had symptoms of Covid-19. These 3 patients then presented to the hospital again, with severe respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. Previous studies have shown that glucocorticoid treatment for phylogenetically similar viruses, SARS-CoV (2003) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), was associated with a higher subsequent plasma viral load, longer duration of viremia, and worse clinical outcomes. These findings are in contrast to those of a recent nonrandomized observational study that suggested that glucocorticoids may be associated with improved clinical outcomes in patients with Covid-19 and ARDS. Further research is necessary to determine the role of systemic glucocorticoids in patients with Covid-19 infection.\nOur study has several notable limitations. First, some cases had incomplete documentation of clinical symptoms, missing laboratory testing, or both. However, given the need to provide objective data and the urgent timeline, we did not approach patients to obtain additional history or biologic samples for laboratory measurement. Second, 7 patients (29%) remained in hospitals at the time of data censoring on March 23, 2020; as a result, outcomes for those patients were not known. Third, because of our focus on the critical care needs of patients with the greatest severity of illness, our sample size is small. Finally, it is possible that critically ill patients with established goals of care that were not consistent with admission to an ICU were not included in this report. Specifically, this includes patients who received care on the general medical ward that focused on comfort measures only.\nThis early experience of the Covid-19 pandemic in the United States resembles the experience in other countries, with high mortality for patients requiring care in the ICU. Patients with coexisting conditions and older age are at risk for severe disease and poor outcomes after ICU admission. Better information is needed to inform care for these challenging patients. Our findings also highlight the importance of planning for mass critical care as the need for ICU care and ventilatory support to treat patients with Covid-19 grows rapidly in the United States.\nSupported by a grant from the National Institutes of Health (K23DK116967, to Dr. Bhatraju).\nDisclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.\nThis article was published on March 30, 2020, at NEJM.org.\nA data sharing statement provided by the authors is available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.\nSupplementary Appendix\nDisclosure Forms\nData Sharing Statement\nReferences\nNovel coronavirus : China\nCoronavirus COVID-19 global cases\nFirst case of 2019 novel coronavirus in the United States.\n2019 Novel coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19)\nCryptic transmission of novel coronavirus revealed by genomic epidemiology\nClinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study.\nCritical care utilization for the COVID-19 outbreak in Lombardy, Italy: early experience and forecast during an emergency response.\nCharacteristics and outcomes of 21 critically ill patients with COVID-19 in Washington State.\nPriorities for the US health community responding to COVID-19.\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome: the Berlin Definition.\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)\nDetection of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by real-time RT-PCR.\nClinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 in China.\nEarly neuromuscular blockade in the acute respiratory distress syndrome.\nProne positioning in severe acute respiratory distress syndrome.\nBacterial coinfection in influenza: a grand rounds review.\nClinical progression and viral load in a community outbreak of coronavirus-associated SARS pneumonia: a prospective study.\nEffects of early corticosteroid treatment on plasma SARS-associated coronavirus RNA concentrations in adult patients.\nCorticosteroid therapy for critically ill patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome.\nCorticosteroids as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of influenza: an updated Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis.\nRisk factors associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome and death in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia in Wuhan, China.\nCare of the critically ill and injured during pandemics and disasters: groundbreaking results from the Task Force on Mass Critical Care.\nIntroduction and executive summary: care of the critically ill and injured during pandemics and disasters: CHEST consensus statement.\nChest Radiographs and CT Images of a 55-Year-Old Patient with SARS-CoV-2.\nAn initial radiograph (anteroposterior view) of the chest at admission (Panel A) shows hazy opacities in the upper and mid lung zones.

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

continuing evolution of SARS-CoV-2","abstract":"The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic started in late December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has since impacted a large portion of China and raised major global concern.\n Herein, we investigated the extent of molecular divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and other related coronaviruses.\n Although we found only 4% variability in genomic nucleotides between SARS-CoV-2 and a bat SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV; RaTG13), the difference at neutral sites was 17%, suggesting the divergence between the two viruses is much larger than previously estimated.\n Our results suggest that the development of new variations in functional sites in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike seen in SARS-CoV-2 and viruses from pangolin SARSr-CoVs are likely caused by natural selection besides recombination.\n Population genetic analyses of 103 SARS-CoV-2 genomes indicated that these viruses had two major lineages (designated L and S), that are well defined by two different SNPs that show nearly complete linkage across the viral strains sequenced to date.\n We found that L lineage was more prevalent than the S lineage within the limited patient samples we examined.\n The implication of these evolutionary changes on disease etiology remains unclear.\n These findings strongly underscores the urgent need for further comprehensive studies that combine viral genomic data, with epidemiological studies of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n","id":"PMC7107875","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Oxford University

We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 490 years (IQR 410580).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 80 days [IQR 50130]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical

Ultrasound May Support Diagnosis and Monitoring of COVID-19 Pneumonia","abstract":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19) is characterized by severe pneumonia and/or acute respiratory distress syndrome in about 20% of infected patients.\n Computed tomography (CT) is the routine imaging technique for diagnosis and monitoring of COVID-19 pneumonia.\n Chest CT has high sensitivity for diagnosis of COVID-19, but is not universally available, requires an infected or unstable patient to be moved to the radiology unit with potential exposure of several people, necessitates proper sanification of the CT room after use and is underutilized in children and pregnant women because of concerns over radiation exposure.\n The increasing frequency of confirmed COVID-19 cases is striking, and new sensitive diagnostic tools are needed to guide clinical practice.\n Lung ultrasound (LUS) is an emerging non-invasive bedside technique that is used to diagnose interstitial lung syndrome through evaluation and quantitation of the number of B-lines, pleural irregularities and nodules or consolidations.\n In patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, LUS reveals a typical pattern of diffuse interstitial lung syndrome, characterized by multiple or confluent bilateral B-lines with spared areas, thickening of the pleural line with pleural line irregularity and peripheral consolidations.\n LUS has been found to be a promising tool for the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia, and LUS findings correlate fairly with those of chest CT scan.\n Compared with CT, LUS has several other advantages, such as lack of exposure to radiation, bedside repeatability during follow-up, low cost and easier application in low-resource settings.\n Consequently, LUS may decrease utilization of conventional diagnostic imaging resources (CT scan and chest X-ray).\n LUS may help in early diagnosis, therapeutic decisions and follow-up monitoring of COVID-19 pneumonia, particularly in the critical care setting and in pregnant women, children and patients in areas with high rates of community transmission.\n","id":"PMC7369598","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine &amp;

non-specific.\n\n\nPurpose\nTo assess the performance of United States (U.\n\nS.\n\n) and Chinese radiologists in differentiating COVID-19 from viral pneumonia on chest CT.\n\n\nMethods\nA total of 219 patients with both positive COVID-19 by RT-PCR and abnormal chest CT findings were retrospectively identified from 7 Chinese hospitals in Hunan Providence, China from January 6 to February 20, 2020. A total of 205 patients with positive Respiratory Pathogen Panel for viral pneumonia and CT findings consistent with or highly suspicious for pneumonia by original radiology interpretation within 7 days of each other were identified from Rhode Island Hospital in Providence, RI.\n\n Three Chinese radiologists blindly reviewed all chest CTs (n=424) to differentiate COVID-19 from viral pneumonia.\n\n A sample of 58 age-matched cases was randomly selected and evaluated by 4 U.\n\nS.\n\n radiologists in a similar fashion.\n\n Different CT features were recorded and compared between the two groups.\n\n\nResults\nFor all chest CTs, three Chinese radiologists correctly differentiated COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 pneumonia 83% (350/424), 80% (338/424), and 60% (255/424) of the time, respectively.\n\n The seven radiologists had sensitivities of 80%, 67%, 97%, 93%, 83%, 73% and 70% and specificities of 100%, 93%, 7%, 100%, 93%, 93%, 100%.\n\n Compared to non-COVID-19 pneumonia, COVID-19 pneumonia was more likely to have a peripheral distribution (80% vs.\n\n 57%, p&lt;0.001), ground-glass opacity (91% vs.\n\n 68%, p&lt;0.001), fine reticular opacity (56% vs.\n\n 22%, p&lt;0.001), and vascular thickening (59% vs.\n\n 22%, p&lt;0.001), but less likely to have a central+peripheral distribution (14.% vs.\n\n 35%, p&lt;0.001), pleural effusion (4.1 vs.\n\n 39%, p&lt;0.001) and lymphadenopathy (2.7% vs.\n\n 10.2%, p&lt;0.001).\n\n\nConclusion\nRadiologists in China and the United States distinguished COVID-19 from viral pneumonia on chest CT with high specificity but moderate sensitivity.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7233414","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Radiological Society of North America","authors":[{"firstname":"Harrison

virus detection.\n\n\nMethods\nWe compared seven published real-time RTPCR assays and two new assays that we have developed.\n\n To determine the analytical sensitivity of each assay, we constructed a synthetic universal control ribonucleic acid (uncRNA) containing all of the assays target regions on one RNA strand and spiked human blood or urine with known quantities of African or Asian Zika virus strains.\n\n Viral loads in 33 samples from Zika virus-infected patients were determined by using one of the new assays.\n\n\nFindings\nOligonucleotides of the published real-time RTPCR assays, showed up to 10 potential mismatches with the Asian lineage causing the current outbreak, compared with 0 to 4 mismatches for the new assays.\n\n The 95% lower detection limit of the seven most sensitive assays ranged from 2.1 to 12.1 uncRNA copies/reaction.\n\n Two assays had lower sensitivities of 17.0 and 1373.3 uncRNA copies/reaction and showed a similar sensitivity when using spiked samples.\n\n The mean viral loads in samples from Zika virus-infected patients were 5??104 RNA copies/mL of blood and 2??104 RNA copies/mL of urine.\n\n\nConclusion\nWe provide reagents and updated protocols for Zika virus detection suitable for the current outbreak strains.\n\n Some published assays might be unsuitable for Zika virus detection, due to the limited sensitivity and potential incompatibility with some strains.\n\n Viral concentrations in the clinical samples were close to the technical detection limit, suggesting that the use of insensitive assays will cause false-negative

severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) during its emergence in humans.\n In spite of intense study, it remains unclear whether the deletion actually reflects adaptation to humans.\n Here we engineered full, partially deleted (?29?nt), and fully deleted ORF8 into a SARS-CoV infectious cDNA clone, strain Frankfurt-1. Replication of the resulting viruses was compared in primate cell cultures as well as Rhinolophus bat cells made permissive for SARS-CoV replication by lentiviral transduction of the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor.\n Cells from cotton rat, goat, and sheep provided control scenarios that represent host systems in which SARS-CoV is neither endemic nor epidemic.\n Independent of the cell system, the truncation of ORF8 (29?nt deletion) decreased replication up to 23-fold.\n The effect was independent of the type I interferon response.\n The 29?nt deletion in SARS-CoV is a deleterious mutation acquired along the initial human-to-human transmission chain.\n The resulting loss of fitness may be due to a founder effect, which has rarely been documented in processes of viral emergence.\n These results have important implications for the retrospective assessment of the threat posed by

infections in adults and children.\n While their clinical representation resembles that of many other agents of the common cold, their evolutionary histories, and host associations could provide important insights into the natural history of past human pandemics.\n For two of these viruses, we have strong evidence suggesting an origin in major livestock species while primordial associations for all four viruses may have existed with bats and rodents.\n HCoV-NL63 and -229E may originate from bat reservoirs as assumed for many other coronaviruses, but HCoV-OC43 and -HKU1 seem more likely to have speciated from rodent-associated viruses.\n HCoV-OC43 is thought to have emerged from ancestors in domestic animals such as cattle or swine.\n The bovine coronavirus has been suggested to be a possible ancestor, from which HCoV-OC43 may have emerged in the context of a pandemic recorded historically at the end of the 19th century.\n New data suggest that HCoV-229E may actually be

The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the

in a manner that summarizes the net effect of an intervention on these two outcomes.\n However, this combining of outcome measures makes VFDs difficult to understand and analyze, which contributes to imprecise interpretations.\n We discuss the strengths and limitations of VFDs and other failure-free day composites, and we provide a framework for when and how to use these outcome measures.\n We also provide a comprehensive discussion of the different analytic methods for analyzing and interpreting VFDs, including Students t tests and rank-sum tests, as well as competing risk regressions treating extubation as the primary outcome and death as the competing risk.\n Using simulations, we illustrate how the statistical test with optimal power depends on the relative contributions of mortality and ventilator duration on the composite effect size.\n Finally, we recommend a simple analysis and reporting framework using the competing risk approach, which provides clear information on the effect size of an intervention, a statistical test and measure of confidence with the ability to adjust for baseline factors and allow interim monitoring for trials.\n We emphasize that any

PRISM score prior to NB-BAL, observations at the time of NB-BAL and arterial blood gases, oxygenation index (OI), ventilator settings, haemodynamic variables and temperature taken at 1h before, and 1 and 6h after NB-BAL, were retrieved from the archived computerised database.\n Results: Median age was 7months (IQR 2.843months) and median weight was 5.5kg (IQR 414kg).\n Four (7%) patients exhibited significant immediate complications, requiring escalation of respiratory or haemodynamic support.\n Forty-two (70%) patients had complete data for calculation of OI; there was no significant change in median OI at 1 and 6h after NB-BAL.\n However 5 (12%) of these patients experienced an increase in OI of between 10 and 45 at 1h post NB-BAL, which returned to baseline at 6h post NB-BAL.\n Complications did not correlate with any of the available variables: baseline OI, PRISM score or with deterioration at the time of the procedure, although it was observed that four out of the six patients with baseline OIs of greater than 20 experienced complications.\n Conclusion: Non-bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage in critically ill mechanically ventilated neonates and children is generally a well-tolerated procedure, but for some patients, in whom it was not possible to elucidate predictive factors, complications developed.\n All patients, particularly those with OIs of greater than 20, require careful monitoring during and after the procedure.\n","id":"PMC7095174","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Springer-Verlag","authors":[{"firstname":"Margarita","surname":"Burmester","email":"margivan@hotmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Quen","surname":"Mok","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1097/PCC.0000000000000435","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Nonpulmonary Treatments for Pediatric Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome: Proceedings From the Pediatric Acute Lung Injury Consensus Conference","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1542/peds.2008-1987","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Functional Status Scale: new pediatric outcome measure","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.3389/fped.2016.00051","date":"2016-05-02","title":"Relevant Outcomes in Pediatric Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Studies","abstract":"Despite distinct epidemiology and outcomes, pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (PARDS) is often managed based on evidence extrapolated from treatment of adults.\n The impact of non-pulmonary processes on mortality as well as the lower mortality rate compared to adults with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) renders the utilization of short-term mortality as a primary outcome measure for interventional studies problematic.\n However, data regarding alternatives to mortality are profoundly understudied, and proposed alternatives, such as ventilator-free days, may be themselves subject to hidden biases.\n Given the neuropsychiatric and functional impairment in adult survivors of ARDS, characterization of these morbidities in children with PARDS is of paramount importance.\n The purpose of this review is to frame these challenges in the context of the existing pediatric literature, and using adult ARDS as a guide, suggest potential clinically relevant outcomes that deserve further investigation.\n The goal is to identify important areas of study in order to better define clinical practice and facilitate future interventional trials in PARDS.\n","id":"PMC4865511","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Frontiers Media S.A.","authors":[{"firstname":"Nadir","surname":"Yehya","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Neal J.","surname":"Thomas","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1136/thorax.55.7.587","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Pediatric origins of adult lung disease. 1.

The conditions and clinical courses of patients with pneumonia were compared with those of patients without pneumonia. Among 70 patients (median age: 67 years) analyzed, the major symptoms were fever (64.3%), cough (54.3%), and general fatigue (24.3%). Forty-three patients (61.4%) had pneumonia. Higher body temperature, heart rate, and respiratory rate as well as higher of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and lower serum albumin level and lymphocyte count were associated with the presence of pneumonia. Ground-glass opacity was found in 97.7% of the patients with pneumonia. Patients were administered neuraminidase inhibitors (20%), lopinavir/ritonavir (32.9%), and ciclesonide inhalation (11.4%). Mechanical ventilation and veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was performed on 14 (20%) and 2 (2.9%) patients, respectively; two patients died. The median duration of intubation was 12 days. The patients with COVID-19 transferred to local hospitals during the outbreak had severe conditions and needed close monitoring. The severity of COVID-19 depends on the presence of pneumonia. High serum LDH, AST and CRP levels and low serum albumin level and lymphocyte count were found to be predictors of pneumonia. It was challenging for local hospitals to admit and treat these patients during the outbreak of COVID-19. Assessment of severity was crucial to manage a large number of patients.\nA novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 in early 2020 abruptly spread within three months from the east-Asian countries to other parts of the world. In Japan, the first outbreak of COVID-19 was reported in a giant cruise ship called the Diamond Princess. This cruise ship had a gross tonnage of 115,000 tons with a maximum capacity of 2706 passengers and 1100 operating staffs. The cruise started on January 20, 2020, from Yokohama stopped at Kagoshima (Southern Japan), Hong Kong, Da Nan and Chan May (Vietnam), Ha Long bay (Vietnam), Keelung (Taiwan) and Okinawa (Southern Japan). At the cruise ship's arrival at Yokohama near the Tokyo metropolitan area early morning on February 3, 2020, 10 people were confirmed to be positive for SARS-CoV-2. Finally, 3618 individuals were screened out of 3711 individuals (2666 guests and 1045 crew) on board on February 3; in total, 696 individuals (19.2%) were confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2. A Japanese quarantine officer, the Disaster Medical Assistance Team, and a small number of infection control specialists were dispatched to quarantine the individuals on board to assess the health status of the individuals on the cruise ship. Hundreds of asymptomatic passengers who were confirmed or suspected to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 were kept isolated on the cruise ship, and they were allowed to disembark from the cruise ship only after the quarantine observation for two weeks. Disembark of 3711 individuals on the cruise ship was completed on March 1. Meanwhile, individuals who required medical care, mainly those with severe symptoms during February 3 and March 1, were transferred to local hospitals near the Yokohama city area, which is the largest city in the Kanagawa Prefecture for medical care. In this study, we describe the clinical conditions, treatment, and the clinical course of the patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 who were transferred from the Diamond Princess cruise ship for further medical care to the participating hospitals in this study.\nThe patients' vital signs, laboratory data, chest radiographs, or computed tomography (CT) findings at the time of admission and treatment, and the data on the clinical course and prognosis were collected using case report forms. Case report forms were collected on March 11 and March 19, 2020. The clinical findings of the patients without pneumonia were compared with those of the patients with pneumonia. The patient race was determined based on the estimation of his/her ancestor by each participating physician. Patient severity was defined according to World Health Organization criteria. No patient was excluded because of bacterial or any other type of viral pneumonia by additional laboratory tests and sputum culture. The specimens for reverse transcription PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was obtained first when the patients were on the Diamond Princess cruise ship or otherwise at the time of transfer to the hospitals, and were submitted to the municipal or governmental laboratories and examined according to the instructions of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (version 2.8 and previous versions). The use of drugs unapproved for the treatment of COVID-19 or severe lower respiratory tract infection in Japan was approved by the clinical ethical committee at each institution. This study was approved by the ethics committees at the Yokohama City University Hospital (approval number: B200200047) and the participating hospitals. Continuous data were presented as medians, and interquartile ranges were presented as (Q1-Q3). Categorical data were presented as numbers and percentages.

The dates of onset of COVID-19 in these patients are summarized in Fig. 1 (date of onset among six patients were missing). The predisposing conditions, general status, vital signs at admission, and laboratory data are shown in Table 1 . The median age of the patients was 67 years; 67.1% of the patients were males, and 80% of the patients were Asians. The predisposing conditions were diabetes (24.3%) and hypertension (22.9%). Very few patients had active malignancy and renal failure. No one had HIV infections and liver dysfunction. The major symptoms of all the 70 patients were fever (64.3%), cough (54.3%), and general fatigue (24.3%). The median duration from onset of COVID-19 to admission was 4 days (2-6 days). Patients with pneumonia had significantly higher body temperatures than those without pneumonia (37.7  C vs. 36.7  C, P &lt; 0.001). Heart rates (88 vs. 78/min) and respiratory rates (20 vs. 16/min) were significantly higher in the patients with pneumonia. Further, 14.3% of the patients with or without pneumonia required supplemental oxygen at the time of admission. Laboratory data taken at admission showed that the serum albumin levels were lower in patients with pneumonia than in those without pneumonia (3.9 vs. 4.2 g/dL), whereas the levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (265 vs. 206 U/L) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (36 vs. 26 U/L) were significantly higher in the patients with pneumonia than in those without pneumonia. The peripheral lymphocyte count was significantly lower in the patients with pneumonia than in those without pneumonia (957 vs. 1461/muL). C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were significantly higher in the patients with pneumonia than in those without pneumonia (3.7 vs. 0.4 mg/dL). Among the 43 patients with pneumonia, consolidation on chest CT was found in 27.9% and ground-glass opacity (GGO) was found in 97.7% of the patients with pneumonia. Notably, GGOs were bilateral (93.0%), multifocal (74.4%), and peripheral dominant (90.7%).\nTreatments and supportive care for the study patients.\nTable 2	 	\n	Total (N = 70)	Patients with pneumonia (n = 43)	Patients with mild illness (n = 27)	 	Antibiotics	 	 Ampicillin/Amoxicillin + BLI	3 (4.3%)	2 (7.0%)	1 (3.7%)	 	 Ceftriaxone	6 (8.6%)	5 (11.6%)	1 (3.7%)	 	 Ceftriaxone + Levofloxacin	7 (10.0%)	7 (16.3%)	0 (0%)	 	 Cefepime + Azithromycin	10 (14.3%)	9 (20.9%)	1 (3.7%)	 	 Meropenem + Azithromycin	2 (2.9%)	1 (2.3%)	1 (3.7%)	 	 Levofloxacin	6 (8.6%)	5 (11.6%)	1 (3.7%)	 	 Azithromycin	7 (10.0%)	5 (11.6%)	2 (7.4%)	 	 No antibiotic was administered	29 (41.4%)	9 (20.9%)	20 (74.1%)	 	Antiviral drugs	 	 Lopinavir/ritonavir	24 (34.2%)	23 (53.5%)	1 (3.7%)	 	 Neuraminidase inhibitor	14 (20.0%)	13 (30.2%)	1 (3.7%)	 	 Ciclesonide	8 (11.4%)	8 (18.6%)	0 (0%)	 	 Favipiravir	3 (4.3%)	3 (7.0%)	0 (0%)	 	 Rivabirin	2 (2.9%)	2 (4.7%)	0 (0%)	 	Other supportive care	 	 Mechanical ventilation	14 (20.0%)	14 (32.6%)	0 (0%)	 	 Steroid pulse therapy	2 (2.9%)	2 (4.7%)	0 (0%)	 	 Intravenous immunoglobulin	6 (8.6%)	6 (14.0%)	0 (0%)	 	 V-V ECMO	2 (2.9%)	2 (4.7%)	0 (0%)	 	\nData are expressed as n (%).\nAbbreviations: BLI, beta-lactamase inhibitors; V-V ECMO, veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.\nRegarding treatments and clinical courses, the median observation period was 16 days (12-21 days) among all cases included in this study. Forty-one (58.6%) patients including 34 with pneumonia and 7 without pneumonia were administered antibiotics. The selected antibiotics are shown in Table 2 . Ceftriaxone and azithromycin were mostly chosen as the antibiotics for the initial treatment. With regard to the anti-viral drugs, the following neuraminidase inhibitors were administered in 14 patients: oseltamivir (n = 6), peramivir (n = 4), baloxavir (n = 1), and a combination of oseltamivir and baloxavir (n = 3). LPV/r was administered to 24 patients. Two patients with pneumonia were treated with a combination of neuraminidase inhibitors, LPV/r, and ribavirin. In addition, ciclesonide inhalation, which was suggested to have anti-coronavirus activity, was administered in 8 patients with pneumonia. Fourteen patients with pneumonia required mechanical ventilation; among them, 2 patients required veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-V ECMO). Two patients died on day 17 and day 21 without extubation. The two patients who underwent V-V ECMO were both alive at the end of the observation period: one patient was successfully extubated on the day 13 of ventilation and the other had been intubated for 23 days using V-V ECMO. Three patients with pneumonia remained intubated for 19-25 days on the mechanical ventilator at the time of end of observation. The remaining 7 patients were successfully extubated after a median of 12 days (6-18 days) on mechanical ventilation. The median duration of hospital admission was 18 days (16-20 days) in 48 patients who were discharged from hospitals during the study period. The median duration between the first positive PCR result and the first negative PCR confirmation was 15 days (10-18 days).\nNotably, the severity of this disease in the patients transferred from the cruise ship was very high compared with that previously reported in the general population in China. The one reason was attributed to advanced age. Generally, the average age of the Japanese passengers on Asian cruise ships is reported to be 57 years. Most of the individuals on the Diamond Princess on February 5, 2020, were aged &gt;=60 years of age. The crowded and closed environment on the cruise ship was possibly a suitable condition for high transmission of respiratory infections. In these individuals with COVID-19, the severity of the disease varied widely from almost asymptomatic to critical cases such as those requiring ventilator support. The initial symptoms :fever, dry cough and general fatigue, were quite nonspecific. The severity of the disease depended on the presence of pneumonia. The findings of our study show that it is critical to differentiate patients with pneumonia from those without pneumonia to predict their clinical course and treatment plan. High LDH and AST levels possibly reflect the interstitial lung inflammation due to COVID-19. Low lymphocyte count and high LDH level were considered key to predict pneumonia in patients with COVID-19 because their levels serve as predictors of severe conditions. The bilateral GGOs was helpful for diagnosing COVID-19. Chest CT is more sensitive than chest radiographs, and the bilateral GGOs in the lower lung lobes are reported to be specific to COVID-19. We suggest that chest CT should be considered if a patient is suspected to have pneumonia due to COVID-19 but PCR findings were still under examination. No treatment regimen has yet been established for the treatment of COVID-19. In the participating hospitals, unapproved drugs were used for the treatment. Treatment with LPV/r, neuraminidase inhibitors, ciclesonide inhalation, favipiravir and rivabirin were attempted. Our colleagues reported that ciclesonide inhalation is effective for the treatment of COVID-19.\nOur study has several limitations. First, data were collected from the case report forms from each attending physician in the participating hospitals. The diagnosis and treatment were depended on the clinical decision of each physician. Second, this study was descriptive and we did not properly evaluate the efficacies of the drugs or the supportive care. Further studies should be performed to assess the efficacy of these drugs for the treatment of severe cases of COVID-19. Third, we were not able to investigate all cases of COVID-19 on the Diamond Princess cruise. The environment inside the cruise ship is suitable for high transmission of respiratory infections. Because individuals with severe conditions during an outbreak are possibly transferred to nearby local hospitals, managing patients during an outbreak is a big challenge to local medical systems. We believe that our findings of patients with COVID-19 during its outbreak on a cruise ship can help to manage a large number of patients infected within a short period of time. Assessment of disease severity was crucial to manage a large number of patients.\nFunding\nWe did not receive any funding support for this study.\nEthical standards\nThis study was approved by the ethics committee at each participating institution.\nDeclaration of Competing Interest\nThe authors have no conflict of interest to declare.\nReferences\nCOVID-19 first stage in Japan - how we treat Diamond princess cruise ship with 3700 passengers?\nClinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study\nClinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 in China\nCOVID-19 outbreak on the Diamond Princess cruise ship: estimating the epidemic potential and effectiveness of public health countermeasures\nClinical characteristics of 138 hospitalized patients with 2019 novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia in Wuhan, China\nTime course of lung changes on chest CT during recovery from 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia\nChest CT for typical 2019-nCoV pneumonia: relationship to negative RT-PCR testing\nA case of coronavirus disease 2019 treated with ciclesonide\nTherapeutic potential of ciclesonide inahalation for COVID-19 pneumonia: report of three cases\nAll authors meet the ICMJE authorship criteria.\n","References depth 1":[{"doi":"10.1002/ams2.506","date":"2020-03-13","title":"COVID?19 first stage in Japan  how we treat Diamond Princess Cruise Ship with 3700 passengers?","abstract":"","id":"PMC7161807","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley and Sons Inc.","authors":[{"firstname":"Ichiro","surname":"Takeuchi","email":"itake@myad.jp","contributions":"3"}],"References depth 2":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30566-3","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study","abstract":"Background\nSince December, 2019, Wuhan, China, has experienced an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).\n\n Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (?18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020.

SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 597 (SD 133) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (615%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 311) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (646 years [112] vs 519 years [129]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (135%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 12 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China","abstract":"Background\nSince December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7092819","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical

transient functions of countermeasures to incidence data.\n\n We additionally estimated a counterfactual scenario in absence of countermeasures, and established a model stratified by crew and guests to study the impact of differential contact rates among the groups.\n\n We also compared scenarios of an earlier versus later evacuation of the ship.\n\n\nResults\nThe basic reproduction rate was initially 4 times higher on-board compared to the \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\usepackage{amsmath}\n\usepackage{wasysym} \n\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\usepackage{amssymb}

within the time period of 21 January to 19 February, 2920 out of the 3700 (79%) would have been infected.\n\n Isolation and quarantine therefore prevented 2307 cases, and lowered the

We showed that an early evacuation of all passengers on 3 February would have been associated with 76 infected persons in their incubation time.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe cruise ship conditions clearly amplified an already highly transmissible disease.\n\n The public health measures prevented more than 2000 additional cases compared to no interventions.\n\n However, evacuating all passengers and crew early on in the outbreak would have prevented many more passengers and crew from infection.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7107563","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Oxford University Press","authors":[{"firstname":"J","surname":"Rocklv","email":"joacim.rocklov@envmed.umu.se","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"H","surname":"Sjdin","email":"henrik.sjodin@umu.se","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"A","surname":"Wilder-Smith","email":"annelies.wilder-smith@lshtm.ac.uk","contributions":"0"}],"References depth 2":[]},{"doi":"10.1001/jama.2020.1585","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical characteristics of 138 hospitalized patients with 2019 novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[]},{"doi":"10.1148/radiol.2020200370","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Time Course of Lung Changes On Chest CT During Recovery From 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nChest CT is used to assess the severity of lung involvement in COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n\nPurpose\nTo determine the change in chest CT findings associated with COVID-19 pneumonia from initial diagnosis until patient recovery.\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\nThis retrospective review included patients with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 infection presenting between 12 January 2020 to 6 February 2020.

As of Feb 19, 2020, the total number of patients has risen sharply to 74 283 in the mainland of China, with 2009 (2 7%) deceased. The clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia ranges from mild to critically ill cases. Previous studies have only described the general epidemiological findings, clinical presentation, and clinical outcomes of patients of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. However, specific information characterising critically ill patients remains unknown.\nThe data on the clinical characteristics and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection are scarce, but are of paramount importance to reduce mortality. In this study, we investigated critically ill patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital. The baseline SARS-CoV-2-associated morbidity and mortality data from this study will be of considerable value for the early identification of individuals who are at risk of becoming critically ill and who are most likely to benefit from intensive care treatment.\nMethods\nStudy design and participants\nThis single-centre, retrospective, observational study was done at Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China), which is a designated hospital to treat patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. All patients, except infected healh-care workers from Jin Yin-tan hospital, were transferred from other hospitals. We retrospectively analysed patients from Dec 24, 2019, to Jan 26, 2020, who had been diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, according to WHO interim guidance, and who were critically ill. Laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection was performed by the local health authority as previously described. Critically ill patients were defined as those admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) who required mechanical ventilation or had a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of at least 60% or more. Identification of critically ill patients was achieved by reviewing and analysing admission logs and histories from all available electronic medical records and patient care resources. For patients who were alive by Jan 26, 2020, their living status was confirmed on Feb 9, 2020.\nResearch in context\n Evidence before this study \nThe novel coronavirus disease 2019 is a disease that has affected populations around the world. We searched PubMed for articles published up to Feb 11, 2020, using the keywords &quot;2019 novel coronavirus&quot;, &quot;2019-nCoV&quot;, &quot;COVID-19&quot;, or &quot;SARS-CoV-2&quot;. We identified eight articles that describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, none of these studies focused on characterising critically ill patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, who are at increased risk of death.\n Added value of this study \nWe report the clinical courses and clinical outcomes of 52 critically ill patients from 710 laboratory-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2. 35 (67%) patients had acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and 37 (71%) required mechanical ventilation. 32 (61 5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from intensive care unit (ICU) admission to death was 7 (IQR 3-11) days in non-survivors. Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64 6 years [11 2] vs 51 9 years [12 9]), more likely to develop acute respiratory distress (ARDS; 26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n Implications of all the available evidence \nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia at 28 days is considerable. The survival time of non-survivors is likely to be within 1-2 weeks after ICU admission. Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death. The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\nThe Ethics Commission of Jin Yin-tan hospital approved this study (KY-2020-06.01). Written informed consent was waived due to the rapid emergence of this infectious disease.\nData collection\nWe reviewed clinical electronic medical records, nursing records, laboratory findings, and radiological examinations for all patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The admission data of these patients were collected. Data were evaluated and collected, by using a case record form modified from the standardised International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium case report forms. Any missing or uncertain records were collected and clarified through direct communication with involved health-care providers and their families.\nWe collected data on age, sex, exposure history, chronic medical histories (chronic cardiac disease, chronic pulmonary disease, cerebrovascular disease, chronic neurological disorder, diabetes, malignancy, dementia, malnutrition, and smoking), symptoms from onset to hospital admission (fever, cough, dyspnoea, myalgia, malaise, rhinorrhoea, arthralgia, chest pain, headache, and vomiting), vital signs at ICU admission (heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure), laboratory values on admission (haemoglobin concentration, lymphocyte count, platelet count, arterial blood gas analysis, FiO2, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2), and lactate concentration), coexisted infection, treatment (oxygen therapy, vasoconstrictive agents, antiviral agents, antibacterial agents, corticosteroids, and immunoglobulin), as well as living status. During the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the number of critically ill patients exceeded the capacity of ICUs. Therefore, two provisional ICUs were urgently established in Jin Yin-tan hospital and hence most mechanical ventilator settings and recordings were not recorded, except records of positive end-expiratory pressure in some cases. As a routine, electronic medical data were archived onto a local server, from which we retrieved these data.\nOutcomes\nThe primary outcome was 28-day mortality after ICU admission. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation. ARDS and shock were defined according to the guidance of WHO for novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Acute kidney injury was identified on the basis of serum creatinine. Cardiac injury was diagnosed if the serum concentration of hypersensitive cardiac troponin I (hsTNI) was above the upper limit of the reference range (&gt;28 pg/mL), measured in the laboratory of Jin Yin-tan Hospital.\nStatistical analysis\nThe aim of this study is to report the clinical courses and clinical outcomes of critically ill patients being cared for in the hospital during the study period. There were, therefore, no formal hypotheses being implemented to drive the sample size calculation and we included the maximum number of patients who met the inclusion criteria.\nWe expressed descriptive data as mean (SD) or median (IQR) for continuous variables and number (%) for categorical variables. We assessed differences between survivors and non-survivors using two-sample t test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test depending on parametric or non-parametric data for continuous variables and Fisher's exact test for categorical variables. We used a Kaplan-Meier plot for survival data.\nTests were two-sided with significance set at alpha less than 0 05. The Stata/IC 15.1 software (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA) was applied for all analyses.\nResults\nStudy flow diagram\nSARS-CoV-2=severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.

SARS-CoV-2=severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. SOFA=Sequential Organ Failure Assessment.\nThe median Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score of all patients was 17 (IQR 14-19; table 3 ). Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax (table 2). The median hsTNI was 161 0 (IQR 41 8-766 1) pg/mL. Hospital-acquired infection was noted in seven (13 5%) patients, including one (2%) patient who had pulmonary and blood stream infection of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. Other microorganisms identified from respiratory tract secretions in five (10%) patients included Aspergillus flavus, A fumigatus, extended-spectrum beta-Lactamase (ESBL)-positive K pneumonia, ESBL-positive Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and ESBL-negative Serratia marcescens, with each microorganism found in one patient each. Candida albicans was identified in the urine culture of one (2%) patient (table 2).\n33 (63 5%) patients were treated with high-flow nasal cannula, 37 (71%) with mechanical ventilation, six (11 5%) with prone position ventilation, six (11 5%) with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), nine (17%) with renal replacement therapy, and 18 (35%) with vasoconstrictive agents (table 2). 23 (44%) patients received antiviral agents, 49 (94%) received antibacterial agents, and 30 (58%) patients received glucocorticoids (table 2). Oseltamivir was given to 18 (35%) patients, ganciclovir to 14 (27%), and lopinavir to seven (13 5%).\nSurvival of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia\nDashed lines represent 95% CIs. One patient died within 24 h after admission to the intensive care unit (ICU).\nFor the primary outcome, among 52 critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 32 (61 5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from ICU admission to death was 7 (IQR 3-11) days in the non-survivors (figure 2 ). Compared with survivors, non-survivors were more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] vs 9 [45%]) and were more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] vs 7 [35%]). 30 (81%) of 37 patients requiring mechanical ventilation had died by 28 days.\nOf the 20 patients who survived, eight patients were discharged. Three patients were still on invasive ventilation at 28 days, including one patient who was also on ECMO. One patient was on non-invasive ventilation, two were using high-flow nasal cannula, and six were using common nasal cannula.\nCompared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64 6 [SD 11 2] vs 51 9 [12 9]) and were more likely to have chronic medical illnesses (17 (53%) patients vs 4 (20%) patients; table 1). Neither the median duration from onset of symptoms to radiological confirmation of pneumonia or from onset of symptoms to ICU admission were different between survivors and non-survivors (table 3). The ratio of partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) to FiO2 was significantly lower in non-survivors. Based on APACHE II score and SOFA score at ICU admission, non-survivors were in a more critical condition than survivors. In the cohort, lymphocytopenia occurred in 44 (85%) patients, with no significant difference between the two groups. Compared with survivors, non-survivors were more likely to develop ARDS, and to receive mechanical ventilation, either invasively or non-invasively.\nDiscussion\nWe report on 52 critically ill patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterised by severe hypoxaemia. 32 (61 5%) of critically ill patients had died at 28 days. Of all included patients, 37 (71%) required mechanical ventilation and 35 (67%) had ARDS.\nSince no specialised medication to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection has been identified at this time, the mainstay of treatment has been supportive care. Patients are being treated in isolation, and their close contacts are being quarantined. For non-critically ill patients, close follow-up is likely to be sufficient to manage the disease. For critically ill patients, however, aggressive treatments and intensive care are needed. To our knowledge, this is the first study to characterise critically ill patients infected by SARS-CoV-2. In three previously published studies of crtically ill patients, the patient numbers were too small to summarise the characteristics and mortality of these patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. \nLike SARS-CoV and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus that can be transmitted to humans, and these viruses are all related to high mortality in critically ill patients. However, the mortality rate in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in our cohort is higher than that previously seen in critically ill patients with SARS. In a cohort of 38 critically ill patients with SARS from 13 hospitals in Canada, 29 (76%) patients required mechanical ventilation, 13 (43%) patients had died at 28 days, and six (16%) patients remained on mechanical ventilation. 17 (38%) of 45 patients and 14 (26%) of 54 patients who were critically ill with SARS infection were also reported to have died at 28 days in a Singapore cohort and a Hong Kong cohort, respectively. The mortality rate in our cohort is likely to be higher than that seen in critically ill patients with MERS infection. In a cohort of 12 patients with MERS from two hospitals in Saudi Arabia, seven (58%) patients had died at 90 days. Since the follow-up time is shorter in our cohort, we postulate that the mortality rate would be higher after 28 days than that seen in patients with MERS-CoV.\nThe fundamental pathophysiology of severe viral pneumonia is severe ARDS. Men and people of an older age (&gt;65 years) are more likely to develop ARDS than women or those of a younger age. Therefore, it is reasonable that the mortality at 28 days of severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is similar to the mortality of severe ARDS, which is near 50%. With a substantial increase in the number of critically ill patients infected by SARS-CoV-2, more provisional ICUs are being established in Wuhan, China. Qualified specialists are coming to Wuhan from other provinces of China and are currently working in these provisional ICUs, fever clinics, and newly constructed hospitals. As the clinical capacity to treat patients improves, the mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is expected to decrease.\nAs mentioned in previous studies, nearly 70% of patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 were men. The patients are older in our study than in previous studies. We observed that non-survivors were older than survivors. Based on previous studies, evidence suggests that older, male patients are the most susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is supported by our data. As previously reported, patients with a history of cerebrovascular disease are at increased risk of becoming critically ill or dying if they have SARS-CoV-2 infection. \nIn our cohort, fever is the most common symptom in patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, which is in accordance with previous studies, but not all patients had fever. We also found that fever was not detected at the onset of illness in six (11 5%), and that it was in fact detected 2-8 days later. The delay of fever manifestation hinders early identification of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2:if patients are asymptomatic identification of suspected cases is more difficult. The median duration from onset of symptoms to radiological confirmation of pneumonia was 5 (3-7) days, meaning that early or repeated radiological examinations are useful in screening patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. \nAs for laboratory tests, lymphocytopenia occurred in more than 80% of critically ill patients in our cohort. Lymphocytopenia is a prominent feature of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV infection because targeted invasion by SARS-CoV viral particles damages the cytoplasmic component of the lymphocyte and causes its destruction. Additionally, lymphocytopenia is also common in the critically ill patients with MERS infection, which is the result of apoptosis of lymphocytes. Therefore, we postulate that necrosis or apoptosis of lymphocytes also induces lymphocytopenia in critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. In a previous study, mainly in non-critical patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, 35% of patients had only mild lymphocytopenia, suggesting that the severity of lymphocytopenia reflects the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nMechanical ventilation is the main supportive treatment for critically ill patients. The PaO2/FiO2 ratio was lower in our patients than in patients admitted to Zhongnan Hospital. The substantial difference in PaO2/FiO2 ratio between survivors and non-survivors in our study, indicates this ratio is associated with the severity of illness and thus prognosis. Barotrauma seems less severe in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who are being mechanically ventilated than that seen in mechanically ventilated patients with SARS-CoV. In our study, barotrauma occurred in only one (2%) patient, who had been hospitalised for nearly 1 month, and he is currently on a ventilator and receiving ECMO. In patients with SARS, barotrauma occurred in about 25% of patients on mechanical ventilation. The lower occurrence of barotrauma in our cohort is probably related to the widely accepted strategy of protective ventilation in mainland China. At the same time, prone position and ECMO have been used to treat patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\nWithout solid evidence, nearly half of the patients were given antiviral agents, and more than half were given intravenous glucocorticoids. Patients treated with lopinavir were from an ongoing clinical trial registered on Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2000029308). Remdesivir was given to the first patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in the USA. Trials on remdesivir are about to recruit both mild to moderate patients (NCT04252664) and severe patients (NCT04257656) infected with SARS-CoV-2. Although, intravenous glucocorticoids were commonly used in patients with severe SARS or MERS pneumonia, their efficacy remains controversial and their use to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection is also controversial. An ongoing clinical trial (NCT04244591) might shed some light on the safety and efficacy of these drugs as treatment.\nThis study has several limitations. First, only 52 critically ill patients were included. However, the population from which they were sampled was much larger than that of the three studies previously published. We included all the critically ill patients being cared for in the ICU of Jin Yin-tan hospital who met the inclusion criteria. Due to the exploratory nature of the study, which was not driven by formal hypotheses, the sample size calculation was waived. Instead, we hope that the findings presented here will encourage a larger cohort study or potentially some randomly controlled trials. Second, some specific information from the ICU was missing, such as mechanical ventilation settings. The data on radiographical examination, supportive treatment, living status, and the duration from ICU admission to death, however, are indisputable. Third, this is a retrospective study. The data in this study permit a preliminary assessment of the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Further studies are still needed.\nIn conclusion, the mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is high. The survival term of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1-2 weeks after ICU admission. Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death. The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain to hospital critical care resources, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n This online publication has been corrected.

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 3666 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 36 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 610 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

mortality in critical illness: an observational cohort study","abstract":"Introduction\nThe neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a biological marker that has been shown to be associated with outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.\n\n Increasing quartile of NLR was statistically significantly associated with secondary outcome.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR is associated with outcomes in unselected critically ill patients.\n\n In patients with sepsis, there was no statistically significant relationship between NLR and mortality.\n\n Further investigation is required to increase understanding of the pathophysiology of this relationship and to validate these findings with data collected prospectively.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article

a major threat to public health13.\n Despite intense research efforts, how, when and where new diseases appear are still a source of considerable uncertainty.\n A severe respiratory disease was recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here WH-Human 1 coronavirus (and has also been referred to as 2019-nCoV).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China5.\n This outbreak highlights the ongoing ability of viral spill-over from animals to cause

Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 490 years (IQR 410580).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 80 days [IQR 50130]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese

The combination of eosinopenia and elevated hs-CRP yielded a sensitivity of 679% and specificity of 782% (AUC=0730).\n\n The addition of eosinopenia alone or the combination of eosinopenia and elevated hs-CRP into the guideline-recommended diagnostic parameters for COVID-19 improved the predictive capacity with higher than zero of both net reclassification improvement (NRI) and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI).\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe combination of eosinopenia and elevated hs-CRP can effectively triage suspected COVID-19 patients from other patients attending the fever clinic with COVID-19-like initial symptoms.\n\n This finding would be particularly useful for designing triage strategies in an epidemic region having a large number of patients with COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases while limited medical resources for nucleic acid tests and radiographic examination.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7196382","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier","authors":[{"firstname":"Qilin","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiuli","surname":"Ding","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Geqing","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Heng-Gui","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fenghua","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhi","surname":"Geng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Luming","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shijun","surname":"Lei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"An","surname":"Pan","email":"panan@hust.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin","surname":"Wang","email":"lin_wang@hust.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng","surname":"Wang","email":"zhengwang@hust.edu.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1001/jamacardio.2020.0950","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Association of cardiac injury with mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1001/jamacardio.2020.1017","date":"2020-03-09","title":"Cardiovascular Implications of Fatal Outcomes of Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)","abstract":"This case series study evaluates the association of underlying cardiovascular disease and myocardial injury on fatal outcomes in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n","id":"PMC7101506","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"American Medical Association","authors":[{"firstname":"Tao","surname":"Guo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yongzhen","surname":"Fan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ming","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoyan","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tao","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hairong","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Wan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xinghuan","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhibing","surname":"Lu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30566-3","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study","abstract":"Background\nSince December, 2019, Wuhan, China, has experienced an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).\n\n Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (?18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020.

respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been reported in Hong Kong.\n\n We investigated the viral cause and clinical presentation among 50 patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe analysed case notes and microbiological findings for 50 patients with SARS, representing more than five separate epidemiologically linked transmission clusters.\n\n We defined the clinical presentation and risk factors associated with severe disease and investigated the causal agents by chest radiography and laboratory testing of nasopharyngeal aspirates and sera samples.\n\n We compared the laboratory findings with those submitted for microbiological investigation of other diseases from patients whose identity was masked.\n\n\nFindings\nPatients' age ranged from 23 to 74 years.\n\n Fever, chills, myalgia, and cough were the most frequent complaints.\n\n When compared with chest radiographic changes, respiratory symptoms and auscultatory findings were disproportionally mild.\n\n Patients who were household contacts of other infected people and had older age, lymphopenia, and liver dysfunction were associated with severe disease.\n\n A virus belonging to the family Coronaviridae was isolated from two patients.\n\n By use of serological and reverse-transcriptase PCR specific for this virus, 45 of 50 patients with SARS, but no controls, had evidence of infection with this virus.\n\n\nInterpretation\nA coronavirus was isolated from patients with SARS that might be the primary agent associated with this disease.\n\n Serological and molecular tests specific for the virus permitted a definitive laboratory diagnosis to be made and allowed further investigation to define whether other cofactors play a part in disease progression.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7112372","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

An integrated database was constructed from several sources containing information on epidemiological, demographic, and clinical variables.\n\n We estimated the key epidemiological distributions: infection to onset, onset to admission, admission to death, and admission to discharge.\n\n We measured associations between the estimated case fatality rate and patientsage and the time from onset to admission.\n\n\nFindings\nAfter the initial phase of exponential growth, the rate of confirmed cases fell to less than 20 per day by April 28. Public-health interventions included encouragement to report to hospital rapidly after the onset of clinical symptoms, contact tracing for confirmed and suspected cases, and quarantining, monitoring, and restricting the travel of contacts.\n\n The mean incubation period of the disease is estimated to be 6.4 days (95% Cl 5.27.7).\n\n The mean time from onset of clinical symptoms to admission to hospital varied between 3 and 5 days, with longer times earlier in the epidemic.\n\n The estimated case fatality rate was 13.2% (9.816.8) for patients younger than 60 years and 43.3% (35.252.4) for patients aged 60 years or older assuming a parametric ? distribution.\n\n A non-parametric method yielded estimates of 6.8% (4.09.6) and 55.0% (45.364.7), respectively.\n\n Case clusters have played an important part in the course of the epidemic.\n\n\nInterpretation\nPatientsage was strongly associated with outcome.\n\n The time between onset of symptoms and admission to hospital did not alter outcome, but shorter intervals will be important to the wider population by restricting the infectious period before patients are placed in quarantine.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7112380","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Christl A","surname":"Donnelly","email":"c.donnelly@imperial.ac.uk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Azra C","surname":"Ghani","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gabriel M","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Anthony J","surname":"Hedley","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christophe","surname":"Fraser","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Steven","surname":"Riley","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Laith J","surname":"Abu-Raddad","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lai-Ming","surname":"Ho","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Thuan-Quoc","surname":"Thach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Patsy","surname":"Chau","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"King-Pan","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tai-Hing","surname":"Lam","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lai-Yin","surname":"Tse","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Thomas","surname":"Tsang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shao-Haei","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"James HB","surname":"Kong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Edith MC","surname":"Lau","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Neil M","surname":"Ferguson","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Roy M","surname":"Anderson","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2003) Updated interim US case definition for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-update, 30 April 2003 http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/casedefinition.htm","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Leigh JM (1990) Oxygen therapy.
