This research discusses the challenges and offers considerations for healthcare organizations and others when setting up and running OSCTCs. It also provides a springboard to engage policy makers and leaders in the healthcare community in a discussion about emergency preparedness, and how to better respond to testing needs going forward.\nIntroduction\nOn March 16th, 2020, the World Health Organization Director-General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, stated the WHO's key aggressive public health response to combat COVID-19 is to &quot;...test, test, test. Test every suspected case.&quot;  \nIn March 2020, medical facilities and public health departments began implementing off-site COVID-19 testing centers across the United States. Off-site COVID-19 testing centers (OSCTC) reduce the risk of exposure to patients and medical staff within medical facilities and minimize the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), which has been reported in short supply across the country. \nBetween March 20th and April 15th, 2020, the Network for Regional Healthcare Improvement (NRHI) in partnership with Qualidigm, a regional member and collaborative healthcare consulting company, conducted a rapid assessment of the then-current conditions of off-site COVID-19 testing centers (OSCTC) across the United States. The team engaged national and regional partners with the goal to share challenges and considerations so others may be better prepared to deploy similar solutions for rapid testing. This study acknowledges that the findings and considerations are based on early and evolving US-based experiences that were impacted by the availability of tests and testing material, personnel, and personal protective equipment (PPE).\nThe assessment is based on eleven qualitative interviews with OSCTC leaders. The interviews covered the site's intake processes, PPE protocols, site origination, challenges, and presents recommended considerations. Although ultimately a convenience sample, selected sites were heterogenous in climate, demographics of community served - including rural and urban settings, testing methodology, criteria, and capacity, type of medical center affiliation, and state/federal partnerships.\nFive key challenges and considerations emerged during the interviews.\nLeaders and partners\nMany OSCTCs partnered with their local or state departments of public health, local civic leaders and police, neighboring healthcare providers, as well as FEMA. State and local partnerships with public health and municipal organizations were often highlighted as valuable, &quot;I think the first success we experienced was good relationships with the Department of Health, engaging them early and often was the key to our success,&quot; commented one respondent.\nWhile most OSCTCs reported successful collaborations with neighboring healthcare provider OSCTCs, others reported struggling with competition, &quot;We were threatened [with] legal action if we continued to allow drive through testing in the parking lot.&quot; FEMA partnerships also reported struggles. &quot;I think that the challenge of working through FEMA, they didn't have clear direction from their leadership, their requirements kept changing.&quot;\nMutually beneficial institutional relationships and diverse, passionate, collaborative, and innovative clinical leaders are characteristics of successful OSCTCs. Priorities of OSCTCs may vary depending on whether the leadership is clinical or administrative. Balancing these priorities is critical in ensuring that all the needs are met.\nStaff protection\nAccording to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), controlling exposures to occupational hazards is fundamental to protecting workers. While elimination or substitution in NIOSH's Hierarchy of Controls are not options at this stage of the pandemic, administrative and engineering controls can be used to protect healthcare workers.\nSome of the strategies OSCTCs utilized to ensure staff is protected included patients remaining in their cars while tested (all but one OSCTC had patients remain in their car) and shorter interaction times. &quot;We go no more than 3 min direct exposure per patient, maximum. So, every 5 min there is a new patient that drives up with their car. And within that 5 min, is the 3-min window of exposure time.&quot; \nDue to shortages in PPE, many respondents referenced using CDC's guidelines for extended and reuse of PPE. Yet, weather and patient demographics may impact appropriate PPE. For example, one respondent reported that face shields that are designed for surgery do not hold up against the elements and were extremely cumbersome when used outside. Respondents reported that they utilized the PPE they had on hand to the best of their abilities, and that availability and climate ultimately dictated how they used their PPE.\nSome OSCTCs have a dedicated &quot;watcher&quot; staff member, who is charged with monitoring all staff members that interact with patients or samples to identify potential contamination and the need to replace PPE. In addition, requiring patients to schedule appointments ensures OSCTCs can plan appropriately for staffing needs, and reduce the time staff interact with patients. OSCTCs often consist of professionals from varying disciplines working together for the first time. Teamwork in healthcare uses collaboration and communication to work towards a common goal. Morning or daily huddles with OSCTC staff was one of the strategies to maintain a working team. &quot;Every morning the team huddles, talks about number of patients that we're going to be seeing today, runs through the workflow and any changes in the workflow being clear on what the role of each of the members of the team is. We also have a debrief at the end of the clinic just to see what went well what didn't go well, what do we need to change and having a rapid process improvement every day has been very helpful.&quot; \nCare for the OSCTC staff must be of highest priority. Having medical and nursing staff as OSCTC leadership is essential to success. Caring for the practical needs of the healthcare workers also extends beyond PPE. Considerations for frequent breaks, access to heaters (based on need), and safety gear in colder environments must be available for healthcare workers in the OSCTC. Moving forward, PPE should continue to serve as an important basic requirement for healthcare workers, but administrative and engineering controls can have significant impacts on staff safety.\nTesting capacity and follow-up process for results\nOSCTCs reported using a combination of state labs, healthcare facility labs, and commercial labs for sample processing and that turnaround times varied greatly based on the type of laboratory -- anywhere from days to weeks. In some cases of significant delays, OSCTCs needed to retest patients to support contact tracing. &quot;...12 to 13 day turn around with one of the send out labs, which makes tracing ... kind of useless honestly.&quot; \nDue to the changing nature of the pandemic, implications of a positive result, and complexities of testing off-site, OSCTCs expressed the importance of thinking through how test results would be shared with patients. One solution was &quot;daily telemedicine visits with patients until they receive results. Once they receive results and they are negative they receive one additional follow-up in 48 h. This is to make sure they do not have a false negative. If they continue to report symptoms, we offer to retest them, and we tell them to continue the quarantine.&quot; Another mentioned the importance of knowing what information to share with patients following results. &quot;We have some scripting for the nurses just to make sure they give a consistent message about when they can return to work, and sort of symptom management. We treat a COVID positive as a &quot;critical&quot; result, and critical results we always send you a paper copy, or an electronic copy, but we always call and we document the call&quot;. \nFor future OSCTCs, it may be useful to think about how patients would best respond to receiving their results. It is important to have the test results given to the patient's primary care provider for follow-up. Some healthcare providers, such as nurses, may not feel comfortable giving positive test results to patients and will need a physician to step in. The dissemination of information to patients must be coordinated to ensure they are receiving timely, information delivered by trained professionals.\nPatients demographics\nWhile many Centers were following CDC guidance to help prioritize who to test, there was wide variation in the populations tested by the sampled centers, which in many cases evolved over just the few weeks that these centers had been open and varied based on PPE availability. If your tests with a quick turnaround time are limited, consider who your priority populations are, and align test with the fastest and most accurate results accordingly.\nSetting up an off-site COVID-19 testing center requires accommodations for diverse demographics. The preparation should begin before the OSCTC begins operating. The public needs to be informed about the OSCTC through multiple channels such as hotlines, media, handouts, and billboards.\nAdditionally, OSCTCs should be prepared to accommodate patients without a vehicle, those who do not speak English, or have physical or mental limitations. Respondents mentioned using a separate protocol to support &quot;walk-ups,&quot; and the importance of pictograms, materials in other languages, use of mobile devices to respond to diverse patient needs.\nTest reimbursement\nWith a new disease, and corresponding new diagnostic tests for that disease, coverage and reimbursement for testing has evolved greatly over a short period of time. CMS has provided two Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes to bill for COVID-19 diagnostic tests, the first on February 13th, 2020 for CDC testing laboratories, and the second on March 5th for non-CDC laboratories.\nThe Families First Coronavirus Response Act, passed on March 14, 2020, requires group health plans and individual health insurance plans to cover COVID-19 testing. Additionally, health insurance carriers are not charging copays or deductibles for COVID-19 testing. OSCTCs generally reported submitting reimbursement for testing to patients' insurance carriers. When testing medical providers, OSCTCs generally covered testing for their employees as a likely medical exposure.\nFuture research questions\nResearch findings are based on a rapid assessment of off-site COVID-19 testing centers in the early weeks of the pandemic in the US. As the pandemic expands and the response evolves, future research can offer additional considerations that address approaches needed to reach broader populations, the availability of new types of tests, the impact of partnerships across sectors, challenges related to financial sustainability, and strategies to protect frontline healthcare workers.\nConclusion\nSARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing improvements will result in faster turnaround times with higher yields. Serology testing is now available and may help quantify population herd immunity. We must work together to effectively use diagnostic tools to prevent the continued spread of SARS-CoV-2. This study provides valuable information that can be used to help organizations learn how some sites are implementing off-site COVID-19 testing centers. It is also a springboard for future research as the pandemic and corresponding diagnostic tools evolve, that ultimately will aid in the development of best practices.\nThe full report, Qualitative

With clear evidence of asymptomatic infection but minimal systematic active surveillance across larger communities, additional efforts to conduct large-scale testing were needed to understand the breadth of COVID-19 disease.\nWhile there have been other efforts to provide drive-through testing (mostly using polymerase chain reaction [PCR] for symptomatic or exposed individuals), no standard procedures existed to safely and efficiently conduct &quot;pop-up&quot; testing using PCR and antibodies for an entire community, particularly in a non-urban setting. The town of Bolinas, California is a coastal town in rural Northern California with a high proportion of elderly residents; early in the pandemic, community leaders were eager to develop university partnerships in order to increase access to SARS-CoV-2 testing. Our objective was to describe the procedures and methodology we used to perform safe, high volume comprehensive testing for SARS-CoV-2 in a non-urban community. To our knowledge, this was the first effort to execute universal PCR and antibody testing for an entire town. By obtaining rapid, comprehensive information about active and past infection, we offer this as one model to augment disease surveillance for rural or suburban populations.\nMethods\nPrior to testing\nCommunity mobilization (patient and public involvement)\nSupport from key stakeholders in the community was crucial to this project's success. In Bolinas, this project was initiated by and co-led by community members, who served as leaders throughout the planning and operational process. Other key stakeholders included the major community-based health organization, the Department of Public Health, and the Fire Department. Most of these groups, together with study leadership, participated in a virtual community meeting the week prior to study start to introduce the study to the community and answer questions. Additionally, specific community liaisons engaged people experiencing homelessness, the Latinx community, and home-bound elders to maximize participation. In summary, while each community has distinct needs, we found that an early needs assessment with regard to community mobilization to identify essential community partners was a most important early step.\nRegistration &amp; pre-test survey\nTown residents and local emergency service providers (such as firefighters, paramedics, etc.) were invited to register online, using a custom interface created on a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliant platform in partnership with study leadership and community liaisons. Residents were directed to begin the process by providing contact information for 2-factor authentication (either phone or email) to ensure security and confirm ability to return results. If they were not able to use the online interface, they could call a local facility, where trained volunteers helped people register online.\nParticipant inclusion in the study was confirmed by providing their zip code or indicating their status as emergency personnel (and/or Bolinas residents). Participants completed an online consent and survey, which included questions about the household as well as demographics, contact information, travel and movement information, symptoms, and medical history. Each household was scheduled for 15-minute appointments allowing no more than five persons per car, and they received a confirmation of their appointment time by their desired mode of contact (mobile phone text message, email). The registration process (via website, telephone, and/or in person) was available in both English and Spanish languages. On the day of testing, participants were emailed or texted with a brief summary of what to expect during their testing experience.\nSample data management\nRobust sample identification was a key aspect to ensuring successful data management, and an important challenge to address in the community-based, &quot;pop-up&quot; context. In accordance with Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) regulations specified by the clinical laboratory, our labels contained two identifiers, name and date of birth (see example below). Labels additionally contained a random letter code in human readable and quick response (QR) code format, to serve as a scannable identifier linking each specimen to a unique participant record in the online database.\n Our site was not equipped for on-demand label printing in each lane, so all pre-registered participants had labels pre-printed the morning prior to testing. Each lane contained a packet of alphabetized, pre-printed water-resistant cryo labels. Each participant had 4 identical labels per sheet: two to be used on the two specimen containers, one on a lab requisition sheet, and one spare label. If the participant registered onsite, the administrator either: (1) used an onsite label printer available in some lanes or (2) used a set of labels with a unique barcode but otherwise blank, and handwrote the participant's name and date of birth on the labels and requisition form.\nDuring test days\nStaffing &amp; flow\nDepicts overall flow through the testing site. Participants entered the site in the lower left corner, and moved clockwise through the site, pausing for specimen collection in each lane while in closest proximity to the tent. Participants on foot were directed to Lane 1, where there were chairs available to set up in the middle of the lane. The staff break area and restrooms were only entered after doffing personal protective equipment.\nIn order to complete testing of more than 1,800 individuals over four days, two tents were set up in a large lot with a lane on either side of each tent, to create four total lanes for testing (Fig. 1). Participants' first interactions were with primarily community volunteers outside the testing area, who then directed participants toward medical staff and volunteers in each lane for testing. \nSite entry &amp; lane triage\nTo help facilitate entry into the site and prevent interference with regular traffic flow in the area, traffic controllers were stationed at the intersection of the main road. Once cars arrived in the designated area, participants were met by a &quot;greeter&quot; who passed out surgical masks to all participants (Additional file 1: Appendix 1). If Spanish-English translation were required, a volunteer translator was engaged at this point (site entry) to help navigate the testing site experience. Local community members volunteered for these three roles, as healthcare experience was not required but local knowledge and a welcoming presence was very helpful.\nNext, a &quot;triage greeter&quot; with a tablet confirmed participants' pre-registration and appointment time and screened for symptoms of COVID-19, including fever, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, myalgias, anosmia, and dysgeusia. If a participant (or anyone in the vehicle) were symptomatic, they were directed to the specified symptomatic lane. If asymptomatic, the triage greeter directed participants to the shortest lane. Because of the symptom assessment, triage greeters were volunteers in the healthcare field who were comfortable with tablet use. Using the online platform on the tablet, the triage greeter indicated which lane the participant moved into, allowing each lane's administrator (sitting in the tent) to view the queue of participants in their lane and prepare for their arrival.\nTesting bay &amp; tent staffing/flow\nDepicts staffing, set up, and flow of two testing lanes, serviced by one tent. Participants slowly pulled forward into the testing lane and were stopped next to the tent. The testing assistant confirmed participant identifiers and verified match with administrator, who handed off pre-made testing kit with materials necessary for specimen collection. The tester explained procedures to the participant and collected samples, with support from testing assistant as needed. The float ensured the specimens were stored correctly, and the administrator logged that testing was complete as the participant exited the testing bay\nThere was one testing bay per lane, each staffed by 4 people: two dyads of 1) professional phlebotomist who performed testing (&quot;tester&quot;) and 2) a healthcare volunteer (primarily nursing, medical, and pharmacy students) who served as the &quot;test assistant&quot; (Fig. 2). Inside the tent, an additional volunteer provided administrative support to each lane. Finally, each tent had two tent supervisors, each of whom was a graduate-level trained nurse, physician, or trained volunteer. As a participant approached the testing bay in any given lane, the test assistant confirmed the participant's name, date of birth, and whether they had symptoms that day. Without entering the tent themselves, the test assistant in the bay relayed this information back to the administrator in the tent, who logged symptoms and prepared a test kit for each participant. \nTo facilitate throughput, test kits containing all supplies necessary to complete testing in the bay (alcohol wipe, lancet, microtainer, gauze, tongue depressor, swab, viral transport media, biohazard bag) were assembled in advance. The administrator's role was primarily to locate the appropriate participant labels and afix labels to (1) the microtainer, (2) the viral transport media tube, and (3) requisition sheet. Labeling and test kit preparation was ideally performed in advance of the participant reaching the testing bay, facilitated by the administrator's ability to view their lane's queue in the online platform.\nIn the testing bay, a car pulled into the bay and turned off the engine. If participants arrived on foot or other vehicle, to accommodate those without access to a car, they were seated in a chair in the middle of the lane. The tester explained the procedure, and completed finger stick then oropharyngeal/mid-turbinate swab (see Test Procedures for more detail). The test assistant maintained distance from the participant during specimen collection, but was on hand to pass items to the testers. Extra test assistants were trained, with additional test assistants helping as runners/quality control leads when not working actively in the testing bays. Once a participant had completed testing, the test assistant verbally reported completion to the in-tent administrator, and the administrator noted whether tests were successfully administered and that the label barcode matched the database barcode. The participant exited the lane and testing site.\nEach tent was also staffed with two tent supervisors, whose role was to trouble-shoot all activities in the testing bay and tent, including responding to participant questions, and ensuring operations ran efficiently. See Additional file 1: Appendix 1 for summary of staffing required per day. Finally, on-site staff were screened with an email-based questionnaire before each day to ensure they did not have symptoms associated with COVID-19 (Additional file 2: Appendix 2).\nTest procedures\nOur testing strategy employed both blood collection for antibody testing and upper respiratory tract sampling for PCR testing. With regard to collection of blood, our goal was to maximize community participation by lowering barriers to sampling through use of a finger prick technique (vs. phlebotomy), while collecting enough blood to be sufficient to run quantitative, laboratory-based tests. Please see Additional file 3: Appendix 3 for detailed procedures utilized for sample collection.\nPPE requirements\nWe constructed personal protective equipment (PPE) requirements using the following framework adapted from World Health Organization guiding principles: (1) consider the type of contact with participants, (2) incorporate transmission dynamics and environmental factors pertinent to the testing site, and (3) utilize stewardship and appropriate PPE re-use when possible.\n For each role, we defined the degree of contact with participants and whether possible to adhere to physical distancing while performing the role. For example, the tester role involved physical contact with participants' hands and proximity to unmasked participants during oropharyngeal and mid-turbinate specimen collection that may lead to sneeze or cough. As follows, PPE requirements for this role were the most stringent, including coveralls (or gown), gloves, respirator, and face shield. Conversely, the test assistant did not have physical contact with participants nor were they in close proximity during specimen collection but did talk with participants prior to testing and were also handling specimens after collection. As such, the recommended PPE for this role was a surgical mask, face shield, and gloves. Please see Additional file 1: Appendix 1 for detailed PPE recommendations for all roles. When considering generalizability to other testing approaches, the most important consideration should be given to the movements and participant interactions involved in each role with PPE recommendations based on associated exposure risk.\nFinally, with regard to PPE reuse, we modeled our guidelines after our medical center and CDC guidelines to minimize waste of materials (all materials listed in Additional file 4: Appendix 4). In brief, gowns and gloves were never reused, but face shields and masks (either surgical or respirators) were safely removed, cleaned and stored for reuse throughout the day.\nPost-testing\nAt end of each testing day, blood samples in microtainers were stored upright in small cardboard specimen boxes, and viral transport media in biohazard bags was ideally stored upright as well. Specimens were transported to the lab each evening for accessioning overnight. Participants were counseled to expect PCR results within 3-7 days and antibody results within 4-6 weeks. Study staff planned to call each participant with a positive PCR result and direct their results to the Department of Public Health. Additionally, both positive and negative results were delivered via the same online platform through which participants registered. Participants received a text message or email with a code that allowed them to login to view their results. Alternatively, they had the option of calling a hotline for additional support.\nResults\nTesting site throughput\nIn total, 1,840 participants were tested over 4 days (April 20th - April 23rd, 2020) using this 4-lane drive-through or walk-up model. Seven participants received home-based testing on a supplemental 5th and final day of testing, to total 1,847 participants overall. As previously published, this represented estimated community ascertainment over 80 %.\nFewer participants were scheduled on the first day of testing to allow for study staff and volunteer acclimation to their roles. On Day 1, the fewest number of participants were tested (n = 338 participants), increasing to the highest number tested on Day 4 (n = 571 participants). Notably, performance on Days 2-4 reflects staffing described above, whereas there were fewer personnel available to staff the testing bays on Day 1.\nNumber of participants with onsite testing completed and logged (on the Y-axis) per hour of day (on the X-axis.) The testing site was fully open for appointments between 9am - 5pm.\nFigure 3 depicts the number of participants tested per hour across all lanes for each of the four days of onsite testing. When including the hours during which time the testing site was fully open for appointments (9am - 5pm), the median number of participants tested per hour onsite was 57 (interquartile range 47-67). The participants included in this analysis were 1,801 participants with time-stamped checkouts (compared to the total of 1,847), slightly underestimating actual throughput. \nDiscussion\n Using the aforementioned methods, we utilized close community partnership and a 4-lane, drive-through and walk-up model to test 1,840 participants for SARS-CoV-2 with both PCR and antibody testing in 4 days. Few methodologic papers have described detailed procedures in this way, but our reported throughput exceeds another study conducted early in the pandemic described testing 1,153 participants for SARS-CoV-2 with PCR only in 7 days. In addition to the identified areas for improvement below, an additional limitation of our methodologic reporting is the changing (and possibly diminished) utility of SARS-CoV-2 mass testing as the pandemic evolves. On the other hand, these methods will likely prove useful to those planning mass testing campaigns in the context of either emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants or other pandemics due to respiratory viral illnesses.\nIdentified areas for improvement\nWhile this was overall a successful endeavor, we faced a number of challenges that others may improve upon in the future. Our labeling system largely worked well when participants were pre-registered, but when participants registered onsite or identified an error in their name or date of birth, handwriting labels was both time-consuming and error prone. Possible improvements include using an onsite label printer along with a barcode scanner in each lane to automate this process as much as possible.\nAnother challenge was verification of participant identifiers when all parties were wearing masks and maintaining physical distancing. While tent supervisors emphasized ongoing closed-loop communication between team and participants, alternative strategies to verbal communication may offer an improvement. For example, test assistants could use a small white board to write participant identifiers and visually confirm these details with the participant and the administrator.\nFinally, despite quality control measures, a small number of viral transport media tubes leaked material upon receipt in the lab. As such, we recommend using tightly sealing vials, inspecting vials prior to testing and upright storage of samples in individual biohazard bags.\nAn additional suggestion would be to test the entire process in advance of testing roll out, from onsite registration to sample collection to lab reporting. Given the speed with which our efforts were planned, we were limited to testing of individual pieces of the protocol with a final &quot;dress rehearsal&quot; conducted just prior to opening. This issue could also be mitigated by having an experienced team performing the same operations in other locations. That said, our results demonstrate that even in face of rapid planning and new operational system development, we were able to successfully exceed our goals for testing.\nConclusions\nIn summary, high-volume, community-wide ascertainment of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence by PCR and antibody testing was feasible and could be performed successfully when conducted in a community-led, drive-through model, with minimal start up time. This operational model may be generalizable to those conducting any sort of high-throughput testing for SARS-CoV-2, regardless of sampling methodology.\nSupplementary information\nAbbreviations\nPCR\nPolymerase chain reaction\nHIPAA\nHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act\nCLIA\nClinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments\nQR\nQuick Response\nPPE\nPersonal Protective Equipment\nPublisher's Note\nSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.\nAuthors' contributions\nAA helped design the work, collected data, and primarily drafted the manuscript.

Introduction\nAfter the first reported case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hubei Province of China in December 2019, COVID-19 cases have been reported in most countries worldwide. The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, previously known as 2019-nCoV) has been rapidly spreading, with unprecedented propagation, because of its highly infectious nature. The World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic on 11 March 2020. The fatality rate of COVID-19 is 2-6% and is much higher in older populations and those with underlying diseases. The number of suspected or symptomatic individuals with COVID-19 is continuously increasing; hence, screening clinics, separated from other existing clinics, are being set up in several hospitals in each community.\nIn Daegu, South Korea, a rapid surge in COVID-19 cases occurred in late February and early March 2020. Over 5000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were reported during this period in Daegu. For efficient and safe screening, some hospitals in Daegu implemented a drive-through (DT) screening system. The individuals who used this system could provide a sample for SARS-CoV-2 testing without leaving their cars. We believe that this system is helpful for conducting rapid and safe testing during the current COVID-19 outbreak in Daegu. \nIn the current study, we evaluated the efficiency of a DT screening system for SARS-CoV-2 by comparing it with a conventional screening system. Moreover, we reviewed the results of SARS-CoV-2 screening (for samples collected via DT and conventional systems) in a single university hospital during the COVID-19 outbreak in Daegu, South Korea. \n2. Methods\nThis study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Yeungnam University Hospital, and the requirement for informed consent was waived by the Ethics Committee. We reviewed and analyzed the data of a SARS-CoV-2 screening clinic at Yeungnam University Hospital, Daegu, which is one of the four university hospitals in Daegu. The data were collected using a computerized system. At the time of patient examination, the staff input the data, such as the presence of COVID-19 symptoms and a history of contact with COVID-19 patients, into the hospital's computerized system. In addition, we described the details of the DT screening system and the conventional screening system and compared the two systems. This research was approved by IRB at Yeungnam University Hospital (2020-03-101).\n3. Results\n3.1. Operational Differences between the Conventional and Drive-Through Systems\n3.1.1. Conventional System\nThe conventional specimen collection system used a negative-pressure tent. The medical staff working in the temporary buildings wore personal protective equipment, including inner and outer gloves; an N95 respirator; an eye shield, a face shield, or goggles; a hooded coverall or gown. The outer gloves and disposable plastic apron (AP) gowns were changed after contact with every patient. The tent was divided into three sections:the section through which the individual to be tested entered (Section A), the section where the medical staff completed the questionnaires (Section B), and the section where the specimen for testing was collected (Section C) (Figure 1). When a testee entered the negative-pressure tent (Section A), the medical staff in Section B interviewed the testee. These two sections (A and B) were separated by transparent plastic. After completing the questionnaire, the testee moved to Section C, where the test specimens were collected. In Section C, three or four medical staff were waiting:one was responsible for collecting the payment for the test, one was responsible for specimen collection, and the others were responsible for sterilizing the space after the individual exited the tent. To prevent cross-contamination by testees, all sections, except Section B, were sterilized for at least 30 minutes before the next testee entered.\n3.1.2. Drive-Through System\nThe procedure for the DT specimen collection system was as follows: entrance, registration and questionnaire completion, examination, specimen collection, and receipt of instructions and information (Figure 2). For registration and questionnaire completion, examination, specimen collection, and receipt of instructions and the information leaflet, one temporary outside building was built for each section; therefore, four temporary buildings were built in total. One or two medical staff were present in each section and were completely isolated from the outdoor environment. The medical staff working in the temporary buildings wore personal protective equipment, including inner and outer gloves; an N95 respirator; an eye shield, a face shield, or goggles; a hooded coverall or gown. The outer gloves and disposable plastic apron (AP) gowns were changed after contact with every patient. In the registration and questionnaire section, the identification card of the testee was scanned and automatically transferred to the computerized system of the hospital to avoid direct contact with testees. In the registration and questionnaire and examination sections, microphones were installed inside and outside of the temporary buildings so that the medical staff could communicate with the testee without direct contact. In the specimen collection section, the driver opened the window of the car and collected his or her own specimen. In the instructions and information section, the medical staff provided information regarding when the results would be available through a microphone. The entire service could be provided to individuals without leaving their cars. Unlike conventional systems, the DT system did not require sterilization of spaces between testees, thus markedly reducing the preparation times. The total time spent on each testee was 5-7 min. Comparing the time taken for the COVID-19 test between the DT system (5-7 min) and conventional system (30 min), the DT system was 4-6 times more efficient than the conventional screening system.\n3.2. The Difference in Specimen Collection Ability between Drive-Through and Conventional Systems\nWe compared the number of specimens collected by the two different systems over a 14-day period (26 February 2020 to 10 March 2020), during which both systems were operating simultaneously. Through this, we aimed to indirectly compare the efficiency of the two systems. In the DT and conventional systems, the number of specimens collected per day were 241.7 and 41.4, respectively (3384 (DT system) vs. 580 (conventional system)). According to the total number of tests performed during the 14-day period, the efficiency of the DT system was 5.8 times higher than that of the conventional screening system. In addition, per test, the DT system was 4-6 times faster than the conventional system (5-7 min vs. 30 min). Because of the higher efficiency of the DT system, as of 11 March 2020, we stopped using the conventional system and used only the DT system to collect specimens for SARS-CoV-2 testing.\n3.3. Laboratory Data\nReal-time polymerase chain reaction (Allplex  2019-nCoV Assay, Seegene , Seoul, Korea) was used for SARS-CoV-2 testing. From 17 January to mid-February 2020, this test was performed in less than 10 individuals per day. The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported on 18 February 2020, and a gradual increase in the number of tests and confirmed cases followed. After the sudden outbreak of COVID-19 in Daegu, the number of tests, newly confirmed cases, and positive rate sharply increased. In mid-March 2020, 150-450 individuals were being tested for SARS-CoV-2 daily (Figure 3 and Table 1).\nIn total, 6211 individuals underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing. Overall, 5151 (82.93%) and 1060 (17.07%) individuals provided specimens through DT and conventional collection systems, respectively. Further, 217 individuals tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (positive rate: 3.50%). Of the 6211 individuals, 3368 were symptomatic or had a history of contact with COVID-19 patients, and 142 of them tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (positive rate: 4.22%). Further, 2843 patients were asymptomatic and had no history of contact with COVID-19 patients, and 75 of them tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (positive rate: 2.64%) (Table 2). A large number of individuals aged 20 to 59 years, &gt;1000 per age range, underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing, and the positive rate was 1.5-4.6% (Table 3). In contrast, a relatively small number of individuals aged 60 to 89 years underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing, but the positive rate was relatively high (6.8-14.0%). Of the 211 patients with positive test results, 89 (41.01%) were men, and 128 (58.99%) were women. \nDuring the 14-day period (26 February 2020 to 10 March 2020), when DT and conventional systems were administered simultaneously, 3964 individuals underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing. According to the screening system, the rates of positive test results were 4.11% (DT system) and 5.69% (conventional system). Of the 3384 individuals who used the DT system, 1812 (53.55%) were symptomatic or had a history of contact with COVID-19 patients, while 1572 (46.45%) were asymptomatic and had no history of contact with COVID-19 patients. Of the 580 individuals who used the conventional system, 332 (57.24%) were symptomatic or had a history of contact with COVID-19 patients, while 248 (42.76%) were asymptomatic and had no history of contact with COVID-19 patients (Table 4).\n4. Discussion\nFor managing pandemic diseases, such as COVID-19, not only accuracy but also the efficiency of diagnoses, such as the time taken to establish a diagnosis and the number of tests performed, are of utmost importance. Since SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible, rapid diagnosis and sufficient testing capacity are essential for the management of COVID-19. In our study, two specimen collection systems:conventional and DT:were examined. The DT system was approximately 9 times more efficient at collecting specimens for testing. These results suggested that the DT system was more efficient and useful for effective COVID-19 management. We believed that the wide-scale use of DT systems could significantly contribute to the efficient diagnosis of COVID-19. \nIn this study, positive results were seen in around 2.64% of asymptomatic individuals. These results supported that lack of symptoms should not be an indication of exclusion for SARS-CoV-2 testing. In other words, testing might be necessary during pandemics, even when if the patient is asymptomatic or has a history of contact with infected individuals. \nIn our study, we found that older individuals (aged &gt;= 60 years) had a lesser tendency to undergo screening than younger individuals (aged &lt;= 50 years). The positive test result rates were higher among individuals in their 60 s-80 s than among those in the lower age groups. Older individuals had a lesser tendency to undergo the COVID-19 test than younger individuals. This could be due to the fact that many older individuals are physically weak or cannot drive. To develop appropriate strategies for managing COVID-19, the government and clinicians must focus more on the older population, especially individuals aged &gt;= 60 years. \nDuring the study period, the number of tests and the cumulative number of positive patients began to increase exponentially from 20 February 2020. The main source of this rapid propagation was determined to be mass infection among a religious group (Shincheonji) in Daegu during a Sunday gathering. In this religious gathering, thousands of people were sitting close to each other in a confined space within the facility, having conversations, praying, and singing songs. The government had ordered screening tests for all the individuals in this group. Of them, 62% (&gt;2000 cases) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, throughout South Korea, mass infections occurring in churches, hospitals, nursing homes, and call centers were largely responsible for the increase in the number of COVID-19 cases. Therefore, during the COVID-19 outbreak, group meetings should be restrained, and measures should be implemented in facilities where many people are gathered to actively prevent further COVID-19 cases as SARS-CoV-2 has a high transmission rate.\nAs of 11 April 2020, the total positive test result rate for SARS-CoV-2 in South Korea was 2.05% (). This value was lower than the positive test result rate of our study (3.49%). This might be due to the fact that our hospital is located in Daegu, which was the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak in South Korea; as of 11 April 2020, around 65% of COVID-19 patients in South Korea were Daegu residents.\n5. Conclusions\nIn this study, we reviewed screening clinic data for SARS-CoV-2 in a single university hospital during the COVID-19 outbreak in Daegu, South Korea. The results of the analysis showed that the DT screening system was highly efficient. The DT system was a useful option for rapid and safe testing. Furthermore, our results showed a high positive test result rate in asymptomatic patients. Therefore, expanding screening tests to asymptomatic individuals might be necessary. Larger cohort studies analyzing data from multiple hospitals are warranted for acquiring more accurate information regarding SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. \nAuthor Contributions\nData curation, W.-S.S. and J.H.; Writing-original draft, M.C.C. and D.P.

Understanding the early transmission dynamics of the infection and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures is crucial for assessing the potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas.\n\n Combining a mathematical model of severe SARS-CoV-2 transmission with four datasets from within and outside Wuhan, we estimated how transmission in Wuhan varied between December, 2019, and February, 2020. We used these estimates to assess the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission to occur in locations outside Wuhan if cases were introduced.\n\n\nMethods\nWe combined a stochastic transmission model with data on cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan and international cases that originated in Wuhan to estimate how transmission had varied over time during January, 2020, and February, 2020. Based on these estimates, we then calculated the probability that newly introduced cases might generate outbreaks in other areas.\n\n To estimate the early dynamics of transmission in Wuhan, we fitted a stochastic transmission dynamic model to multiple publicly available datasets on cases in Wuhan and internationally exported cases from Wuhan.\n\n The four datasets we fitted to were: daily number of new internationally exported cases (or lack thereof), by date of onset, as of Jan 26, 2020; daily number of new cases in Wuhan with no market exposure, by date of onset, between Dec 1, 2019, and Jan 1, 2020; daily number of new cases in China, by date of onset, between Dec 29, 2019, and Jan 23, 2020; and proportion of infected passengers on evacuation flights between Jan 29, 2020, and Feb 4, 2020. We used an additional two datasets for comparison with model outputs: daily number of new exported cases from Wuhan (or lack thereof) in countries with high connectivity to Wuhan (ie, top 20 most at-risk countries), by date of confirmation, as of Feb 10, 2020; and data on new confirmed cases reported in Wuhan between Jan 16, 2020, and Feb 11, 2020.\nFindings\nWe estimated that the median daily reproduction number (Rt) in Wuhan declined from 2·35 (95% CI 1·15–4·77) 1 week before travel restrictions were introduced on Jan 23, 2020, to 1·05 (0·41–2·39) 1 week after.\n\n Based on our estimates of Rt, assuming SARS-like variation, we calculated that in locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan in early January, once there are at least four independently introduced cases, there is a more than 50% chance the infection will establish within that population.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur results show that COVID-19 transmission probably declined in Wuhan during late January, 2020, coinciding with the introduction of travel control measures.\n\n As more cases arrive in international locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan before these control measures, it is likely many chains of transmission will fail to establish initially, but might lead to new outbreaks eventually.\n\n\nFunding\nWellcome Trust, Health Data Research UK, Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, and National Institute for Health Research.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7158569","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Science ;, The Lancet Pub.

Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in

2020","abstract":"Background\nOn 07/02/2020, French Health authorities were informed of a confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus in an Englishman infected in Singapore who had recently stayed in a chalet in the French Alps.\n\n We conducted an investigation to identify secondary cases and interrupt transmission.\n\n\nMethods\nWe defined as a confirmed case a person linked to the chalet with a positive RT-PCR sample for SARS-CoV-2.\nResults\nThe index case stayed 4 days in the chalet with 10 English tourists and a family of 5 French residents; SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 5 individuals in France, 6 in England (including the index case), and 1 in Spain (overall attack rate in the chalet: 75%).\n\n One pediatric case, with picornavirus and influenza A coinfection, visited 3 different schools while symptomatic.\n\n One case was asymptomatic, with similar viral load as that of a symptomatic case.\n\n Seven days after the first cases were diagnosed, one tertiary case was detected in a symptomatic patient with a positive endotracheal aspirate; all previous and concurrent nasopharyngeal specimens were negative.\n\n Additionally, 172 contacts were monitored, including 73 tested negative for SARS-CoV-2.\nConclusions\nThe occurrence in this cluster of one asymptomatic case with similar viral load as a symptomatic patient, suggests transmission potential of asymptomatic individuals.\n\n The fact that an infected child did not transmit the disease despite close interactions within schools suggests potential different transmission dynamics in children.\n\n Finally, the dissociation between upper and lower respiratory tract results underscores the need for close monitoring of the clinical evolution of suspect Covid-19 cases.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7184384","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Oxford University

via a free drive-through screening event\n To the Editor:The lack of resources for and limitations placed upon testing for the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have been well documented. On March 12, 2020, the governor of Delaware declared a state of emergency with identification of the first local cases of COVID-19, which led to an increase in testing interest among the public. To offload emergency department demand, on March 13, Delaware's largest private not-for-profit healthcare system conducted a 1-day drive-through testing event.\nThe 4-hour event was held in a public space separate from the healthcare system's campuses. Staff wore appropriate personal protective equipment (gowns, gloves, and masks with eye protection). They changed gloves and performed hand hygiene between each participant. Participants remained in their vehicles and were registered utilizing paper forms. Insurance information was not collected. All were provided instructions regarding self-isolation until results were available. At the time, testing was only available via the state public health laboratory and was restricted to those demonstrating symptoms and having a defined risk factor, such as travel or contact with a known case. For this event, asymptomatic persons could not be tested, but risk factors were not required to be present. All specimens were sent to a reference laboratory (Viracor Eurofins, Lee's Summit, MO) and no other viral testing was performed. Negative cases were notified of their results by text, e-mail, or phone, according to their preference; positive cases were called, were provided with self-isolation and other instructions, and were reported to the Delaware Division of Public Health for follow-up.\nParticipants provided demographic information and attested to the following factors: (1) presence of symptoms: fever and/or chills, difficulty breathing, cough, or sore throat; (2) risk factors such as close contact with a known case or travel from an area with COVID-19 transmission during that period (eg, China, Italy, Iran, Japan, South Korea; Washington or New York); and/or (3) under self-quarantine or being monitored by a health department. Descriptive statistics examined the prevalence of demographic characteristics, clinical characteristics, and risk factors in this population, including chi statistics to assess bivariate associations. Analyses were conducted using Stata version 15.1 software (StataCorp, College Station, TX).\nWe screened 539 individuals; 2 results were invalid, leaving 537 individuals with completed testing. Table 1 reports the demographic and clinical characteristics of the positive cases and the total participant population. One-quarter of those tested reported only 1 symptom, while nearly half indicated having 2 symptoms. We detected no differences in symptoms or risk factor profiles by gender, age, or state of residence (all P &gt; .05).\nDemographic and Clinical Characteristics of 537 Participants in COVID-19 Drive-through Testing Event, March 13, 2020\nCharacteristic	Positive CasesN = 12	Total PopulationN = 537	 	No.	%	No.	%	 	Gender					 	 Female	5	41	306	56.9	 	 Male	7	58	231	43.0	 	Age, y					 	 0-9	0	0	17	3.1	 	 10-19	1	8	29	5.4	 	 20-29	1	8	83	15.4	 	 30-39	2	16	123	22.9	 	 40-49	2	16	91	16.9	 	 50-59	3	25	92	17.1	 	 60-69	3	25	72	13.4	 	 70-79	0	0	26	4.8	 	 &gt;=80	0	0	4	0.7	 	State of residence					 	 Delaware	8	66	407	75.7	 	 Other	4	33	130	24.2	 	Clinical symptom present					 	 Fevers/Chills	10	83	304	56.6	 	 Cough	9	75	428	79.7	 	 Difficulty breathing	2	16	174	32.4	 	 Sore throat	3	25	236	43.9	 	 1 symptom	3	25	128	23.8	 	 2 symptoms	6	50	240	44.6	 	 3 symptoms	3	25	126	23.4	 	 All 4 symptoms	0	0	43	8.0	 	Risk factor present					 	 Traveled to area with local transmission	1	8	67	12.4	 	 Close contact with a positive case	0	0	56	10.4	 	 Quarantined or monitored by health department	1	8	55	10.2	 	 No risk factors	10	83	379	70.5	 	 Only 1 risk factor	2	16	139	25.8	 	 2 risk factors	0	0	18	3.3	 	 All 3 risk factors	0	0	1	0.19	 	\nOf the 537 persons tested, we confirmed 12 positive cases, for a COVID-19 prevalence rate of 2.2%. Fever and/or chills were the most commonly reported symptoms, followed by cough, sore throat, and difficulty breathing. Of the 12 positive cases, 2 reported a positive risk-factor profile. There were no statistically significant differences in demographic characteristics or risk-factor profiles between positive and negative cases. Positive cases were more likely to report fever and/or chills than were negative cases (83% vs 56%, respectively; P = .05).\nThis drive-through event documented community transmission for the first time in our state. In the 2 months after the event was held (as of May 28, 2020), 9,096 additional positive cases were identified in Delaware, with numbers increasing daily. Public screening events, including drive-through testing, are effective strategies for identifying disease transmission and providing additional details on the ever-changing risk of COVID-19 to the community. \nThese events are also critical for identifying individuals at high risk for transmission, but they would not have been identified with the strict criteria used by the state and federal government at the time. Of the 12 positive cases identified, 1 was a teacher and 1 was a healthcare worker; neither qualified for testing by the state health department. Both individuals, if not identified, could have unknowingly infected many susceptible individuals. As our understanding of the disease deepens, it is critical to relax strict testing criteria to identify both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals who can unknowingly transmit this virus.\nEveryone tested at this event had at least 1 clinical symptom. Although fever and chills were more likely to be reported among cases than noncases, we detected no difference in the total number of symptoms reported between these 2 groups, with approximately one-quarter reporting 3 or more symptoms. Clearly, many other respiratory infections are cocirculating, although we did not conduct additional testing to confirm other pathogens. This highlights the ongoing challenge of differentiating COVID-19 from more common respiratory illnesses in the absence of widespread testing. As we enter the fall, officials estimate that we may see a second wave of COVID-19 occur simultaneously with other more common respiratory illnesses including influenza. Healthcare systems will need to prepare for the impact of this on hospital resources. Similar symptomology and a lack of testing will lead to challenges in differentiating COVID-19 from other respiratory illnesses.\nThis public event was free, financially supported by a private healthcare system, and set up in &lt;24 hours. The need for such an event to document community spread of COVID-19 speaks to the failure in the United States to support a public health system that could provide easily available testing to identify, isolate, and halt community spread of this highly contagious disease. Both private and public health systems need to work together to expand capacity for testing, enabling the public health system to perform the necessary isolation and contact tracing that are required to slow and eventually stop the continued spread of COVID-19.\nFinancial support\nThis study was funded by ChristianaCare, Wilmington, Delaware.\nConflict of Interest\nAll authors report no conflicts of interest relevant to this article.\nReferences\nDiagnostic testing for the novel coronavirus\nCountries test tactics in &quot;war&quot;

In this report, we share our team's development of a pediatric-focused drive-through COVID-19 testing center, and discuss how this process can inform future pediatric public health efforts.\nAlt-text: Unlabelled box\nIdentifying individuals infected by the novel coronavirus is critical to mitigating its deleterious effects. Challenges have arisen around how to test high volumes of patients while minimizing risk of disease spread. In this report, we outline our team's approach, process, and lessons learned in developing a pediatric-focused high-volume COVID-19 testing site in the United States.\nInnovation and Context\nMultiple COVID-19 testing models have been employed worldwide, including traditional send-out testing, walk-in sites, drive-through operations, and in-home testing. In early March 2020, providers in our health care system's primary care network used send-out orders because testing infrastructure and supply were limited. As testing demand increased, processing times spiked and throughput suffered, triggering the need for a more efficient model. Our physician leadership recognized that the 24-hour turnaround time on our system's in-house COVID-19 test would benefit the community and saw the opportunity to make it accessible quickly.\nHigh-volume testing in any format requires substantial planning and availability of materials and staff. Drive-through testing has several advantages: it promotes social distancing, prevents infectious individuals from entering an enclosed building, and offers efficiency and convenience to families. Our team, led by attending and resident pediatricians, nursing leadership, operations and facilities managers, hospital administrators, information technology (IT) specialists, and improvement advisors, set about developing a model for increasing volume and optimizing use of limited resources via drive-through (and walk-through) nasopharyngeal swab testing.\nOur target pediatric population included children referred by the Department of Public Health and by our system's primary care practices (via phone screening or in-person evaluation). Testing eligibility was based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines and providers' clinical judgment. Integral to our mission, we also prioritized testing employees in our system in an effort to return healthy individuals to work and limit risk of workplace transmission.\nProcess and Results\nOur pilot site was in the parking lot of an inner-city pediatric primary care clinic serving West Philadelphia. This location allowed physical separation between primary care and COVID-19 testing patients as well as 1-way traffic flow through the testing area. We created a &quot;fast lane&quot; for older children and employees who would likely tolerate testing easily, and a &quot;slow lane&quot; for cars with multiple young or potentially fussy patients. There was also a safe path for families without cars to access &quot;walk-through&quot; testing away from vehicle traffic.\nWith the site identified, improvement advisors and clinicians built a process map to illustrate traffic flow and staff roles. IT created electronic health record buildouts for clinician testing orders, referrals, and patient scheduling. The Infectious Disease and Infection Prevention &amp; Control teams optimized protocols for obtaining, storing, and transporting specimens. The Facilities Department was responsible for supply acquisition and on-site storage. Residents and Child Life Services created patient education handouts to help prepare families for testing.\nStaffing models and job aids were built for each role: 1) Wayfinders (resident physicians) directed vehicles and walk-through patients, offered patient information handouts, and answered clinical questions; 2) Swabbers (nurses) physically performed the test; and 3) Test Prep-pers (medical assistants) prepared swab kits.\nA high-fidelity simulation was performed before launch to ensure proper flow, staff proficiency in test administration, and adherence to personal protective equipment (PPE) guidelines. The clinic was launched March 18, 2020; days and hours of operation were updated daily based on demand. A second site was opened in suburban Philadelphia on March 23, 2020.\nStaff expected to be within 6 feet of patients were supplied daily with PPE (face shield, mask, gown, gloves) from existing hospital stock. Swabbers and any Wayfinders with patient contact wore a face shield, mask, gown, and gloves, and changed every 3 hours or sooner if soiled (gloves were changed before each patient). Test Preppers and other Wayfinders did not require PPE because they remained in the &quot;clean zone.&quot;\nDaily and cumulative test counts at Site 1. Cumulative tests performed during study period: 901. Cumulative positive test results: 77. Note that weekend scheduling availability was limited, resulting in low volumes on March 21 to 22 and March 28 to 29. Site 2 data not included as study time frame did not include the site at full ramp-up.\nFigure 1\nAge ranges of tested patients at Site 1 from March 18, 2020 to March 31, 2020. The high rate of tested patients over 18 years old in this initial phase of the testing site demonstrates the key impact of helping uninfected employees return to work. This may also demonstrate pent-up demand for employee testing for return to work, now able to be met at high volume by our drive-through site.\nFigure 2\n Figure 1 demonstrates that between March 18, 2020 and March 31, 2020, Site 1 completed 901 tests, ranging from 11 to 127 tests per day. This represents 9.7% of all tests performed in Philadelphia during that time. The positive rate was 8.5% compared to the citywide rate of 20%. During the study period, 26% of patients tested were under 18 years old, and the peak age range for tested patients was 30 to 39 years old, as shown in Figure 2 . Testing efficiency increased such that our team was swabbing two patients every 5 minutes.\nDiscussion\nIn this report, we discuss design and implementation of a high-volume COVID-19 drive-through testing model for children and pediatric health care workers. Our innovations allowed us to test patients rapidly, avoid long lines, conserve PPE, maintain excellent patient and family experience, and scale and reproduce the model to increase volume. Our age data suggest that our testing population included a significant portion of health care workers serving children, highlighting our critical contribution of helping healthy employees return to work.\n Testing children requires creativity and flexibility. For example, though most children tolerated in-car testing well, Swabbers' success and family experience were improved through creation of a &quot;hot zone&quot; for especially fussy or anxious children to sit in caregivers' laps for testing outside the car. Efficiency was maintained through the fast lane-slow lane setup.\n Site-specific knowledge is crucial. Clinic staff, redeployed to aid testing efforts, provided expertise on traffic burden, pedestrian flow, and unsecured entry points, essential in ensuring safety and efficiency.\n Change is a constant:and a strength. Workflow changed continually for the first several days as operations were streamlined and our team grew. Transparency about the need for flexibility and encouraging feedback and innovative thinking from each team member were critical.\n Create institutional memory. Leadership continuity was crucial during the first days as change occurred rapidly. Simultaneously, centralized training documents with roles and responsibilities were developed, updated frequently, and disseminated, facilitating onboarding of new team members.\n Unforeseen challenges arise. More than a week after launch, some families expressed concern about seeking pediatric care at the clinic abutting our testing site. In response, clinic leadership improved communication about the site during appointment reminders and via hold messages in the phone system.\n Trainees play a vital role. A flexible, knowledgeable, and ready workforce, resident physicians played a critical role in operationalizing the drive-through vision.\nAs we look to further applications of this model, we reflect on critical lessons learned: \nNext Steps and Conclusion\nWith multiple sites operational, we must now further improve access to COVID-19 testing. Along with increasing the number of sites, we hope to expand to groups not initially tested given resource constraints, including parents of pediatric patients and other workers who serve children, like education and childcare professionals. Considering health equity is also critical, lowering barriers to testing for children who have difficulty accessing health care more broadly.\nLessons from our experience will inform future initiatives. Should a vaccine against COVID-19 become available, our setup could easily pivot to administering immunizations. Furthermore, the ability to operationalize a testing site on short notice would be ideal for future COVID-19 outbreaks. If a COVID-19 outbreak co-occurs with influenza season, dual swab testing would be an important target for this model.\nOther than COVID-19, any disease with a spike in cases, such as a community measles outbreak or future novel pandemic, would be an excellent candidate for this model. Hospital leadership is already discussing using our model for influenza testing in our network this year; influenza vaccination for children and employees would also be well suited to this setup.\nSharing data, best practices, process flow maps, patient education handouts, and training guides is critical in helping pediatric health systems nationwide reduce administrative burden of opening testing sites and troubleshoot problems specific to pediatric testing. Ultimately, we hope that our process and lessons learned implementing a pediatric-focused drive-through testing site will not only inform similar efforts in the near term, but also serve as an approach for broader pediatric public health efforts in the future.\nReferences\nThe City of Miami Florida.
