The general principles regarding hip fracture care include careful assessment, prompt medical optimization, and early surgery to provide patients the best chance at recovery while minimizing the incidence of postoperative complications, morbidity, and mortality. In recent years, the population has been aging, and the incidence of hip fractures continues to increase. Often, older patients have a number of medical comorbidities that place them at increased risk when undergoing repair of hip fractures. Regardless of conditions, there continues to be a steady rate of elderly patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with a hip fracture.\nThe emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2; provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV disease (COVID-19)] in China at the end of 2019 has caused a large global pandemic and is a major public health issue. The virus is spread through droplet transmission and results in a flu-like upper respiratory illness with the symptoms of coughing, fever, and dyspnea in severe cases. The rate of spread throughout the world has been immense, and the lack of therapeutics for this new virus has led to a high mortality rate. In New York City, hospitals and EDs have been overwhelmed with cases. Health system resources have been redeployed to manage the crisis. Despite the reallocation of resources, patients with hip fractures have continued to present to the ED and require medical care.\nThe need for urgent orthopaedic surgical care in the setting of a global or regional epidemic or pandemic has not been studied in detail. The NYU Langone Orthopedic Department is responsible for the musculoskeletal care at 7 different hospitals within the New York City area and services a range of health care delivery systems. Our faculty and residents provide orthopaedic services at 1 tertiary care university hospital (NYU Langone Tisch/Kimmel); an orthopaedic specialty hospital (Langone Orthopedic Hospital); a New York City public hospital (Bellevue Hospital Center); a Veterans' Administration Medical Center (Manhattan VA); 2 safety net and level 1 trauma centers in the boroughs of Queens and Brooklyn (Jamaica Hospital Medical Center and NYU Brooklyn); and a large tertiary care, level 1 center in the suburbs of the city (NYU Winthrop). Each of these centers has restructured their medical operations to tackle the vast number of patients with COVID-19 who presented in the spring of 2020. Despite this fact, the department's orthopaedic trauma service has continued to provide care to all patients presenting with the diagnosis of a hip fracture.\nThe purpose of this report is to analyze the perioperative complication rate and inpatient hospitalization issues associated with hip fracture patients who presented during the global COVID-19 pandemic. We compared the results with a cohort of similar patients treated during the same seasonal period 1 year ago with respect to management and care of patients who presented to our EDs with a hip fracture.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nThis quality improvement IRB-approved study analyzed a consecutive series of patients with hip fracture who presented to the 7 EDs of 1 academic medical center between February 1, 2020, and April 15, 2020. Patients were included if they presented with a hip fracture (femoral neck (OTA/AO 31B), intertrochanteric (OTA/AO 31A), subtrochanteric, and periprosthetic (32(A,B,C).1)) and were treated during their index admission at one of our department's hospital sites (Fig. 1). Hip fracture diagnosis was confirmed on physical examination and with standard radiographs of the affected hip. During the pandemic period, each center had their own methodology and procedures for identifying and confirming COVID-positive patients, which changed over time. Hip fracture treatment was decided by the attending fracture surgeon and followed the general standard of care for patients with hip fracture. Hip fracture surgical care was performed according to standard techniques. Limiting room flow traffic and the use of negative pressure rooms and regional over general anesthetic techniques were implemented as available at each site as the breadth of the pandemic became clear. Personal protective equipment was available for all surgeons in all cases.\nCases in New York City and surrounding counties with NYU Langone Orthopedic treatment sites.\nPatient demographics, mechanism of injury, comorbidities, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), time between presentation and surgery, all laboratory values, oxygen requirements, and delivery methods (O2%, nasal cannula, continuous positive airway pressure, bilevel positive airway pressure, rebreather, and mechanical ventilation) were identified and recorded. We calculated the length of stay, recorded the operative procedure performed, and analyzed inpatient complications.\nPatients were identified as COVID positive (C+), COVID suspected (Cs), or COVID negative (C-). Patients were identified as C+ if they had a positive COVID-19 RT-PCR test before, during, or after (at rehabilitation) hospitalization for their hip fracture. Patients were identified as Cs if they presented with symptoms or imaging consistent with COVID-19 infection but had a negative COVID-19 RT-PCR test or if they were not tested, having presented before the implementation of routine testing for symptomatic patients in our health system (March 15, 2020). Other medical comorbidities were analyzed using the CCI. Procedures were divided into nonoperative, closed reduction and internal fixation, open reduction and internal fixation, and arthroplasty procedures. Major complications included acute renal failure, surgical site infection, urinary tract infection, acute anemia, sepsis, pneumonia, deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolus (DVT/PE), acute myocardial infarction, stroke, acute postoperative infection, decubitus ulcer, acute respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, and death. In-hospital mortality data were obtained.\nA second cohort of patients with hip fracture who presented to our EDs between February 1, 2019, and April 15, 2019 was recruited from another IRB-approved database. Similar data were obtained minus the laboratory values and oxygen requirements so that comparisons between the cohorts could be made based on the time periods in question. Analysis of descriptive statistics was performed to determine differences between expected and observed frequencies. Chi-square tests of association and independent-samples t tests were used to assess differences between the 2019 and 2020 cohorts and between C+, Cs, and C- cohorts. Factors associated with mortality and major complications were assessed using the bivariate regression Cox analysis. All analyses were completed with SPSS software, version 25.0 (IBM Corporation). All analyses were considered significant for P &lt; 0.05.\nRESULTS\n2019 Versus 2020 Cohorts\nBetween February 1, 2020, and April 15, 2020, 138 patients (63.8% women) with a mean age of 82.9 years (+-10.1) presented to one of our EDs and were diagnosed with a hip fracture. To assess the pandemic era cohort, we compared them with a second group of 115 patients with hip fracture who presented to the same EDs between February 1, 2019, and April 15, 2019. There were no differences between the groups with regard to demographics (age, sex, and race), body mass index (BMI), CCI, or mechanism of injury. The only difference found was a preponderance of femoral neck fractures in 2020 as compared to 2019 (Table 1). In addition, there were no differences with regard to time to surgery, surgeries performed for each fracture, type of anesthesia, and postoperative ICU/SDU admission. However, the mortality rates (30-day mortality was 12.3% in 2020 vs. 3% in 2019), length of stay, and complication rates observed in the 2020 cohort were significantly greater than those in the 2019 cohort (Table 1).\nDemographics, Injury Information, and Surgical Data for the 2019 Versus 2020 Cohort\nWith regard to operative treatment, 133 patients (96.4%) in the 2020 cohort underwent immediate operative treatment (Table 1). There were 5 patients (all C+) who initially did not undergo repair; 2 patients (1.4%) who were too sick to undergo surgery and died; 1 patient (0.7%) with a nondisplaced femoral neck fracture that displaced after 2 weeks and then underwent hemiarthroplasty; and 2 others (1.4%), 1 with a nondisplaced intertrochanteric fracture and 1 with a nondisplaced femoral neck fracture, who were successfully treated without surgery. No patients were treated without surgery in the 2019 cohort.\n2020 Cohort: C+ Versus Cs Versus C-\nOf 2020 cohort patients, 17 (12.3%) were confirmed C+ by testing and another 14 (10.1%) were suspected (Cs) of having had the virus based on clinical presentation, chest computed tomography findings, or treatment but were never tested or had a negative test at some point. The length of time from presentation to surgery was 1.4 days (+- 1.5 days); C+ patients did have a longer time to surgery than C- patients (Table 2). There were no demographic and injury characteristic differences between the C+, Cs, and C- groups (Table 2). When comparing the group of C+ and Cs with the C- hip fracture patients, we found greater in-hospital and 30-day mortality rates, a greater length of hospital stay, a greater major complication rate, and a greater incidence of ventilator need postoperatively (Table 3). In fact, 53% of C+ and 14% of Cs patients died by 30 days compared with 5.6% of C- patients. Complications were seen at a significantly higher rate in those with or suspected of having COVID than those not. The incidence of pneumonia (70.5% vs. 35.7% vs. 0.9%), respiratory failure (41.2% vs. 28.6% vs. 1.9%), sepsis (17.6% vs. 7.1% vs. 2.8%), and death (35.3% vs. 7.1% vs. 0.9%) was significantly elevated in the C+ group compared with the Cs and C- cohorts (Table 4).\nDemographics, Injury Information, and Surgical Data for the Three Cohorts of 2020 by COVID Status\nHospital Quality Measures in Three Cohorts From 2020\nInpatient Complications, Minor and Major\nIn an attempt to assess factors associated with a major complication in the C+/Cs group, we analyzed all laboratory values obtained on admission, postoperative day 1, and postoperative day 2 along with pre-existing medical conditions with those who sustained morbidity and mortality (see Table, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/JOT/B89, which describes the pre-existing medical conditions and laboratory values analyzed). Only one factor, postoperative day 1 white blood cell count, was associated with in-hospital major complications (IRR 5.586, CI 95% 1.21-25.786). None of these factors demonstrated an association with mortality; thus, the only predictor of death was C+ and Cs status. Furthermore, when we remove the C+ patients who were confirmed positive after discharge from analyses, the associations still hold (see Table, Supplemental Digital Content 2, http://links.lww.com/JOT/B90, which demonstrates analysis without C+ patients diagnosed after discharge).\nDISCUSSION\nWe found a significantly elevated risk of death after hip fracture in those with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection. In addition, these patients treated for a hip fracture during the COVID-19 pandemic were at risk for major postoperative complications compared with those who were C-, the historical control group, and patients with hip fracture in general. Patients treated in each of our institutions were optimized, and the great majority was treated expeditiously when possible. As with most, surgeons in our department continually placed patient care as a top priority. None of the patients' pre-existing conditions or laboratory values during admission were predictive of major complication or death.\nOrthopaedic surgeons are front-line health care providers. As first responders, orthopaedic trauma surgeons are called on to provide care for trauma patients and those subject to unanticipated fractures. Orthopaedic surgeons who take call do not have the luxury of being able to select their patients or being able to alter the present medical status of a patient in need of their care. In addition, they are susceptible to the contraction of contagious diseases. The risks to surgeons for blood-borne disease transmission are well known. Hepatitis and HIV transmission has always been of concern to orthopaedic surgeons involved in open, blood loss surgeries; however, the route of transmission of airborne or droplet-borne viruses poses considerable concern as well. Improperly protected surgeons are at risk for COVID transmission. Over a 1-month period, 26 orthopaedic surgeons tested positive for COVID-19 at 8 different hospitals in Wuhan, China. Eighty percent of exposures were felt to be on the wards and only 12.5% due to OR exposure, however.\nBecause the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a global surge in critically ill patients, hospitals were forced to reallocate resources, potentially resulting in reduced health care access for patients requiring essential care. Untreated hip fractures are associated with a high mortality rate, and even slight delays (&gt;72 hours) to operative fixation have been shown to increase morbidity and mortality. Therefore, patients presenting with fractures of the hip require timely surgical intervention regardless of their COVID status. Our cohort did not experience a delay to surgery when compared with accepted standards. However, the C+ group was delayed to surgery compared with the C- patients by 1 day. Whether this small delay to optimize these patients is the cause of the increased rates of postoperative mortality is unknown. It is generally accepted that the mortality rate after hip fractures is 9%-10% at 30 days and 25%-30% at 1 year. The exceedingly high mortality rate in the C+ patients warrants further investigation into ways to mitigate negative outcomes in this specific patient population. Male sex, older age, and higher CCI have all been associated with increased mortality after geriatric hip fracture. So, it was not surprising that our mortality rate was also male dominant. This may be related to the predominance of males affected by COVID-19.\nIn this cohort of patients, C+ and Cs patients experienced a greater overall major complication rate, including an increase in complications such as sepsis, pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, and inpatient mortality. They additionally experienced the minor complications of hypotension and atrial fibrillation at a greater rate than C- patients, but the overall minor complication rate was comparable between groups (Tables 3 &amp; 4). The increased frequency and types of perioperative complications observed in this cohort mirrors reports from other specialties. Lei et al describe a cohort of postoperatively diagnosed COVID-19 positive that underwent both orthopaedic and nonorthopaedic surgeries of various risk categories (low, mild, moderate, and high risk). All of these patients developed COVID-19-related pneumonia and experienced a 20.5% inpatient mortality rate. This mortality rate is lower than that described in our cohort, although patients underwent a variety of orthopaedic and nonorthopaedic procedures of varying risk, unlike our group who were all patients with hip fracture. Aminian et al report on 4 patients who underwent general and obstetric surgery (1 cholecystectomy, 1 hernia repair, 1 gastric bypass, and 1 hysterectomy) during the COVID-19 pandemic and developed perioperative complications; all 4 patients developed pulmonary compromise, which resulted in 3 deaths. While one can question why a hernia repair and gastric bypass were performed on patients with COVID-19, these previous reports enlightened us to the fact that perioperative patients are at heightened risk for complications due to COVID-19. A currently developing explanation for the damage caused by COVID-19 infection is a dysfunctional immune response accompanied by pulmonary and systemic inflammation. This, compounded with the secondary insult of anesthetic use and operative intervention, may have primed these patients for the pulmonary, vascular, and cardiac complications observed in this cohort.\nThe disease caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) results in acute respiratory failure accompanied by a severe hypercoagulability rather than consumptive coagulopathy. This hypercoagulability poses challenges for the postoperative hip fracture patients. DVT and venous thromboembolism are common in patients with hip fracture, and recent treatment algorithms have been instituted to both limit blood loss while preventing thrombotic events. One alteration of practice has been the discontinuation of tranexamic acid during arthroplasty in patients during the pandemic. In our current study, we observed no difference in the rate of venous thromboembolism in the C+ cohort compared with C- and historical controls. This could be due to the fact that all patients with hip fracture receive chemical prophylaxis that continues throughout hospitalization and for at least 1 month after injury, as opposed to the general population of patients presenting to the hospital.\nLimitations of this study include its retrospective design. Despite this, we have had a very active prospective trauma registry to capture all data prospectively. The data set is robust, but it is possible that some data are incomplete or missing. There were at least 12 different treating surgeons involved in the care of these patients. Patients were not treated as part of any protocol but rather individualized care provided, based on the clinical situation on the ground and the best care practices as decided by each surgeon. Guidelines and recommendations changed quickly as time went on over the 10 weeks studied. Although use of a Cs group of patients may be a limitation because we cannot definitively comment on their COVID-19 status, our purpose was to present the reader with all available data and allow them to make conclusions. Because the outcomes in the C+ group stand alone, we feel confident in reporting in this manner. Finally, long-term outcomes are not available at this time. It is possible that our mortality and major complication rate will continue to increase or that the numbers could change if C- patients converted to C+ postoperatively and were missed, thus lessening the differences between the 2 cohorts.\nIn conclusion, geriatric hip fractures continued to present to EDs throughout the COVID-19 pandemic period in New York City. Despite the incredible resource reallocation experienced by our hospital system, our treating orthopaedic surgeons continued to care for the elderly in need of essential surgery. Although there was some alteration in treatment algorithms, most patients were treated expeditiously and with great care. Despite this, we experienced an exorbitant rate of early mortality and major complications related to the pulmonary consequences of the virus in this population of patients. Physicians treating these COVID+ patients should counsel families of the significantly increased risks after hip fracture.\nAll authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest related to the content of this manuscript.

The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found

hospitalized cohort with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19.\nMethods\nPatients with COVID-19 admitted to 1 of 5 Mount Sinai Health System hospitals in New York City between February 27, 2020, and April 12, 2020, with troponin-I (normal value &lt;0.03 ng/ml) measured within 24 h of admission were included (n = 2,736).\n\n Demographics, medical histories, admission laboratory results, and outcomes were captured from the hospitals’ electronic health records.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age was 66.4 years, with 59.6% men.\n\n Cardiovascular disease (CVD), including coronary artery disease, atrial

diffuse alveolar damage with severe capillary congestion and variegated findings in lungs and other organs suggesting vascular dysfunction","abstract":"Aims\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID?19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS?CoV?2), has rapidly evolved into a sweeping pandemic.\n\n Its major manifestation is in the respiratory tract, and the general extent of organ involvement and the microscopic changes in the lungs remain insufficiently characterised.\n\n Autopsies are essential to elucidate COVID?19?associated organ alterations.\n\n\nMethods and results\nThis article reports the autopsy findings of 21 COVID?19 patients hospitalised at the University Hospital Basel and at the Cantonal Hospital Baselland, Switzerland.\n\n An in?corpore technique was performed to ensure optimal staff safety.\n\n The primary cause of death was respiratory failure with exudative diffuse alveolar damage and massive capillary congestion, often accompanied by microthrombi despite anticoagulation.\n\n Ten cases showed superimposed bronchopneumonia.\n\n Further findings included pulmonary embolism (n = 4), alveolar haemorrhage (n = 3), and vasculitis (n = 1).\n\n Pathologies in other organ systems were predominantly attributable to shock; three patients showed signs of generalised and five of pulmonary thrombotic microangiopathy.\n\n Six patients were diagnosed with senile cardiac amyloidosis upon autopsy.\n\n Most patients suffered from one or more comorbidities (hypertension, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes mellitus).\n\n Additionally, there was an overall predominance of males and individuals with blood group A (81% and 65%, respectively).\n\n All relevant histological slides are linked as open?source scans in supplementary files.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis study provides an overview of postmortem findings in COVID?19 cases, implying that hypertensive, elderly, obese, male individuals with severe cardiovascular comorbidities as well as those with blood group A may have a lower threshold of tolerance for COVID?19. This provides a pathophysiological explanation for higher mortality rates among these patients.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7496150","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley and Sons

Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Xiaobo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiqian","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huaqing","surname":"Shu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jia'an","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yongran","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lu","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhui","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Minghao","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yaxin","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shangwen","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaojing","surname":"Zou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shiying","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"You","surname":"Shang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.cmi.2020.07.049","date":"2020-07-16","title":"Clinical characteristics, management and in-hospital mortality of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 in Genoa, Italy","abstract":"Objectives\nTo describe clinical characteristics, management and outcome of individuals with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19);

health conditions of the residents and the movement of health care personnel among facilities in a region.\n\n\nMethods\nAfter identification on February 28, 2020, of a confirmed case of Covid-19 in a skilled nursing facility in King County, Washington, Public Health–Seattle and King County, aided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, launched a case investigation, contact tracing, quarantine of exposed persons, isolation of confirmed and suspected cases, and on-site enhancement of infection prevention and control.\n\n\nResults\nAs of March 18, a total of 167 confirmed cases of Covid-19 affecting 101 residents, 50 health care personnel, and 16 visitors were found to be epidemiologically linked to the facility.\n\n Most cases among residents included respiratory illness consistent with Covid-19; however, in 7 residents no symptoms were documented.\n\n Hospitalization rates for facility residents, visitors, and staff were 54.5%, 50.0%, and 6.0%, respectively.\n\n The case fatality rate for residents was 33.7% (34 of 101).\n\n As of March 18, a total of 30 long-term care facilities with at least one confirmed case of Covid-19 had been identified in King

analysis","abstract":"Background\nIn the face of rapidly changing data, a range of case fatality ratio estimates for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been produced that differ substantially in magnitude.\n\n We aimed to provide robust estimates, accounting for censoring and ascertainment biases.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected individual-case data for patients who died from COVID-19 in Hubei, mainland China (reported by national and provincial health commissions to Feb 8, 2020), and for cases outside of mainland China (from government or ministry of health websites and media reports for 37 countries, as well as Hong Kong and Macau, until Feb 25, 2020).\n\n These individual-case data were used to estimate the time between onset of symptoms and outcome (death or discharge from hospital).\n\n We next obtained age-stratified estimates of the case fatality ratio by relating the aggregate distribution of cases to the observed cumulative deaths in China, assuming a constant attack rate by age and adjusting for demography and age-based and location-based under-ascertainment.\n\n We also estimated the case fatality ratio from individual line-list data on 1334 cases identified outside of mainland China.\n\n Using data on the prevalence of PCR-confirmed cases in international residents repatriated from China, we obtained age-stratified estimates of the infection fatality ratio.\n\n Furthermore, data on age-stratified severity in a subset of 3665 cases from China were used to estimate the proportion of infected individuals who are likely to require hospitalisation.\n\n\nFindings\nUsing data on 24 deaths that occurred in mainland China and 165 recoveries outside of China, we estimated the mean duration from onset of symptoms to death to be 17·8 days (95% credible interval [CrI] 16·9–19·2) and to hospital discharge to be 24·7 days (22·9–28·1).\n\n In all laboratory confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases from mainland China (n=70?117), we estimated a crude case fatality ratio (adjusted for censoring) of 3·67% (95% CrI 3·56–3·80).\n\n However, after further adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment, we obtained a best estimate of the case fatality ratio in China of 1·38% (1·23–1·53), with substantially higher ratios in older age groups (0·32% [0·27–0·38] in those aged &lt;60 years vs 6·4% [5·7–7·2] in those aged ?60 years), up to 13·4% (11·2–15·9) in those aged 80 years or older.\n\n Estimates of case fatality ratio from international cases stratified by age were consistent with those from China (parametric estimate 1·4% [0·4–3·5] in those aged &lt;60 years [n=360] and 4·5% [1·8–11·1] in those aged ?60 years [n=151]).\n\n Our estimated overall infection fatality ratio for China was 0·66% (0·39–1·33), with an increasing profile with age.\n\n Similarly, estimates of the proportion of infected individuals likely to be hospitalised increased with age up to a maximum of 18·4% (11·0–37·6) in those aged 80 years or older.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThese early estimates give an indication of the fatality ratio across the spectrum of COVID-19 disease and show a strong age gradient in risk of death.\n\n\nFunding\nUK

identify distinct HRQoL trajectories and to evaluate the effects of two care models on these trajectories over 12 months following hip-fracture surgery.\n\n\nMethods\nFor this secondary analysis, data came from a randomized controlled trial of subjects with hip fracture receiving three treatment care models: interdisciplinary care (n?=?97), comprehensive care (n?=?91), and usual care (n?=?93).\n\n Interdisciplinary care consisted of geriatric consultation, discharge planning, and 4 months of in-home rehabilitation.\n\n Comprehensive care consisted of interdisciplinary care plus management of malnutrition and depressive symptoms, fall prevention, and 12 months of in-home rehabilitation.\n\n Usual care included only in-hospital rehabilitation and occasional discharge planning, without geriatric consultation and in-home rehabilitation.\n\n Mental and physical HRQoL were measured at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after discharge by the physical component summary scale (PCS) and mental

classification of the patients into the two groups.\n [Results]\nMultiple logistic regression analysis showed that the Functional Independence Measure\ncognitive score was a significant variable affecting the discharge destination.\n The\nreceiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that discharge to home was\npredicted accurately by a Functional Independence Measure cognitive score of 23.5.\n[Conclusion] Information from this study is expected to be useful for determining\ndischarge plans and for the setting of treatment goals.\n","id":"PMC4868217","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"The Society of Physical Therapy

Into Mortality Risk Assessment of a Middle-Aged and Geriatric Trauma Population?","abstract":"Introduction:\nFrailty in elderly trauma populations has been correlated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality.\n\n The Score for Trauma Triage in the Geriatric and Middle-Aged (STTGMA) is a validated mortality risk score that evaluates 4 major physiologic criteria: age, comorbidities, vital signs, and anatomic injuries.\n\n The aim of this study was to investigate whether the addition of additional frailty variables to the STTGMA tool would improve risk stratification of a middle-aged and elderly trauma population.\n\n\nMethods:\nA total of 1486 patients aged 55 years and older who met the American College of Surgeons Tier 1 to 3 criteria and/or who had orthopedic or neurosurgical traumatic consultations in the emergency department between September 2014 and September 2016 were included.\n\n The STTGMAORIGINAL and STTGMAFRAILTY scores were calculated.\n\n Additional “frailty variables” included preinjury assistive device use (disability), independent ambulatory status (functional independence), and albumin level (nutrition).\n\n The ability of the STTGMAORIGINAL and the STTGMAFRAILTY models to predict inpatient mortality was compared using area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCs).\n\n\nResults:\nThere were 23 high-energy inpatient mortalities (4.7%) and 20 low-energy inpatient mortalities (2.0%).\n\n When the STTGMAORIGINAL model was used, the AUROC in the high-energy and low-energy cohorts was 0.926 and 0.896, respectively.\n\n The AUROC for STTGMAFRAILTY for the high-energy and low-energy cohorts was 0.905 and 0.937, respectively.\n\n There was no significant difference in predictive capacity for inpatient mortality between STTGMAORIGINAL and STTGMAFRAILTY for both the high-energy and low-energy cohorts.\n\n\nConclusion:\nThe original STTGMA tool accounts for important frailty factors including cognition and general health status.\n\n These variables combined with other major physiologic variables such as age and anatomic injuries appear to be sufficient to adequately and accurately quantify inpatient mortality risk.\n\n The addition of other common frailty factors that account for does not enhance the STTGMA tool’s predictive capabilities.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5755843","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"SAGE Publications","authors":[{"firstname":"Sanjit

Lagos, Nigeria","abstract":"The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted global oxygen system deficiencies and revealed gaps in how we understand and measure ‘oxygen access’.\n We present a case study on oxygen access from 58 health facilities in Lagos state, Nigeria.\n We found large differences in oxygen access between facilities (primary vs secondary, government vs private) and describe three key domains to consider when measuring oxygen access: availability, cost, use.\n Of 58 facilities surveyed, 8 (14%) of facilities had a functional pulse oximeter.\n Oximeters (N=27) were typically located in outpatient clinics (12/27, 44%), paediatric ward (6/27, 22%) or operating theatre (4/27, 15%).\n 34/58 (59%) facilities had a functional source of oxygen available on the day of inspection, of which 31 (91%) facilities had it available in a single ward area, typically the operating theatre or maternity ward.\n Oxygen services were free to patients at primary health centres, when available, but expensive in hospitals and private facilities, with the median cost for 2?days oxygen 13?000 (US$36) and 27?500 (US$77) Naira, respectively.\n We obtained limited data on the cost of oxygen services to facilities.\n Pulse oximetry use was low in secondary care facilities (32%, 21/65 patients had SpO2 documented) and negligible in private facilities (2%, 3/177) and primary health centres (&lt;1%, 2/608).\n We were unable to determine the proportion of hypoxaemic patients who received oxygen therapy with available data.\n However, triangulation of existing data suggested that no facilities were equipped to meet minimum oxygen demands.\n We highlight the importance of a multifaceted approach to measuring oxygen access that assesses access at the point-of-care and ideally at the patient-level.\n We propose standard metrics to report oxygen access and describe how these can be integrated into routine health information systems and existing health facility assessment

of the weakest parts of health systems in low-income countries.\n\n We assessed the structure and availability of resources for Emergency and Critical Care in Tanzania in order to identify the priorities for improving care in this neglected specialty.\n\n\nMethods\nTen hospitals in four regions of Tanzania were assessed using a structured data collection tool.\n\n Quality was evaluated with standards developed from the literature and expert opinion.\n\n\nResults\nImportant deficits were identified in infrastructure, routines and training.\n\n Only 30% of the hospitals had an emergency room for adult and paediatric patients.\n\n None of the seven district and regional hospitals had a triage area or intensive care unit for adults.\n\n Only 40% of the hospitals had formal systems for adult triage and in less than one third were critically ill patients seen by clinicians more than once daily.\n\n In 80% of the hospitals there were no staff trained in adult triage or critical care.\n\n In contrast, a majority of equipment and drugs necessary for emergency and critical care were available in the hospitals (median 90% and 100% respectively.\n\n The referral/private hospitals tended to have a greater overall availability of resources (median 89.7%) than district/regional hospitals (median 70.6).\n\n\nConclusions\nMany of the structures necessary for Emergency and Critical

are potentially preventable, the basic, life-saving care of critically ill patients are often overlooked in health systems.\n\n Essential Emergency and Critical Care (EECC) has been devised as the care that should be provided to all critically ill patients in all hospitals in the world.\n\n EECC includes the effective care of low cost and low complexity for the identification and treatment of critically ill patients across all medical specialties.\n\n This study aimed to specify the content of EECC and additionally, given the surge of critical illness in the ongoing pandemic, the essential diagnosis-specific care for critically ill patients with COVID-19.\nMethods\nIn a Delphi process, consensus (&gt;90% agreement) was sought from a diverse panel of global clinical experts.\n\n The panel iteratively rated proposed treatments and actions based on previous guidelines and the WHO/ICRC’s Basic Emergency Care.\n\n The output from the Delphi was adapted iteratively with specialist reviewers into a coherent and feasible package of clinical processes plus a list of hospital readiness requirements.\n\n\nResults\nThe 269 experts in the Delphi panel had clinical experience in different acute medical specialties from 59 countries and from all resource settings.\n\n The agreed EECC package contains 40 clinical processes and 67 requirements, plus additions specific for

in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic","abstract":"Introduction\nThe COVID-19 pandemic will test the capacity of health systems worldwide and especially so in low- and middle-income countries.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the surge capacity of the Kenyan of the Kenyan health system in terms of general hospital and ICU beds in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\nMethods\nWe assumed that 2% of the Kenyan population get symptomatic infection by SARS-Cov-2 based on modelled estimates for Kenya and determined the health system surge capacity for COVID-19 under three transmission curve scenarios, 6, 12, and 18 months.\n\n We estimated four measures of hospital surge capacity namely: 1) hospital bed surge capacity 2) ICU bed surge capacity 3) Hospital bed tipping point, and 5) ICU bed tipping point.\n\n We computed this nationally and for all the 47 county governments.\n\n\nResults\nThe capacity of Kenyan hospitals to absorb increases in caseload due to COVID-19 is constrained by the availability of oxygen, with only 58% of hospital beds in hospitals with oxygen supply.\n\n There is substantial variation in hospital bed surge capacity across counties.\n\n For example, under the 6 months transmission scenario, the percentage of available general hospital beds that would be taken up by COVID-19 cases varied from 12% Tharaka Nithi county, to 145% in Trans Nzoia county.\n\n Kenya faces substantial gaps in ICU beds and ventilator capacity.\n\n Only 22 out of the 47 counties have at least 1 ICU unit.\n\n Kenya will need an additional 1,511 ICU beds and 1,609 ventilators (6 months transmission curve) to 374 ICU beds and 472 ventilators (18 months transmission curve) to absorb caseloads due to COVID-19.\nConclusion\nSignificant gaps exist in Kenya’s capacity for hospitals to accommodate a potential surge in caseload due to COVID-19. Alongside efforts to slow and supress the transmission of the infection, the Kenyan government will need to implement adaptive measures and additional investments to expand the hospital surge capacity for COVID-19.

for forward planning","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>Predicting hospital length of stay (LoS) for patients with COVID-19 infection is essential to ensure that adequate bed capacity can be provided without unnecessarily restricting care for patients with other conditions.\n\n Here, we demonstrate the utility of three complementary methods for predicting LoS using UK national- and hospital-level data.\n\n\nMethod\nid='Par2'>On a national scale, relevant patients were identified from the COVID-19 Hospitalisation in England Surveillance System (CHESS) reports.\n\n An Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) survival model and a truncation corrected method (TC), both with underlying Weibull distributions, were fitted to the data to estimate LoS from hospital admission date to an outcome (death or discharge) and from hospital admission date to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission date.\n\n In a second approach we fit a multi-state (MS) survival model to data directly from the Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust (MFT).\n\n We develop a planning tool that uses LoS estimates from these models to predict bed occupancy.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>All methods produced similar overall estimates of LoS for overall hospital stay, given a patient is not admitted to ICU (8.4, 9.1 and 8.0 days for AFT, TC and MS, respectively).\n\n Estimates differ more significantly between the local and national level when considering ICU.\n\n National estimates for ICU LoS from AFT and TC were 12.4 and 13.4 days, whereas in local data the MS method produced estimates of 18.9 days.\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par4'>Given the complexity and partiality of different data sources and the rapidly evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is most appropriate to use multiple analysis methods on multiple datasets.\n\n The AFT method accounts for censored cases, but does not allow for simultaneous consideration of different outcomes.\n\n The TC method does not include censored cases, instead correcting for truncation in the data, but does consider these different outcomes.\n\n The MS method can model complex pathways to different outcomes whilst accounting for censoring, but cannot handle non-random case missingness.\n\n Overall, we conclude that data-driven modelling approaches of LoS using these methods is useful in epidemic planning and management, and should be considered for widespread adoption throughout healthcare systems internationally where similar data resources exist.\n\n\nSupplementary Information\nThe online version contains supplementary

policy responses to COVID-19 in low-income and middle-income countries","abstract":"Objectives\nCOVID-19 has altered health sector capacity in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs).\n\n Cost data to inform evidence-based priority setting are urgently needed.\n\n Consequently, in this paper, we calculate the full economic health sector costs of COVID-19 clinical management in 79 LMICs under different epidemiological scenarios.\n\n\nMethods\nWe used country-specific epidemiological projections from a dynamic transmission model to determine number of cases, hospitalisations and deaths over 1?year under four mitigation scenarios.\n\n We defined the health sector response for three base LMICs through guidelines and expert opinion.\n\n We calculated costs through local resource use and price data and extrapolated costs across 79 LMICs.\n\n Lastly, we compared cost estimates against gross domestic product (GDP) and total annual health expenditure in 76 LMICs.\n\n\nResults\nCOVID-19 clinical management costs vary greatly by country, ranging between &lt;0.1%–12% of GDP and 0.4%–223% of total annual health expenditure (excluding out-of-pocket payments).\n\n Without mitigation policies, COVID-19 clinical management costs per capita range from US$43.39 to US$75.57; in 22 of 76 LMICs, these costs would surpass total annual health expenditure.\n\n In a scenario of stringent social distancing, costs per capita fall to US$1.10–US$1.32.\nConclusions\nWe present the first dataset of COVID-19 clinical management costs across LMICs.\n\n These costs can be used to inform decision-making on priority setting.\n\n Our results show that COVID-19 clinical management costs in LMICs are substantial, even in scenarios of moderate social distancing.\n\n Low-income countries are particularly vulnerable and some will struggle to cope with almost any epidemiological scenario.\n\n The choices facing LMICs are likely to remain stark

be effective with respect to functional recovery and mortality reduction.\n\n The aim of this study is to document the natural history of early multidisciplinary intervention in elderly patients with hip fractures and to establish the prognostic factors of mortality and walking ability after discharge.\n\n\nMETHODS:\nThis observational, retrospective study was performed in an orthogeriatric care unit on patients aged ?70 years with a diagnosis of hip fracture between 2004 and 2008. This study included 1363 patients with a mean age of 82.7±6.4 years.\n\n\nRESULTS:\nOn admission to the unit, the average Barthel score of these patients was 77.2±27.8 points, and the average Charlson index score was 2.14±2.05.

inadequately studied and epidemiological knowledge is scarce.\n\n Following the introduction of the Swedish Fracture Register (SFR), risk factors for various fractures can be studied, as well as the outcome of different treatments.\n\n The objective of this study was to analyse adult humeral fractures in Gothenburg from a descriptive epidemiological perspective.\n\n\nMethods\nAll humeral fractures registered in the SFR at Sahlgrenska University Hospital in 2011–2013 in patients aged???16 years were included.\n\n The fractures were divided into humeral segments (proximal, shaft and distal humerus) and analysed according to patient characteristics and patho-anatomical pattern.\n\n Furthermore, overall and age-specific incidence rates were calculated.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 2,011 humeral fractures were registered in the SFR, of which 79 % were proximal, 13 % shaft and 8 % distal humeral fractures.\n\n The mean age was 66.8 years and women ran a higher risk of humeral fractures than men (female/male ratio 2.4:1).\n\n On average, women were older than men at the time of fracture (mean age 70.1 years for women vs.\n\n 58.9 years for men).\n\n The overall incidence of humeral fractures was 104.7 per 100,000 inhabitants per year, with a segment-specific incidence of 83.0 for proximal fractures, 13.4 for shaft fractures and 8.3 per 100,000 person-years for distal fractures.\n\n There was a distinct increase in the age-specific incidence from the fifth decade and onwards, regardless of fracture site.\n\n Most fractures occurred in older patients (83 %?&gt;?50 years) as a result of a simple or an unspecified fall (79 %?&gt;?50 years).\n\n Only 1.2 % of all fractures were open injuries and 1.3 % were pathological.\n\n\nConclusion\nThis population-based study provides updated epidemiological data on humeral fractures in a Western-European setting.\n\n Most humeral fractures occur as the result of low-energy falls in the elderly population, indicating the influence of age-related risk factors in these fractures.\n\n The SFR will be a useful tool for providing continuous information on fracture epidemiology, risk factors and

fractures: mechanical complications, functional outcomes, and quality of life","abstract":"Background\nTrochanteric fractures are common fractures in the elderly.\n\n Due to characteristic demographic changes, the incidence of these injuries is rapidly increasing.\n\n Treatment of these fractures is associated with high rates of complications.\n\n In addition, the long-term results remain poor, with high morbidity, declines in function, and high mortality.\n\n Therefore, in this study, complication rates and patients’ outcomes were evaluated after fixation of geriatric trochanteric fractures using the Gamma3™ nail.\n\n\nMethods\nPatients aged 60 years old or older, with pertrochanteric and subtrochanteric femoral fractures, were included.\n\n Patients with polytrauma or pathological fractures were excluded.\n\n Age, sex, and fracture type were collected on admission.\n\n In addition, data were recorded concerning the surgeon (resident vs.\n\n consultant), time of operation, and local or systemic perioperative complications.\n\n Complications were also collected at the 6- and 12-month follow-ups after trauma.\n\n Barthel Index, IADL, and EQ-5D measurements were evaluated retrospectively on admission, as well as at discharge and during the follow-up.\n\n\nResults\nNinety patients were prospectively included between April 2009 and September 2010. The patients’ average age was 81 years old, and their average ASA score was 3. The incision/suture time was 53 min (95% CI 46–60 min).\n\n Hospital mortality was 4%, and overall mortality was 22% at the 12-month follow-up.\n\n Eight local complications occurred (4 haematomas, 1 deep infection, 1 cutting out, 1 irritation of the iliotibial tract, 1 periosteosynthetic fracture).\n\n The incidence of relevant systemic complications was 6%.\n\n Forty-two percent of the patients were operated on by residents in training, without significant differences in duration of surgery, complication rate, or mortality rate.\n\n The Barthel Index (82 to 71, p &lt; .\n\n001), IADL (4.5 to 4.3, p = .\n\n0195) and EQ-5-D (0.75 to 0.66, p = .\n\n068) values did not reach pre-fracture levels during the follow-up period of 12 months.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe results showed a relatively low complication rate using the Gamma3™ nail, even if the nailing was performed by residents in training.\n\n The high mortality, declines in function, and low quality of life could probably be attributed to pre-existing conditions, such as physical status.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3534554","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Benjamin","surname":"Buecking","email":"buecking@med.uni-marburg.de","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Christopher","surname":"Bliemel","email":"bliemel@med.uni-marburg.de","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Johannes","surname":"Struewer","email":"struewer@med.uni-marburg.de","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Daphne","surname":"Eschbach","email":"eschbach@med.uni-marburg.de","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Steffen","surname":"Ruchholtz","email":"ruchholt@med.uni-marburg.de","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Thorben","surname":"Müller","email":"thmuelle@med.uni-marburg.de","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Secular trend in the incidence of hip fracture in Catalonia, Spain, 2003-2014","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.bone.2009.11.024","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Incidence and seasonal variation in hip fracture incidence among elderly women in Norway.

register: no indication of different functional result","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>The Swedish Fracture Register (SFR) currently contains information on more than 190,000 fractures.\n\n Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) are used for monitoring functional results after fracture treatment.\n\n One weakness, as in many surveys, is a low response rate.\n\n The aim of the current study was to examine if non-responders of a survey in the SFR differ in PROMs scores, how age and gender influence the response rate and reasons for not responding.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>Patients with fractures of radius, ulna or humerus between June and August 2013 and registered in the SFR were included in the study.\n\n The non-responders to both the pre-injury and the 1-year survey were contacted by phone and reminded to reply.\n\n A comparison of the results of both EQ-5D and Short Musculoskeletal Function Assessment (SMFA) could be made between the responders after a phone reminder and the initial responders.\n\n The response rate for the register as a whole was extracted in order to identify how age and gender affect the response rate.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>Three hundred seventeen of the patients included in the study responded initially.\n\n After phone reminder another 94 patients answered the pre-injury survey.\n\n Two hundred sixty eight responded initially to the 1-year follow-up survey and 42 after phone reminder.\n\n No significant difference was identified in the score of the pre-injury survey between initial responders and responders after phone reminder neither in the EQ-5D nor in the Short Musculoskeletal Function Assessment (SMFA).\n\n Regarding the 1-year survey, responders after a phone reminder reported a significantly better outcome in crude data of SMFA score.\n\n This difference disappeared after controlling for confounding factors through case control matching.\n\n The highest response rate to PROMs in the SFR was among females in the age range 60–69 years.\n\n\nConclusion\nid='Par4'>This study indicates that both in the preinjury survey as well as in the 1-year survey the non-responders in the SFR report similar function compared to the initial responders.\n\n Age and gender of patients affect the response rate of the survey which needs to be taken into consideration in analysis of data from the

providing appropriate data for research and quality registers.\n\n In the Swedish Fracture Register (SFR) fractures of all types are registered by the attending physician, often a junior doctor.\n\n For the majority of fractures, a modified AO/OTA classification is used.\n\n This study aimed to validate the accuracy of classification of humerus fractures in the SFR and also at providing insight into inherent classification uncertainties.\n\n\nMethods\nOne hundred and sixteen humerus fractures (among them 90 proximal) were retrieved by computer randomisation from the SFR and reassessed independently at two occasions, 6 weeks apart, by three senior orthopaedic surgeons blinded to patient information and a consensus “gold standard” classification was established.\n\n This was compared with the classifications that had been entered into the register.\n\n\nResults\nThe agreement between gold standard classification and original classification in the SFR was kappa = 0.57 for all humerus fractures.\n\n For proximal humerus fractures kappa-coefficient for intra-observer agreement was 0.593, 0.599 and 0.752 for the three observers respectively.\n\n Taking into account the similarities between certain fracture groups, a modified calculation of agreement was performed.\n\n With this modification the intra-observer agreement was 0.910-0.974 and inter-observer agreement was 0.912.\nConclusion\nThe classification of humerus fractures in the Swedish Fracture Register was just as accurate as in previous studies, i.\n\ne.\n\n moderate as defined by Landis and Koch.\n\n However, when we introduced a modified analysis, that takes into account the similarities between certain fractures, the accuracy was “near

family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission,

priming by host cell proteases.\n Unravelling which cellular factors are used by SARS-CoV-2 for entry might provide insights into viral transmission and reveal therapeutic targets.\n Here, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 uses the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 for entry and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming.\n A TMPRSS2 inhibitor approved for clinical use blocked entry and might

Immune Response through Disruption of STING-Mediated Signaling","abstract":"Viruses have evolved elaborate mechanisms to evade or inactivate the complex system of sensors and signaling molecules that make up the host innate immune response.\n Here we show that human coronavirus (HCoV) NL63 and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) CoV papain-like proteases (PLP) antagonize innate immune signaling mediated by STING (stimulator of interferon genes, also known as MITA/ERIS/MYPS).\n STING resides in the endoplasmic reticulum and upon activation, forms dimers which assemble with MAVS, TBK-1 and IKK?, leading to IRF-3 activation and subsequent induction of interferon (IFN).\n We found that expression of the membrane anchored PLP domain from human HCoV-NL63 (PLP2-TM) or SARS-CoV (PLpro-TM) inhibits STING-mediated activation of IRF-3 nuclear translocation and induction of IRF-3 dependent promoters.\n Both catalytically active and inactive forms of CoV PLPs co-immunoprecipitated with STING, and viral replicase proteins co-localize with STING in HCoV-NL63-infected cells.\n Ectopic expression of catalytically active PLP2-TM blocks STING dimer formation and negatively regulates assembly of STING-MAVS-TBK1/IKK? complexes required for activation of IRF-3. STING dimerization was also substantially reduced in cells infected with SARS-CoV.\n Furthermore, the level of ubiquitinated forms of STING, RIG-I, TBK1 and IRF-3 are reduced in cells expressing wild type or catalytic mutants of PLP2-TM, likely contributing to disruption of signaling required for IFN induction.\n These results describe a new mechanism used by CoVs in which CoV PLPs negatively regulate antiviral defenses by disrupting the STING-mediated IFN induction.\n","id":"PMC3270028","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

previously described human coronaviruses, 229E and OC43. 229E was previously shown to productively infect human monocytes/macrophages, whereas OC43 poorly infected the cells.\n In this study, we examined whether SARS-CoV could productively infect purified monocytes/macrophages (PM) derived from human donor cells.\n Unlike 229E-infected cells, which produced viral titers of 103.5 to 106 TCID50/ml, SARS-CoV replicated poorly in PM, producing titers of 101.75 to 102 TCID50/ml.\n This finding was similar to results reported for OC43-infected cells, with titers ranging from 101.2 to 102.7 TCID50/ml.\n Of interest, SARS-CoV proteins were detected only in PM that did not produce significant amounts of interferon (IFN)-?, and in one such case, preliminary electron microscope studies demonstrated that SARS-CoV-like particles could enter the cells, possibly via phagocytosis.\n These results suggest that SARS-CoV, like human CoV OC43, poorly infects human PM, and production of IFN-? by these cells further limits the infection.\n Given the importance of monocytes/macrophages to the immune response, it is possible that their infection by SARS-CoV and alteration of this infection by IFN-? may be important to the course of the infection in humans.\n","id":"PMC7114182","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

We propose that the immunomodulatory effect of hydroxychloroquine also may be useful in controlling the cytokine storm that occurs late-phase in critically ill SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.\n\n Currently, there is no evidence to support the use of hydroxychloroquine in SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n\nMethods\nThe pharmacological activity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine was tested using SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero cells.\n\n Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models (PBPK) were implemented for both drugs separately by integrating their in vitro data.\n\n Using the PBPK models, hydroxychloroquine concentrations in lung fluid were simulated under 5 different dosing regimens to explore the most effective regimen whilst considering the drug’s safety profile.\n\n\nResults\nHydroxychloroquine (EC50=0.72 ?M) was found to be more potent than chloroquine (EC50=5.47 ?M) in vitro.\n\n Based on PBPK models results, a loading dose of 400 mg twice daily of hydroxychloroquine sulfate given orally, followed by a maintenance dose of 200 mg given twice daily for 4 days is recommended for SARS-CoV-2 infection, as it reached three times the potency of

although it is much needed for patient contracting the severe form of the disease.\n\n The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the evidence regarding chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19.\nMethods\nPubMed, EMBASE, and three trial Registries were searched for studies on the use of chloroquine in patients with COVID-19.\nResults\nWe included six articles (one narrative letter, one in-vitro study, one editorial, expert consensus paper, two national guideline documents) and 23 ongoing clinical trials in China.\n\n Chloroquine seems to be effective in limiting the replication of SARS-CoV-2 (virus causing COVID-19) in vitro.\n\n\nConclusions\nThere is rationale, pre-clinical evidence of effectiveness and evidence of safety from long-time clinical use for other indications to justify clinical research on chloroquine in patients with COVID-19. However, clinical use should either adhere to the Monitored Emergency Use of Unregistered Interventions (MEURI) framework or be ethically approved as a trial as stated by the World Health

peripheral blood samples from 27 hospitalized patients recruited during the epidemic that occurred in 2015 in South Korea.\n\n Plasma cytokines/chemokines and antibodies were quantified.\n\n Virus-specific T cells were examined by intracellular cytokine staining after stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with overlapping peptides spanning whole virus structural

high frequencies of MERS coronavirus–reactive CD8+ T cells were also observed in patients with severe/moderate illness, whereas antibody and CD4+ T-cell responses were minimally detected at this

SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) replication in the respiratory tract and are available in sufficient numbers for statistical evaluation.\n They are relatively inexpensive and easily accessible, but their use in SARS research is limited because they do not develop illness following infection.\n Older (12- to 14-mo-old) BALB/c mice develop clinical illness and pneumonitis, but they can be hard to procure, and immune senescence complicates pathogenesis studies.\n We adapted the SARS-CoV (Urbani strain) by serial passage in the respiratory tract of young BALB/c mice.\n Fifteen passages resulted in a virus (MA15) that is lethal for mice following intranasal inoculation.\n Lethality is preceded by rapid and high titer viral replication in lungs, viremia, and dissemination of virus to extrapulmonary sites accompanied by lymphopenia, neutrophilia, and pathological changes in the lungs.\n Abundant viral antigen is extensively distributed in bronchial epithelial cells and alveolar pneumocytes, and necrotic cellular debris is present in airways and alveoli, with only mild and focal pneumonitis.\n These observations suggest that mice infected with MA15 die from an overwhelming viral infection with extensive, virally mediated destruction of pneumocytes and ciliated epithelial cells.\n The MA15 virus has six coding mutations associated with adaptation and increased virulence; when introduced into a recombinant SARS-CoV, these mutations result in a highly virulent and lethal virus (rMA15), duplicating the phenotype of the biologically derived MA15 virus.\n Intranasal inoculation with MA15 reproduces many aspects of disease seen in severe human cases of SARS.\n The availability of the MA15 virus will enhance the use of the mouse model for SARS because infection with MA15 causes morbidity, mortality, and pulmonary pathology.\n This virus will be of value as a stringent challenge in evaluation of the efficacy of vaccines and

SARS-CoV Bearing Epidemic and Zoonotic Spike Variants ","abstract":"Background\nIn 2003, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identified as the etiological agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome, a disease characterized by severe pneumonia that sometimes results in death.\n\n SARS-CoV is a zoonotic virus that crossed the species barrier, most likely originating from bats or from other species including civets, raccoon dogs, domestic cats, swine, and rodents.\n\n A SARS-CoV vaccine should confer long-term protection, especially in vulnerable senescent populations, against both the 2003 epidemic strains and zoonotic strains that may yet emerge from animal reservoirs.\n\n We report the comprehensive investigation of SARS vaccine efficacy in young and senescent mice following homologous and heterologous challenge.\n\n\nMethods and Findings\nUsing Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicon particles (VRP) expressing the 2003 epidemic Urbani SARS-CoV strain spike (S) glycoprotein (VRP-S) or the nucleocapsid (N) protein from the same strain (VRP-N), we demonstrate that VRP-S, but not VRP-N vaccines provide complete short- and long-term protection against homologous strain challenge in young and senescent mice.\n\n To test VRP vaccine efficacy against a heterologous SARS-CoV, we used phylogenetic analyses, synthetic biology, and reverse genetics to construct a chimeric virus (icGDO3-S) encoding a synthetic S glycoprotein gene of the most genetically divergent human strain, GDO3, which clusters among the zoonotic SARS-CoV.\n\n icGD03-S replicated efficiently in human airway epithelial cells and in the lungs of young and senescent mice, and was highly resistant to neutralization with antisera directed against the Urbani strain.\n\n Although VRP-S vaccines provided complete short-term protection against heterologous icGD03-S challenge in young mice, only limited protection was seen in vaccinated senescent animals.\n\n VRP-N vaccines not only failed to protect from homologous or heterologous challenge, but resulted in enhanced immunopathology with eosinophilic infiltrates within the lungs of SARS-CoV–challenged mice.\n\n VRP-N–induced pathology presented at day 4, peaked around day 7, and persisted through day 14, and was likely mediated by cellular immune responses.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis study identifies gaps and challenges in vaccine design for controlling future SARS-CoV zoonosis, especially in vulnerable elderly populations.\n\n The availability of a SARS-CoV virus bearing heterologous S glycoproteins provides a robust challenge inoculum for evaluating vaccine efficacy against zoonotic strains, the most likely source of future outbreaks.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1716185","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public

days after illness onset, while S5 was recognized at a later stage.\n Furthermore, the result of recombinant-protein-based WB showed a 90% agreement with that of the whole-virus-based

However, the structural basis of RBD immunogenicity, RBD-mediated neutralization, and the role of RBD in entry steps following its binding to ACE2 have not been elucidated.\n By mimicking immune responses with the use of RBD as an antigen to screen a large human antibody library derived from healthy volunteers, we identified a novel potent cross-reactive SCV-neutralizing monoclonal antibody, m396, which competes with ACE2 for binding to RBD, and determined the crystal structure of the RBD-antibody complex at 2.3-Ä resolution.\n The antibody-bound RBD structure is completely defined, revealing two previously unresolved segments (residues 376–381 and 503–512) and a new disulfide bond (between residues 378 and 511).\n Interestingly, the overall structure of the m396-bound RBD is not significantly different from that of the ACE2-bound RBD.\n The antibody epitope is dominated by a 10-residue-long protruding ?6–?7 loop with two putative ACE2-binding hotspot residues (Ile-489 and Tyr-491).\n These results provide a structural rationale for the function of a major determinant of SCV immunogenicity and neutralization, the development of SCV therapeutics based on the antibody paratope and epitope, and a retrovaccinology approach for the design of anti-SCV vaccines.\n The available structural information indicates that the SCV entry may not be mediated by ACE2-induced conformational changes in the RBD but may involve other conformational changes or/and yet to be identified coreceptors.\n","id":"PMC8099238","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"ASBMB.

Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.\n\n\nFindings\n191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital.\n\n 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients).\n\n Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·03–1·17, per year increase; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·61–12·23; p&lt;0·0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL (18·42, 2·64–128·55; p=0·0033) on admission.\n\n Median duration of viral shedding was 20·0 days (IQR 17·0–24·0) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors.\n\n The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage.\n\n Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.\n\n\nFunding\nChinese Academy of Medical Sciences Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences; National Science Grant for Distinguished Young Scholars; National Key

COVID-19 put unprecedented pressure on the health care system of New York because hospitals diverted substantial human and physical resources to meet rising critical care demands. In particular, many resources normally used to provide orthopaedic care were repurposed, including anesthesia providers, operative and nursing staff, operating rooms, and postanesthesia care units. These reallocations limited the capacity of many hospitals to continue providing urgent orthopaedic care. Therefore, nonessential orthopaedic care was deferred, and essential care required new pathways established to transfer patients with essential urgent orthopaedic conditions to specific centers that were equipped to continue providing orthopaedic care during the pandemic.\nElderly patients with hip fractures were considered to have essential orthopaedic needs and represented a particularly challenging patient population in this context. Patients with hip fractures typically have a high comorbidity burden, thereby increasing their risk of morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19. Furthermore, patients with hip fractures are at increased risk of developing nosocomial pulmonary infection because of the need for hospitalization and limited ambulatory capacity. Several unique considerations arose in the context of caring for patients with hip fracture in New York City during the pandemic. These included regular transfer of patients between hospitals, minimizing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure in patients who did not present with COVID-19 infection, stabilizing patients preoperatively who were acutely ill due to COVID-19, and intervening promptly to minimize mortality and potentially improve the respiratory capacity of affected patients.\nTwo recent studies from China and Italy described the clinical characteristics of fracture patients with COVID-19 infection. These studies highlighted the high comorbidity burden and poor prognosis of this group. However, these studies were descriptive case series that did not compare patients with COVID-19 to those without COVID-19. A more recent study from Spain found a mortality rate of 30.4% in patients with hip fractures who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 compared with 5.3% in those testing negative or not tested. In light of these recent studies, the purpose of this study was to provide further assessment of hip fracture outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, with a focus on identifying differences in mortality and complications among COVID-positive (COVID+) patients relative to those who were not COVID-positive.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nStudy Design and Setting\nA multicenter retrospective cohort study was conducted to evaluate outcomes in patients older than 65 years of age with hip fractures (OTA/AO 31, 32.1) treated during the COVID-19 pandemic. A descriptive case series was also performed to evaluate trends in the inflammatory response among patients with hip fracture during the perioperative phase of care. Findings were reported in accordance with the STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) checklist for retrospective cohort studies.\nAll patients with hip fractures (OTA/AO 31, 32.1) admitted to 1 of 2 hospitals in New York City over a 5-week period from March 20, 2020, to April 25, 2020, were identified retrospectively. March 20, 2020, was chosen as the start date because this was the first date an orthopaedic patient was tested for SARS-CoV-2 at one of the hospitals. One of the hospitals is a Level 1 trauma center, and one of the hospitals is an orthopaedic specialty hospital without an emergency department. In the setting of the pandemic, the Level I trauma center became overburdened with the management of patients with COVID-19, as their operating rooms were largely converted to intensive care units (ICUs) and their anesthesia providers and operative staff were diverted to critical care roles. In this context, the roles of the 2 hospitals changed substantially with regard to managing acute orthopaedic trauma, with operative injuries being routinely transferred from the emergency department at the trauma center (as well as other hospitals throughout New York) directly to the orthopaedic specialty hospital, which was equipped to provide essential orthopaedic care during the pandemic. Therefore, patients presenting with hip fractures to both hospitals were included in this study.\nExcluded from the study were patients with high-energy trauma, periprosthetic fracture, pathologic fracture, age less than 65 years, or revision surgery for prior hip fracture.\nPatients were stratified into COVID+ and non-COVID cohorts based on SARS-CoV-2 testing status (positive, negative, or not tested). Patients in the COVID+ and non-COVID groups were compared in the primary analysis. Patients who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 but were &quot;presumptive positive&quot; as documented by hospitalist evaluation were incorporated into a secondary analysis, which included &quot;presumptive positive&quot; patients in the COVID+ group. This was performed to account for the limited sensitivity of the real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2 virus in patients with a high pretest probability of COVID infection.\nOutcomes\nThe primary outcome was inpatient mortality. Secondary outcomes were complications and unexpected pulmonary conditions and included documented neurovascular injury, hematoma, superficial or deep infection, wound dehiscence, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, pneumonia from any cause, cerebral vascular accident, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmia, urinary tract infection, blood transfusion, decubitus ulcer, admission to the ICU, and respiratory distress requiring intubation.\nCovariates\nDemographic, clinical, and functional variables were extracted from the electronic medical record, including age at presentation, sex, body mass index, baseline domicile, ambulatory status, comorbidities, smoking status, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, and the calculated Charlson Comorbidity Index. Variables related to the timing of care were also collected, including presentation delay (number of days from injury to the first presentation to any hospital), treatment delay (number of hours from the first presentation to any hospital to the time of surgery), and whether the patient required a transfer from a hospital or outpatient/urgent care center. Variables related to the injury and surgery were collected, including fracture type, mechanism of injury, laterality, fixation method, surgical duration, and anesthesia type. Postoperative ambulation, length of stay, and discharge disposition were also assessed.\nFor all patients, COVID-related data points were collected, including SARS-CoV-2 testing status, preoperative and postoperative COVID-related symptomatology, laboratory test results, and imaging results. COVID-related symptoms included new-onset cough, dyspnea, anosmia, fever (&gt;38 C), and new oxygen requirement. Preoperative and postoperative laboratory test results were also compared between COVID-positive and non-COVID groups.\nPatient Characteristics\nSixty-three patients with proximal femur fractures were initially screened, yielding 59 patients for inclusion in the study sample. Patients were excluded for the following reasons: periprosthetic fracture (n = 3) and revision surgery for prior hip fracture (n = 1). Nine of the 59 (15%) patients had a positive result on SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal rRT-PCR. In most COVID+ patients, their status was known preoperatively (7 of 9, 78%). Forty patients tested negative and 16 were not tested. Details of the timing, preoperative or postoperative, are presented in Table 1. Of 40 patients who tested negative preoperatively, 7 underwent a second test postoperatively and 1 tested positive. This patient was considered positive for all analyses. Therefore, 9 patients were considered in the COVID+ group and 50 patients were considered in the non-COVID group for the primary analysis. One patient who tested negative postoperatively was considered in a secondary analysis as &quot;presumptive positive&quot; because of documentation in the electronic medical record of COVID-related death, despite a negative test earlier in his/her hospitalization.\nSARS-CoV-2 Nasopharyngeal RT-PCR Testing Results Among the Study Sample\nStatistical Analysis\nPatient characteristics between the 2 cohorts were compared using the Fisher exact test for categorical variables and the t test and Cohen's d or the Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous parametric or nonparametric variables, respectively. Normality was assessed with the Shapiro-Wilks test. Inpatient mortality and complications were analyzed through univariate logistic regression. Data are presented as mean (SD) if they are normally distributed, as median (first quartile, third quartile) if they are not normally distributed, and as a count (percentage) if they are categorical. Given that all covariates and outcomes assessed were documented as the standard of care in the electronic medical record, there were minimal missing data (&lt;5%) for all demographic and clinical characteristics. Patients missing laboratory values were excluded from the analysis of the laboratory data. A 2-sided P value of &lt;0.05 was used. R statistical software (Vienna, Austria) was used for statistical analysis.\nEthical Approval\nThe study was approved by the institutional review boards of both hospitals under study.\nRESULTS\nComparison of Demographics and Fractures\nBaseline demographic characteristics were similar between the study groups (Table 2). The majority of patients were women (n = 44; 75%), and the mean age was 85 years (range 65-100 years). ASA scores were worse in the COVID+ group (d = -0.83; P = 0.04); however, the Charlson Comorbidity Index was similar between the study groups (d = -0.17; P = 0.71).\nClinical and Demographic Characteristics of the Study Sample\nFracture and treatment characteristics were similar between the study groups (Table 3). The most common fracture type was a 2- or 3-part intertrochanteric fracture with an intact lateral wall (31A1.2 and 31A1.3) (n = 24; 41%). The most common surgical procedure was placement of a cephalomedullary nail (n = 36; 61%).\nFracture and Treatment Characteristics of the Study Sample\nCOVID-Related Presentation\nCOVID+ patients were more likely to present with preoperative hypoxia requiring supplemental oxygen (44% vs. 6%; P = 0.008) (Table 4). Radiographic evidence of atypical pneumonia (eg, bilateral interstitial infiltrates) on presentation was seen in 4 (44%) of the COVID-positive patients, 1 of whom was asymptomatic. In addition, radiographic evidence of atypical pneumonia was seen in 4 asymptomatic individuals who tested negative and 2 asymptomatic individuals who were not tested.\nPreoperative and Postoperative Signs, Symptoms, and Imaging Results\nMortality\nOverall, inpatient mortality was 11.9%. Five of the 9 tested COVID+ patients died, all of COVID-related disease. Four of the 5 were 85 years of age or older, and all had multiple comorbid diseases known to affect survival in COVID-positive patients (Table 5). Two of the 5 died before operative intervention because of respiratory failure and were not intubated. Both patients had existing Do Not Resuscitate/Do Not Intubate orders. The 3 other deaths in the COVID+ group occurred between postoperative days 8 and 21. All 3 of these patients were intubated for COVID-related lung disease between postoperative days 4 and 6 and ultimately died (Table 5). The one presumed positive patient was 91 years old with dementia, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus, became acutely hypotensive on postoperative day 1, and went into asystole later that day. Of the 4 surviving COVID+ patients, 2 were discharged on postoperative days 6 and 8 and 2 remained admitted. A comparison of baseline comorbidities between COVID+ patients who were alive versus died is provided in Supplemental Digital Content 1 (see Table, http://links.lww.com/JOT/B93).\nSummary of Patients Who Died\nOne COVID-negative patient (not presumed positive), age 92 years, with comorbidities including coronary artery disease status post drug-eluting stent placement, atrial fibrillation with a pacemaker, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and chronic renal insufficiency had a cardiac arrest intraoperatively during hip hemiarthroplasty treatment for his/her unstable femoral neck fracture under general anesthesia and died in the postanesthesia care unit.\nInpatient mortality was significantly increased among COVID+ patients (56% vs. 4%; odds ratio 30.0, 95% confidence interval 4.3-206.9; P = 0.001). This difference in mortality was accentuated by including the one &quot;presumptive positive&quot; patient in the COVID+ group (60% vs. 2%, odds ratio 72.0, 95% confidence interval 7.9-754; P &lt; 0.001).\nCOVID-Related Complications\nPostoperative hypoxia occurred in 18 patients and was more common in the COVID+ group (83% vs. 26%; P = 0.011). Three of 9 (33%) COVID+ patients required intubation and admission to the ICU on postoperative day 4 (n = 1) and postoperative day 6 (n = 2), and all 3 died (see Table, Supplemental Digital Content 2, http://links.lww.com/JOT/B94). Of the 4 surviving COVID+ patients, 3 had postoperative hypoxia that resolved during their admission, none were intubated, and none required ICU admission. By contrast, no patients in the non-COVID cohort required intubation and 1 patient required admission to the ICU for acute-on-chronic heart failure on postoperative day 1. COVID+ patients were more likely to be treated for pneumonia (67% vs. 10%, P = 0.001). There were no differences noted between the 2 groups in terms of deep vein thrombosis, myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, urinary tract infection, decubitus ulcer formation, and transfusion. No patients were found to have neurovascular injury, hematoma, superficial or deep infection, wound dehiscence, pulmonary embolus, or cerebrovascular accident. No patients were treated with COVID-19-specific modalities, including remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, steroids, proning, or convalescent plasma.\nLaboratory Analysis\nLaboratory analysis (see Tables, Supplemental Digital Contents 3 and 4, http://links.lww.com/JOT/B95 and http://links.lww.com/JOT/B96) revealed changes in several values between specimens drawn on admission compared with those drawn on postoperative day 2. Preoperatively, COVID+ patients had lower absolute eosinophil (d = -0.66; P &lt; 0.01) and basophil counts (d = -0.55; P = 0.02) compared with the non-COVID patients. Postoperatively, the COVID+ patients had a lower absolute monocyte count than the non-COVID patients (d = -1.05; P = 0.01), despite being similar preoperatively (P = 0.35).\nDISCUSSION\nThis study raises several important concerns regarding hip fracture patients with concomitant COVID-19. First, despite having similar comorbidity profiles, COVID+ hip fracture patients were at a much greater risk of inpatient mortality than those without COVID-19. This difference was further emphasized after accounting for a &quot;presumptive positive&quot; patient whose death was attributed to sequelae of suspected COVID-19. It is important to note that although 5 of 9 COVID+ patients died, 4 of 9 only had mild postoperative hypoxia requiring supplemental oxygen through nasal cannula, which resolved during their admission. In addition, our study highlights characteristic presenting signs and symptoms of hip fracture patients with concomitant COVID-19, including hypoxia and bilateral interstitial infiltrates on chest radiography.\nOur finding of elevated inpatient mortality among COVID+ hip fracture patients is consistent with the results from China and Italy, which demonstrated early mortality rates among fracture patients of 40% and 44%, respectively. Importantly, the former study included 10 patients in total, 6 of whom had hip fractures (50% died) and 6 of whom had RT-PCR evidence of confirmed COVID-19 infection, with the rest diagnosed by findings on CT scan consistent with possible COVID infection. Furthermore, our results corroborate recent data from Europe comparing patients who tested positive for COVID-19 with those testing negative or not tested. These data demonstrated a 30.3% 14-day mortality rate among COVID+ hip fracture patients compared with 10.3% among those who tested negative and 2.7% among those not tested.\nScreening patients is important in ensuring that health care workers and patients are appropriately protected before, during, and after surgery. Published SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test metrics demonstrate a limited sensitivity of 32%-72%, suggesting a high false-negative risk. Furthermore, our study showed that patients who initially had negative RT-PCR tests for COVID infection later tested positive or developed severe symptoms in the acute postoperative period. Given these findings, care should be taken to protect the health care workforce and observe &quot;COVID precautions&quot; perioperatively for any patient with a high likelihood of infection regardless of preoperative test results, in line with previously described guidelines. It is also possible that patients may have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 after surgery. To the extent possible, reducing inpatient hospital stays for all patients with hip fractures is critical to reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19 and reducing mortality in this vulnerable population. In our attempts to decrease hospital stay, we drastically changed our discharge practices early in the COVID-19 pandemic to discharge patients earlier in their hospital course (eg, postoperative day 0 or 1); however, we recognize that the effort to minimize SARS-CoV-2 exposure may have been at the expense of discharging too early and missing typical perioperative complications.\nAlthough there are abundant data highlighting the importance of timely surgical intervention in patients with hip fractures, COVID-19 status should play a role in the decision making regarding timing of surgery. Recent studies suggest that mortality in COVID+ patients might be due to virally driven hyperinflammation, a &quot;cytokine storm,&quot; which corresponds to dramatic elevations in multiple inflammatory markers. A cytokine storm can lead to widespread organ failure, and the inflammation induced by an acute fracture or the surgery to repair the fracture could further exacerbate inflammation in acutely ill COVID+ patients. Thus, there may be a role for monitoring inflammatory markers and potentially delaying surgery until the inflammatory markers downtrend, although identifying a threshold level at which point it is &quot;safe&quot; to perform surgery may pose a secondary challenge. This approach would balance the need to stabilize the patient with the potential second-hit from surgery in the acute stage of COVID-19. Targeted immunotherapies or antiviral medications, which could directly reduce specific inflammatory factors induced by a fracture that can also exacerbate a cytokine storm, could be beneficial. Regional anesthesia and long-acting blocks may also play an important role in the temporization of hip fracture care during the acute inflammatory stage of COVID-19 before definitive fixation. Another important point related to surgical planning is how the informed consent discussion must be tailored to a patient with COVID-19. Acknowledging an elevated mortality rate during the informed consent process will likely influence the patient's and family's decisions regarding temporary or permanent comfort care and the possibility of delayed surgical intervention. Overall, further study will need to better elucidate the optimal surgical timing for COVID+ hip fracture patients and whether medical interventions can be administered before surgery to reduce mortality.\nWe acknowledge the limitations of this study. First, despite the multicenter nature of this study, the number of COVID+ patients was low. Therefore, the degree to which analyses can elucidate clinical factors associated with poor outcomes is limited. Second, the current study uses patients treated during the pandemic as a comparison group. This group represents an estimate of the baseline of care during the pandemic but does not represent the true baseline of care before the pandemic. Third, we limited our analysis to patients who tested positive for COVID-19. Other studies have highlighted the limited sensitivity of the SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR test and the need to evaluate potential missed cases in individuals with clinical and/or radiologic evidence of COVID-19. Given the high likelihood of asymptomatic COVID-19, it is possible that some patients in the sample had asymptomatic COVID-19 and were not tested or developed COVID-19 after a negative test and were not tested.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis multicenter retrospective cohort study demonstrated that hip fracture patients with concomitant COVID-19 infection had similar comorbidity profiles with significantly increased rates of inpatient mortality compared with those who tested negative or were not tested. Further studies are necessary to identify modifiable factors in patient care that can potentially lead to better outcomes in this high-risk population.\nThe authors report no conflict of interest.\nSupplemental digital content is available for this article.

Proximal Femoral Fragility Fractures in Patients with COVID-19 During the SARS-CoV-2 Outbreak in Northern Italy","abstract":"Background:\nFrom February 20 to April 2020, the coronavirus SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome)-CoV-2 spread in northern Italy, drastically challenging the care capacities of the national health care system.\n\n Unprepared for this emergency, hospitals have quickly reformulated paths of assistance in an effort to guarantee treatment for infected patients.\n\n Orthopaedic departments have been focused on elderly traumatology, especially the treatment of femoral neck fractures in patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19).\n\n The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the orthopaedic management strategy for femoral fragility fractures in COVID-19-positive patients with the hypothesis that operative treatment may contribute to the overall stability of the patient.\n\n\nMethods:\nSixteen patients affected by proximal femoral fracture and a recent history of fever, shortness of breath, and desaturation were admitted to the emergency room.\n\n Thoracic computed tomography (CT) and oropharyngeal swabs confirmed that they were positive for COVID-19, requiring hospitalization and prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin.\n\n\nResults:\nThree patients died before surgery because of severe respiratory insufficiency and multiple-organ-failure syndrome.\n\n Ten patients underwent surgery on the day after admission, whereas 3 patients had suspended their use of direct thrombin inhibitors and needed surgery to be delayed until the third day after admission.\n\n In all patients except 1, we noted an improvement in terms of O2 saturation and assisted respiration.\n\n In 9 patients, hemodynamic and respiratory stability was observed at an average of 7 days postoperatively.\n\n Four patients who underwent surgical treatment died of respiratory failure on the first day after surgery (1 patient), the third day after surgery (2 patients), or the seventh day after surgery (1 patient).\n\n\nConclusions:\nWe noted a stabilization of respiratory parameters in 12 COVID-19-positive patients who underwent surgery treatment of proximal femoral fractures.\n\n We believe that in elderly patients with COVID-19 who have proximal femoral fractures, surgery may contribute to the overall stability of the patient, seated mobilization, improvement in physiological ventilation, and general patient comfort in bed.\n\n\nLevel of Evidence:\nPrognostic Level IV.\n\n See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7224593","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery,

Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.\n\n\nFindings\n191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital.\n\n 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients).\n\n Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·03–1·17, per year increase; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·61–12·23; p&lt;0·0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL (18·42, 2·64–128·55; p=0·0033) on admission.\n\n Median duration of viral shedding was 20·0 days (IQR 17·0–24·0) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors.\n\n The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1

characterisation and epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and

perioperatively.\n We searched multiple electronic databases for relevant research papers, and carried out meta-analyses of weighted mean differences and interpreted in the light of statistical heterogeneity (I2).\n Fifteen RCTs recruiting 641 patients were included.\n Dexmedetomidine treatment significantly decreased interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-?) levels with mean differences [95% CI] in the changes from baseline between dexmedetomidine treated and controls of ?25.14 [?35.29, ?15.00]; P?&lt;?0.00001 (for IL-6), ?5.69 [?10.77, ?0.60]; P?&lt;?0.04 (for

A higher mortality rate has been described in older infected individuals. Patients with hip fracture are a particularly vulnerable population during this pandemic because older age is associated with a higher mortality rate. Our aim was to describe the early mortality rate and demographic variables in a hip fracture sample population in Spain during the coronavirus pandemic.\nMethods:\nThis is a multicenter, observational, retrospective, descriptive study. We collected data from 13 major hospitals in Spain from the beginning of the national state of alarm (declared on March 14, 2020, by the Spanish government) until the end of our study period on April 4, 2020. All patients who were &gt;=65 years of age, presented to the Emergency Department of the participating hospitals during this period with a diagnosis of proximal femoral fracture, and had a minimum follow-up of 10 days were included in the cohort. In addition to mortality, demographic and other potential prognostic variables were also collected.\nResults:\nIn this study, 136 patients with a hip fracture were included. Of these patients, 124 underwent a surgical procedure and 12 were managed nonoperatively. The total mortality rate was 9.6%. Sixty-two patients were tested for COVID-19, with 23 patients being positive. The mortality rate for these 23 patients was 30.4% (7 of 23 patients) at a mean follow-up of 14 days. The mortality rate was 10.3% (4 of 39) for patients who had been tested and had a negative result and 2.7% (2 of 74) for patients who had not been tested. Of the 12 patients who were managed nonoperatively, 8 (67%) died, whereas, of the 124 patients who were surgically treated, 5 (4%) died. Results differed among centers.\nConclusions:\nThere is a higher mortality rate in patients with a hip fracture and an associated positive test for COVID-19.\nLevel of Evidence:\nPrognostic Level IV. See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.\nThe outbreak of a new coronavirus, known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), began in December 2019 with the first case appearing in the city of Wuhan, Province of Hubei, People's Republic of China. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the disease a pandemic. By then, there were &gt;118,000 infected individuals in 113 countries and territories. At the time of this writing, the number of infected individuals had increased to &gt;1.2 million worldwide.\nCOVID-19 has quickly become a global threat to public health, jeopardizing the well-being of all people around the world, but especially those most vulnerable. Spain is one of the countries worst hit by the pandemic, with &gt;145,000 individuals infected and a mortality rate of 9.9% (&gt;14,500 deaths). In addition, the state of pandemic has social and economic consequences that threaten to collapse the health-care system. The control of COVID-19 propagation has become the main goal of several countries and there has been an unprecedented worldwide effort to collaborate and disseminate rapid scientific evidence to counteract its effects.\nThe surgical management of patients with this pathology represents a challenge for the surgeon and the staff in the operating room. Therefore, different guidelines and recommendations have been published for patients with COVID-19 who require surgical treatment. These guidelines vary because the information about the virus changes continuously and they are adapted to the demographic characteristics in each region.\nElderly patients with a proximal femoral fracture are a vulnerable group during this pandemic. Proximal femoral fractures have an incidence of 620 cases per 100,000 individuals per year and are common in those with comorbidities. They are associated with a 20% to 40% mortality rate during the first year and a 30-day mortality rate of 7% to 8%. Nonoperative management or a delayed surgical procedure is associated with higher mortality.\nIt is not known how mortality rates can be affected in this select group of patients during this pandemic, because the only evidence available is a report analyzing 10 patients with fracture and COVID-19. Elderly patients with a hip fracture are also at a higher risk of death in case of contagion by COVID-19 because of their age.\nThe overcrowding of health-care centers due to the alarming increase of patients with respiratory symptoms has prompted the staff of the hospitals to make certain changes to cope with this situation. Entire hospital areas dedicated to other specialties have been closed and have been adapted to patients with COVID-19, operating rooms for elective cases have been transformed into intensive care units, and all non-emergency surgical procedures have been cancelled in most Spanish hospitals.\nThe strain put on hospitals' surgical capacity to operate on patients with fracture, together with the unknown mortality rate associated with patients with a hip fracture and COVID-19 infection symptoms, has increased the necessity to understand the prognostic factors of this population to develop recommendations and guidelines. The objective of this observational study was to describe the early mortality rate in patients &gt;=65 years of age with an acute proximal femoral fracture during the global state of pandemic in Spanish hospitals and to describe the associated risk factors associated with mortality.\nMaterials and Methods\nStudy Design and Participants\nThis is a multicenter, observational, descriptive, retrospective, population-based study including a total of 13 hospitals within the Spanish territory. Eleven hospitals were level III (high-complexity trauma cases) and 2 hospitals were level II (medium-complexity trauma cases).\nIncluded participants were patients &gt;=65 years of age presenting to the Emergency Department of the participating hospitals with the clinical and radiographic diagnosis of a proximal femoral fracture (31-A and 31-B according to the OTA/AO classification) from a low-energy mechanism from March 14, 2020 (on the day that the Spanish government declared a state of national alarm due to COVID-19 and the pandemic surpassed 2,000 patients and 50 deaths from COVID-19 in Spain) until April 4, 2020, with a minimum of 10 days of follow-up. Exclusion criteria were patients with femoral shaft fractures, open fractures, pathological fractures, periprosthetic or peri-implant fractures, or polytrauma.\nThe study strictly followed the ethical principles of biomedical research. The approval of the Ethics Committee of Fundacio Unio Catalana d'Hospitals (Catalan Hospitals Union Foundation) was obtained and documented (CEI 20/31), and the Ethics Committee's approval of all of the participating hospitals was procured. The requirement for informed consent was waived by the Ethics Committee.\nData Collection\nDemographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment, and outcome data were extracted from electronic medical records by the site investigators of each hospital with use of a customized data collection form. Data were submitted to the methods center where missing, inconsistent, or implausible data were queried. The reported laboratory parameters were those obtained when the patients presented to the Emergency Department of the treating hospital. The reported clinical status and physical examination measurements were those observed on initial presentation. Because of confinement, the follow-up after discharge was done by telephone rather than in person when necessary.\nVariables\nThe primary outcome of this study was early mortality. Demographic variables were sex, age, residence (nursing home or family home), and living in a risk area (defined as a hospital catchment area with &gt;100 COVID-19 cases per 100,000 inhabitants). The reported clinical variables included the type of fracture, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification, alterations in chest radiographs, and cough on presentation. The laboratory variables included white blood cell count and creatinine levels on presentation. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was determined by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test from throat swab samples. The variables related to treatment included the type of surgical procedure performed (fracture fixation or hip replacement) or nonoperative treatment and surgical procedure delay in days since presentation to the Emergency Department.\nWe collected hospital data including trauma center level according to the Spanish National Health System and a COVID-19 high-occupancy score evaluating the number of patients with COVID-19 in each hospital to define the strain on hospital resources. The degree to which a hospital has been strained during this pandemic is difficult to quantify, especially because the infection rate has been unevenly distributed across time and territory. The pandemic state has been a dynamic process, and, thus, it has been difficult to compare hospitals at 1 specific time point. The virus has put pressure not only on hospitals' infrastructures, but also on their staff, both physically and psychologically. To compare this strain across participating hospitals, we designed a score based on 3 indicators: (1) occupancy including &gt;50% patients with COVID-19 at any point during the observation period, (2) decrease in the hospital's capability to operate on fracture cases during the observation period (e.g., lack of operating rooms, equipment, or personnel), and (3) institutional changes in the hospital's infrastructure to accommodate COVID-19 cases (e.g., closing operating rooms or closing outpatient clinics).\nAny affirmative answer added 1 point, for a minimum of 0 points (low COVID-19 occupancy) to a maximum of 3 points (high COVID-19 occupancy).\nStatistical Analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed following the principles specified in the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) Topic E9 (CPMP/ICH/363/96).\nContinuous variables were presented as the mean and the standard deviation, and categorical variables were presented as the number and percentage. We used the Mann-Whitney U test, chi-square test, or Fisher exact test to compare differences between survivors and non-survivors where appropriate. Only variables with &lt;20% missing data were reported in this study.\nA 2-sided alpha of &lt;0.05 was considered significant. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics, version 25 (IBM).\nResults\nA total of 136 patients were included: 123 patients (90.4%) had survived and 13 patients (9.6%) had died during our study period. Table I shows a summary of the main demographic variables collected. Variables are described for the total number of included patients and separately for the number of patients who survived and those who had died. The mean age of the patients included was 85 years of age, with a minimum age of 65 years and a maximum age of 101 years. There were 106 patients who lived in their family home and 30 patients who came from a nursing home. Seventy-one patients came from a catchment area with a known incidence of COVID-19 of &gt;100 per 100,000 people (considered a high-risk area).\nDemographic Variables\nVariable	Total (N = 136)	Survivor (N = 123)	Non-Survivor (N = 13)	P Value*	 	Sex 				0.310	 	 Female	102 (75%)	94 (76.4%)	8 (61.5%)		 	 Male	34 (25%)	29 (23.6%)	5 (38.5%)		 	Age (yr)	85.3 +- 7.6	85.2 +- 7.7	87.0 +- 7.2	0.407	 	Residence 				0.009	 	 Nursing home	30 (22.1%)	23 (18.7%)	7 (53.8%)		 	 Family home	106 (77.9%)	100 (81.3%)	6 (46.2%)		 	Living in area of risk  				0.081	 	 Yes	71 (52.2%)	61 (49.6%)	10 (76.9%)		 	 No	65 (47.8%)	62 (50.4%)	3 (23.1%)		 	Type of fracture 				0.396	 	 Femoral neck fracture	52 (38.2%)	48 (39%)	4 (30.8%)		 	 Trochanteric fracture	84 (61.8%)	75 (61%)	9 (69.2%)		 	ASA classification#	117	106	11	0.011	 	 I 	2 (1.7%)	2 (1.9%)	0 (0%)		 	 II 	13 (11.1%)	13 (12.3%)	0 (0%)		 	 III 	88 (75.2%)	81 (76.4%)	7 (63.6%)		 	 IV 	12 (10.3%)	10 (9.4%)	2 (18.2%)		 	 V 	2 (1.7%)	0 (0%)	2 (18.2%)		 	Surgery delay (days)	2.4 +- 2.2	2.4 +- 2.2	2.2 +- 2.3	0.844	 	Treatment 				&lt;0.001	 	 Surgical	124 (91.2%)	119 (96.7%)	5 (38.5%)		 	 Nonoperative	12 (8.8%)	4 (3.3%)	8 (61.5%)		 	Follow-up **(days)	14.3 +- 3.9	15.0 +- 3.02	7.5 +- 5.0	&lt;0.001	 	\nThe p values were calculated by the Mann-Whitney U test, chi-square test, or Fisher exact test, as appropriate.\nThe values are given as the number of patients, with the percentage in parentheses.\nThe values are given as the mean and the standard deviation.\nA risk area was defined as a hospital catchment area with &gt;100 COVID-19 cases per 100,000 inhabitants.\nSome data were missing for this category, so the values are given as the number of patients with available data.\nThe follow-up was from the day of presentation until death or the end of the study period.\nEighty-four fractures were intertrochanteric, and 52 fractures were femoral neck fractures. There were 124 patients who underwent a surgical procedure and 12 patients who did not, either because they died before they underwent an operation or because they were deemed too unstable to undergo surgical treatment. The group of patients who were treated surgically had lower ASA scores. Only 8.1% of the patients who underwent a surgical procedure had ASA scores &gt;=4, whereas 50.0% of the patients managed nonoperatively had ASA scores of &gt;=4, showing a positive association between ASA score and the type of treatment selected (Fisher exact test, p = 0.002). The mean delay from presentation to the surgical procedure was 2.4 days, with a minimum delay of 0 days and a maximum delay of 13 days.\nParticipating hospitals were mainly level III. A high COVID-19 occupancy score was reported in 11 centers. Table II shows the main characteristics of the participating hospitals including the number of hip fractures treated, the number of patients with hip fracture who tested positive for COVID-19, the number of deaths per hospital, and mortality rates. The number of patients included by each hospital ranged between 4 and 22 patients.\nDescription of Hospitals\nHospital No.	Hospital Trauma Center Level*	COVID-19 Occupancy Score 	No. of Patients with Hip Fractures Treated 	No. of COVID-19-Positive Cases	No. of Deaths	Hip Fracture Mortality Rate per Hospital	 	1	II	3	19 (14.0%)	1	3	15.8%	 	2	II	2	9 (6.6%)	1	3	33.3%	 	3	III	3	7 (5.1%)	1	0	0%	 	4	III	3	7 (5.1%)	0	0	0%	 	5	III	3	7 (5.1%)	0	1	14.3%	 	6	III	3	4 (2.9%)	0	0	0%	 	7	III	3	5 (3.7%)	1	0	0%	 	8	III	3	13 (9.6%)	5	1	7.7%	 	9	III	3	8 (5.9%)	2	1	12.5%	 	10	III	3	18 (13.2%)	10	4	22.2%	 	11	III	1	22 (16.2%)	0	0	0%	 	12	III	3	7 (5.1%)	2	0	0%	 	13	III	3	10 (7.4%)	0	0	0%	 	Total			136	23	13	9.6%	 	\nThis is the level of complexity according to the Spanish National Health System: III indicated high complexity, II indicated medium complexity, and I indicated low complexity.\nThis is the measure of strain placed on a hospital's infrastructure because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe values are given as the number of patients, with the percentage in parentheses.\nTable III shows clinical parameters on the presentation date to the Emergency Department except for the COVID-19 PCR test, which was not necessarily done on arrival.

The observed mortality rate at a mean follow-up of 14 days was higher than the 30-day mortality rate reported by the Spanish Registro Nacional de Fracturas de Cadera (National Hip Fracture Registry) and other national registries in Europe. Our cohort data were similar to the data reported by the Spanish National Hip Fracture Registry in terms of sex ratio, mean age, place of residence, type of fracture, ASA classification, surgical procedure delay, and surgical treatment.\nDuring this study period, there was no consensus among hospitals on whom to test for COVID-19. Because of the sudden impact of the pandemic in Spain, there was an initial lack of tests for COVID-19 and protocols for testing patients differed among hospitals. In general, patients who presented in the Emergency Department with any respiratory symptoms (cough, fever, shortness of breath) were tested. However, patients who presented for any other cause and did not show symptoms on presentation were not systematically tested. From our data, for this 14-day follow-up period, the mortality rate was 30.4% for patients who tested positive for COVID-19 and 10.3% for patients who tested negative for COVID-19. Patients who were not tested had a mortality rate of 2.7%, similar to the mortality rates described during the same season in the previous year.\nWe observed that the hospitals with more COVID-19-positive cases also had higher mortality rates. The mortality rate for patients living in their family homes was significantly lower at 5.7% than that for patients living in nursing homes at 23.3%; nursing homes have been breeding grounds for the virus.\nWith regard to the clinical variables collected in the Emergency Department, both the presence of cough and a chest radiograph with lobar consolidation were associated with a higher mortality rate. The white blood cell count was similar in patients who survived and in those who died.\nTwelve patients were managed nonoperatively; of these, 8 (67%) died. This rate is higher than previously reported mortality rates for patients treated nonoperatively. The main reason for not treating patients surgically was that they were deemed unfit for a surgical procedure, as their higher ASA score suggests.\nIn contrast, of the 124 patients treated surgically, 5 (4.0%) died. Two patients tested positive for COVID-19, and 1 patient did not show signs of pneumonia before the surgical procedure and was diagnosed with COVID-19 at 4 days after the operation.\nOur study had some limitations. First, because of the retrospective design, the measurement of laboratory parameters that have shown to be important prognostic factors in patients with COVID-19 (e.g., lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], ferritin levels, and D-dimer) was uneven because hospitals implemented different protocols during this period. Only variables with a completeness of &gt;80% were included in this study. Second, the short follow-up period may have led to an underestimation of the mortality rate for these patients. Finally, the interpretation of our findings may have been limited by the sample size.\nFurther research should be directed toward studying prognostic factors to understand the effect of a surgical procedure and its timing in the pro-inflammatory cascade (of importance in the clinical evolution of COVID-19 pneumonia) on the mortality rate.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study describing mortality rates in patients with a proximal femoral fracture. According to these results, it seems that patients with COVID-19 infection, despite their higher mortality rates, could benefit from an early surgical procedure and, therefore, they should continue to undergo surgical treatment if they are clinically fit.\nWhenever possible, treatment should be expedited as previously described in the orthopaedic literature. Policies should be directed into restructuring hospitals to accommodate this vulnerable population even in the case of high COVID-19 hospital occupancy.\nA list of the Spanish HIP-COVID Investigation Group members is included as a note at the end of the article.\nDisclosure: The authors indicated that no external funding was received for any aspect of this work.

Amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk samples from six patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and all samples tested negative for the virus.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe clinical characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women were similar to those reported for non-pregnant adult patients who developed COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n Findings from this small group of cases suggest that there is currently no evidence for intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission in women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy.\n\n\nFunding\nHubei Science and Technology Plan, Wuhan University Medical Development Plan.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7159281","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Huijun","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Juanjuan","surname":"Guo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chen","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fan","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xuechen","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiafu","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Dongchi","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dan","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qing","surname":"Gong","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Liao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Huixia","surname":"Yang","email":"yanghuixia@bjmu.edu.cn","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Hou","email":"houwei@whu.edu.cn","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yuanzhen","surname":"Zhang","email":"zhangyuanzhen@whu.edu.cn","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.3389/fped.2020.565522","date":"2020-08-20","title":"Safe Perinatal Management of Neonates Born to SARS-CoV-2 Positive Mothers at the Epicenter of the Italian Epidemic","abstract":"Introduction: 2019-novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic has recently struck Northern Italy.\n Limited data are available about COVID-19 during pregnancy and infancy, mostly from China.\n Herein, our experience on a safe perinatal management of neonates born to COVID-19 mothers is reported.\n","id":"PMC7658585","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Frontiers Media S.A.","authors":[{"firstname":"Giacomo","surname":"Biasucci","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Giuseppe","surname":"Cannalire","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Akamin","surname":"Raymond","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Maria Elena","surname":"Capra","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Belinda","surname":"Benenati","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Giovanni","surname":"Vadacca","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Roberta","surname":"Schiavo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Cristiana","surname":"Pavesi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Renza","surname":"Bonini","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1111/nyas.14477","date":"2020-08-03","title":"Transmission of SARS?CoV?2 through breast milk and\nbreastfeeding: a living systematic review","abstract":"The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID?19) is caused by\ninfection with a novel coronavirus strain, the severe acute respiratory syndrome\ncoronavirus 2 (SARS?CoV?2).\n At present, there is limited information on potential\ntransmission of the infection from mother to child, particularly through breast milk\nand breastfeeding.\n Here, we provide a living systematic review to capture information\nthat might necessitate changes in the guidance on breast milk and breastfeeding given\nthe uncertainty in this area.\n Our search retrieved 19,414 total records; 605 were\nconsidered for full?text eligibility and no ongoing trials were identified.\n Our\nreview includes 340 records, 37 with breast milk samples and 303 without.\n The 37\narticles with analyzed breast milk samples reported on 77 mothers who were\nbreastfeeding their children; among them, 19 of 77 children were confirmed COVID?19\ncases based on RT?PCR assays, including 14 neonates and five older infants.\n Nine of\nthe 68 analyzed breast milk samples from mothers with COVID?19 were positive for\nSARS?CoV?2 RNA; of the exposed infants, four were positive and two were negative for\nCOVID?19.

provide a comprehensive overview on this broad topic in a rapid format behooving an emergent pandemic we conducted a scoping review.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>A scoping review was conducted to compile evidence on direct and indirect impacts of the pandemic on maternal health and provide an overview of the most significant outcomes thus far.\n\n Working papers and news articles were considered appropriate evidence along with peer-reviewed publications in order to capture rapidly evolving updates.\n\n Literature in English published from January 1st to September 11 2020 was included if it pertained to the direct or indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the physical, mental, economic, or social health and wellbeing of pregnant people.\n\n Narrative descriptions were written about subject areas for which the authors found the most evidence.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>The search yielded 396 publications, of which 95 were included.\n\n Pregnant individuals were found to be at a heightened risk of more severe symptoms than people who are not pregnant.\n\n Intrauterine, vertical, and breastmilk transmission were unlikely.\n\n Labor, delivery, and breastfeeding guidelines for COVID-19 positive patients varied.\n\n Severe increases in maternal mental health issues, such as clinically relevant anxiety and depression, were reported.\n\n Domestic violence appeared to

infection than people who are not pregnant, however pregnant people with symptomatic COVID-19 may experience more adverse outcomes compared to non-pregnant people and seem to face disproportionate adverse socio-economic consequences.\n\n High income and low- and middle-income countries alike faced significant struggles.\n\n Further resources should be directed towards quality epidemiological studies.\n\n\nPlain English summary\nid='Par5'>The Covid-19 pandemic impacts reproductive and perinatal health both directly through infection itself but also indirectly as a consequence of changes in health care, social policy, or social and economic circumstances.\n\n The direct and indirect consequences of COVID-19 on maternal health are intertwined.\n\n To provide a comprehensive overview on this broad topic we conducted a scoping review.\n\n Pregnant women who have symptomatic COVID-19 may experience more severe outcomes than people who are not pregnant.\n\n Intrauterine and breastmilk transmission, and the passage of the virus from mother to baby during delivery are unlikely.\n\n The guidelines for labor, delivery, and breastfeeding for COVID-19 positive patients vary, and this variability could create uncertainty and unnecessary harm.\n\n Prenatal care visits decreased, healthcare infrastructure was strained, and potentially harmful policies are implemented with little evidence in high and low/middle income countries.\n\n The social and economic impact of COVID-19 on maternal health is marked.\n\n A high frequency of maternal mental health problems, such as clinically relevant anxiety and depression, during the epidemic are reported in many countries.\n\n This likely reflects an increase in problems, but studies demonstrating a true change are lacking.\n\n Domestic violence appeared to spike.\n\n Women were more vulnerable to losing their income due to the pandemic than men, and working mothers struggled with increased childcare demands.\n\n We make several recommendations: more resources should be directed to epidemiological studies, health and social services for pregnant women and mothers should not be diminished, and more focus on maternal mental health during the epidemic is needed.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7812564","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

A multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to assess the effect of early surgery on the likelihood of 1-year mortality after hip fracture, adjusting for risk factors that could affect the outcome under study.\n\n The absolute number of deaths prevented by exposure to early surgery was calculated.\n\n\nResults\nWe studied a total of 405,037 admissions for hip fracture.\n\n Patients who underwent surgery within 2 days had lower 1-year mortality compared to those who waited for surgery more than 2 days (Hazard Ratios -HR-: 0.83; 95 % CI: 0.82–0.85).\n\n The number of deaths prevented

data from the Swedish Fracture Register","abstract":"Background\nHumeral fractures are common, but the association between the patho-anatomical fracture pattern and patient characteristics has been inadequately studied and epidemiological knowledge is scarce.\n\n Following the introduction of the Swedish Fracture Register (SFR), risk factors for various fractures can be studied, as well as the outcome of different treatments.\n\n The objective of this study was to analyse adult humeral fractures in Gothenburg from a descriptive epidemiological perspective.\n\n\nMethods\nAll humeral fractures registered in the SFR at Sahlgrenska University Hospital in 2011–2013 in patients aged???16 years were included.\n\n The fractures were divided into humeral segments (proximal, shaft and distal humerus) and analysed according to patient characteristics and patho-anatomical pattern.\n\n Furthermore, overall and age-specific incidence rates were calculated.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 2,011 humeral fractures were registered in the SFR, of which 79 % were proximal, 13 % shaft and 8 % distal humeral fractures.\n\n The mean age was 66.8 years and women ran a higher risk of humeral fractures than men (female/male ratio 2.4:1).\n\n On average, women were older than men at the time of fracture (mean age 70.1 years for women vs.\n\n 58.9 years for men).\n\n The overall incidence of humeral fractures was 104.7 per 100,000 inhabitants per year, with a segment-specific incidence of 83.0 for proximal fractures, 13.4 for shaft fractures and 8.3 per 100,000 person-years for distal fractures.\n\n There was a distinct increase in the age-specific incidence from the fifth decade and onwards, regardless of fracture site.\n\n Most fractures occurred in older patients (83 %?&gt;?50 years) as a result of a simple or an unspecified fall (79 %?&gt;?50 years).\n\n Only 1.2 % of all fractures were open injuries and 1.3 % were pathological.\n\n\nConclusion\nThis population-based study provides updated epidemiological data on humeral fractures in a Western-European setting.\n\n Most humeral fractures occur as the result of low-energy falls in the elderly population, indicating the influence of age-related risk factors in these fractures.\n\n The SFR will be a useful tool for providing continuous information on fracture epidemiology, risk factors and treatment outcome and these population-based data are essential in the planning of future fracture prevention and management.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4830043","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

geriatric patients.\n\n Consequently, there have been several large observational studies, which continue to provide new insights into differences in outcomes among hip fracture patients.\n\n However, few hip fracture studies have specifically examined the relationship between hip fracture patterns, sex, and short-term outcomes including hospital length of stay and discharge disposition in

fractures (820.00-820.9).\n\n Patient variables were patient demographics, mechanism of injury, injury severity score, hospital and ICU length of stay, co-morbidities, injury location, discharge disposition, and in-patient mortality.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 325 patient records met the inclusion criteria.\n\n The mean age of the patients was 82.2 years, and the majority of the patients were

changes, the incidence of these injuries is rapidly increasing.\n\n Treatment of these fractures is associated with high rates of complications.\n\n In addition, the long-term results remain poor, with high morbidity, declines in function, and high mortality.\n\n Therefore, in this study, complication rates and patients’ outcomes were evaluated after fixation of geriatric trochanteric fractures using the Gamma3™ nail.\n\n\nMethods\nPatients aged 60 years old or older, with pertrochanteric and subtrochanteric femoral fractures, were included.\n\n Patients with polytrauma or pathological fractures were excluded.\n\n Age, sex, and fracture type were collected on admission.\n\n In addition, data were recorded concerning the surgeon (resident vs.\n\n consultant), time of operation, and local or systemic perioperative complications.\n\n Complications were also collected at the 6- and 12-month follow-ups after trauma.\n\n Barthel Index, IADL, and EQ-5D measurements were evaluated retrospectively on admission, as well as at discharge and during the follow-up.\n\n\nResults\nNinety patients were prospectively included between April 2009 and September 2010. The patients’ average age was 81 years old, and their average ASA score was 3.

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

None of the patients were put on mechanical ventilation. One patient had a presumed venous thromboembolism postoperatively and subsequently died on postoperative day 19, likely due to respiratory failure. There were no other deaths in the early postoperative period. The average length of inpatient stay was 7.8 days.\nConclusions\nOur findings suggest that hip fracture patients who present with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 infection may have temporarily increased oxygen demands postoperatively, but they can safely undergo early surgical intervention after appropriate medical optimization.\nIntroduction\nThe first confirmed case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or COVID-19 infection in the United States was reported on January 31, 2020 in Washington state. Soon thereafter, the COVID-19 pandemic spread across the country and placed the United States healthcare system under substantial strain. Following the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in New York state on March 1, 2020, New York City quickly became the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States.\nAs the COVID-19 outbreak continues, there have been anecdotal and epidemiological evidence of patients avoiding hospitals and clinics despite requiring medical care, with significant decreases in hospital admissions for non-COVID-19 diagnoses. Potential delays in presentation for hip fractures are concerning given the morbidity and mortality associated with prolonged immobilization and delayed care. An additional concern is the potential independent effects of COVID-19 infection on early outcomes in the subgroup of hip fracture patients who are infected. The 1-year mortality rate in hip fracture patients has traditionally been estimated to be approximately 30%, while the 30-day mortality rate has been reported to be 5%-7%. Early reports from Wuhan, China and Italy, however, have showed significantly higher early mortality rates in patients with a hip fracture and COVID-19 infection.\nAs of May 26, 2020, there have been no studies specifically examining outcomes in patients with hip fractures and COVID-19 infection who undergo surgical intervention in the United States. The purpose of this study was to report the clinical characteristics and early outcomes in a series of COVID-19-positive hip fracture patients who underwent surgery during the COVID-19 outbreak in New York City.\nMethods\nThis research was approved by our internal Institutional Review Board. A retrospective cohort study was performed of patients &gt;=60 years of age who had positive COVID-19 diagnostic testing and underwent primary hip fracture surgery at our institution in New York City during the COVID-19 outbreak from March 1, 2020 to May 22, 2020. All patients at our institution who were hospitalized during the COVID-19 outbreak underwent COVID-19 diagnostic testing with a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for the qualitative detection of nucleic acid from SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swabs. COVID-positive hip fracture patients who were treated non-operatively were excluded, as our specific aim in this study was to examine outcomes after operative treatment of hip fractures. Other exclusion criteria included bilateral hip fractures, periprosthetic hip fractures, and revision hip surgery.\nPatient demographics were collected, including age, gender, and medical comorbidities. Evidence of COVID-19 infection was recorded, including clinical signs and symptoms, as well as laboratory testing and chest radiograph findings. The administration of any COVID-19-specific medical treatments were noted. The mechanism of injury, fracture type, and surgery performed were reviewed for all patients. Fractures were classified according to the AO/OTA classification. All patients were allowed to weight bear as tolerated postoperatively. Perioperative variables included laboratory testing on admission, time to surgery, and type of anesthesia. Laboratory testing included white blood cell (WBC) count, hemoglobin (Hgb), hematocrit (Hct), platelets, sodium, potassium, creatinine, prothrombin time (PT), international normalized ratio (INR), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and inflammatory markers. Inflammatory markers included procalcitonin, C reactive protein, D-dimer, ferritin, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).\nOutcomes of interest were oxygen demand on postoperative days 1 through 3, inpatient complications, length of stay (LOS), readmission, and death. Inpatient complications included blood transfusion, venous thromboembolism (VTE), cardiac complication, respiratory complication, acute kidney injury (AKI), and surgical site complication. Respiratory complications included hypoxia requiring prolonged administration of supplemental oxygen therapy beyond the third postoperative day, respiratory failure, and mechanical ventilation. AKI was defined as an increase in creatinine of 0.3 mg/dL or more in 48 h.\nResults\nClinical characteristics and outcomes in 10 patients with COVID-19 who underwent hip fracture surgery.\nTable 1	 	\n	Case 1	Case 2	Case 3	Case 4	Case 5	Case 6	Case 7	Case 8	Case 9	Case 10	 	Clinical characteristics	 	Age (years), sex	83 F	82 F	90 F	88 F	73 M	81 F	80 F	78 F	75 F	67 M	 	Comorbidities	Asthma, COPD, OSA, HTN, HLD, breast cancer, CVA, hypothyroidism, Sjogren's disease	HTN, HLD, IBS	HTN, CHF, DM	HTN, DM, pancreatic cancer, renal cancer, dementia	HLD, BPH, OCD	HTN, atrial fibrillation, hypothyroidism, hepatitis C, dementia	Cognitive disorder	HTN, TIA, hypothyroidism	HTN, CAD, DM	Asthma, kidney stones, BPH	 	Time to surgery (days)	1	1	1	1	1	2	2	1	1	1	 	Fracture type	31A2.2	31B1.3	31A1.2	31A1.3	31A2.1	31A2.3	31A2.1	31B1.3	31A1.3	31B1.2	 	Surgery performed	CMN	Hemi	CMN	CMN	CMN	CMN	CMN	THA	CMN	FNS	 	Type of anesthesia	General	Neuraxial	Neuraxial	General	Neuraxial	Neuraxial	General	Neuraxial	Neuraxial	General	 	Respiratory symptoms on admission	 	Fever	No	No	No	No	No	No	No	No	No	No	 	Chills	No	No	No	No	No	No	No	No	No	No	 	Cough	No	No	No	No	No	No	No	No	No	No	 	Sore throat	No	No	No	No	No	No	No	No	No	No	 	Dyspnea	No	No	No	No	No	No	No	No	No	No	 	Chest pain	No	No	No	No	No	No	No	No	No	No	 	Fatigue	No	No	No	No	No	No	No	No	No	No	 	SpO2	100% on RA	94% on RA	97% on RA	89% on RA	95% on RA	97% on RA	95% on RA	98% on RA	98% on RA	98% on RA	 	Laboratory test values on admission	 	WBC (4.5-11.0 K/muL)	7.7	9.5	8.7	12.0	8.4	8.5	19.5	17.7	17.0	13.1	 	Hgb/Hct (13.9-16.3 g/dL)/(42-52%)	11.5/35	14.4/43	13.0/39	10.5/30	7.7/23	15.3/46	12.3/35	12.7/39	10.5/32	12.9/38.5	 	Platelets (150-450 K/muL)	170	302	201	204	236	225	223	230	624	164	 	Creatinine (0.7-1.3 mg/dL)	0.50	0.87	0.98	0.64	1.51	0.58	0.70	0.56	1.54	1.03	 	Sodium (135-145 mmol/L)	138	139	129	136	135	136	136	130	128	139	 	Potassium (3.5-5.2 mmol/L)	3.3	5.7	4.7	3.6	4.8	4.4	4.0	4.1	4.5	3.9	 	PT/INR (12.0-14.2 s)/(0.9-1.1)	13.6/1.1	12.7/1.0	13.7/1.1	15.0/1.2	14.1/1.1	15.4/1.3	13.8/1.1	13.9/1.1	14.2/1.1	13.8/1.1	 	PTT (24.6-34.7 s)	23.2	24.5	27.3	29.8	29.2	25.6	30.0	32.4	26.5	28.8	 	Inflammatory markers	 	Procalcitonin (&lt;0.15 ng/mL)	0.09	0.09	-	0.04	0.14	0.07	0.09	-	0.48	-	 	C reactive protein (&lt;5.1 mg/L)	194.1	32.1	-	30.7	144.8	16.2	111.3	-	-	-	 	D-dimer (&lt;0.5 mug/mL)	5.85	2.88	-	8.99	6.08	4.91	8.64	-	-	-	 	Ferritin (15-150 ng/mL)	223	1220	-	13	801	1893	350	-	-	-	 	LDH (100-220 U/L)	284	228	-	357	357	311	453	-	-	-	 	Chest radiograph on admission	Unremarkable	Unremarkable	Unremarkable	Unremarkable	Multifocal/atypical pneumonia	Unremarkable	Unremarkable	Unremarkable	Unremarkable	Unremarkable	 	COVID-19 medical treatment	Yes (AZM, HCQ)	No	No	Yes (HCQ)	Yes (AZM, HCQ)	No	Yes (AZM, HCQ)	No	No	No	 	Postoperative outcomes	 	SpO2 on POD1	99% on RA	98% on 2L NC	99% on RA	96% on 4L NC	96% on 8L Venturi mask	97% on RA	98% on 4L NC	98% on 2L NC	95% on RA	97% on RA	 	SpO2 on POD2	98% on RA	95% on RA	97% on RA	94% on 2L NC	97% on 4L NC	94% on RA	94% on 2L NC	95% on RA	98% on RA	98% on RA	 	SpO2 on POD3	93% on RA	99% on RA	96% on RA	98% on RA	96% on 6L NC	---(discharged on POD2)	90% on 2L NC	96% on RA	96% on RA	97% on RA	 	Blood transfusion	Yes	No	No	Yes	Yes	No	No	Yes	No	No	 	VTE	Yes	No	No	No	No	No	No	No	No	No	 	Cardiac complication	No	No	No	No	No	No	No	No	No	No	 	Respiratory complication	Yes (respiratory failure)	No	No	No	Yes (prolonged hypoxia requiring supplemental O2)	No	Yes (prolonged hypoxia requiring supplemental O2)	No	No	No	 	AKI	No	No	Yes	No	No	No	No	No	No	No	 	Surgical site complication	No	No	No	No	No	No	No	No	No	No	 	Mortality	Yes (POD 19)	No	No	No	No	No	No	No	No	No	 	LOS (days)	-	4	7	20	7	4	9	6	5	a	 	Disposition	-	Acute rehab	SAR	SAR	SAR	SAR	SAR	Home	SAR	a	 	Readmission	-	Yes	Yes	No	No	No	No	No	No	-	 	Reason for readmission	-	Symptomatic COVID-19	Unknown (OSH records unavailable)	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	 	Time of readmission	-	POD 9	POD 8	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	 	\nCOPD: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; OSA: obstructive sleep apnea; HTN: hypertension; HLD: hyperlipidemia; CVA: cerebrovascular accident; IBS: irritable bowel syndrome; CHF: congestive heart failure; DM: diabetes mellitus; BPH: benign prostatic hyperplasia; OCD: obsessive compulsive disorder; TIA: transient ischemic attack; CAD: coronary artery disease; CMN: cephalomedullary nail; Hemi: hip hemiarthroplasty; THA: total hip arthroplasty; FNS: Femoral Neck System; RA: room air; AZM: azithromycin; HCQ: hydroxychloroquine; NC: nasal cannula; POD: postoperative day; SAR: subacute rehab; OSH: outside hospital.\nRemains hospitalized - medically cleared for discharge but awaiting insurance authorization for admission to a rehabilitation facility.\nTen patients met our selection criteria and were included in this study. The clinical characteristics and postoperative complications are outlined in Table 1. There were 8 females and 2 males, ranging from 67 to 90 years of age. All 10 patients sustained hip fractures after a low-velocity fall from standing height. Seven of the patients had a positive COVID-19 test upon presentation to the hospital, whereas the remaining 3 patients (Cases 1, 2, and 9) had a nosocomial infection with a positive COVID-19 test within 5, 8, and 9 days of admission, respectively. None of the patients presented with symptoms of fever, chills, cough, sore throat, dyspnea, chest pain, or fatigue. Only 1 patient (Case 4) presented with obvious signs of COVID-19 infection on presentation, with hypoxia and an oxygen saturation of 89% on room air. Another patient (Case 2) presented with mild hypoxia and an oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. The remaining 8 patients did not exhibit any signs or symptoms of COVID-19 infection on admission.\nLaboratory test values on admission were notable for leukocytosis in 5 patients, significant anemia with Hgb&lt;8 g/dL in 1 patient, and elevated platelet count in 1 patient. Two patients presented with elevated creatinine. Hyponatremia and hyperkalemia were noted in 3 patients and 1 patient, respectively. PT and INR were mildly elevated in 2 patients and none of the patients had an abnormal PTT value. Of the 7 patients who received testing for 1 or more of the inflammatory markers of interest, all had at least 1 elevated inflammatory marker. Only 1 patient (Case 5) had an abnormal chest radiograph on admission that demonstrated evidence of multifocal or atypical pneumonia. Four patients (Cases 1, 4, 5, and 7) received COVID-19-specific medical therapy with hydroxychloroquine and/or azithromycin.\nAll patients underwent surgery within 2 days of admission. There were 7 patients who underwent cephalomedullary nailing for 31A-type fractures, 2 patients who underwent hemiarthroplasty or total hip arthroplasty (THA) for 31B1.3 fractures, and 1 patient who underwent internal fixation with the Femoral Neck System (DePuy Synthes, Warsaw, Indiana) for a 31B1.2 fracture. Four patients received general anesthesia and 6 patients received neuraxial anesthesia with a single-shot spinal anesthetic. There were no intraoperative complications.\nPostoperatively, 5 out of the 10 patients required supplemental oxygen. Two of these patients (Cases 2 and 8) were successfully weaned off 2 L per minute (L/min) nasal cannula after postoperative day 1. Another patient (Case 4) was weaned off nasal cannula after postoperative day 2. The other 2 patients (Cases 5, and 7) had persistently elevated oxygen demands requiring prolonged administration of supplemental oxygen beyond postoperative day 3. None of the patients were put on mechanical ventilation.\nFour out of the 10 patients received a perioperative blood transfusion. One patient (Case 1) was treated for a presumed VTE during hospitalization, and 1 patient (Case 3) had a postoperative AKI. There were no in-hospital cardiac complications or surgical site complications. One patient (Case 1) died during hospitalization on postoperative day 19 after being found unresponsive, likely due to respiratory failure. One patient (Case 10) remained hospitalized at the time of reporting; he was medically cleared for discharge to a rehabilitation facility, but awaiting insurance authorization. Four of the remaining 8 patients had a LOS &gt;=7 days, with the average LOS among these patients being 7.8 days. Seven patients were discharged to rehabilitation facilities and 1 patient was discharged home with services. Lastly, there were 2 early readmissions. One patient (Case 2) was readmitted at our institution for symptomatic COVID-19 infection. The other patient (Case 3) was readmitted at an outside hospital and we were unable to access the outside records to assess the reason for readmission.\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we presented the clinical characteristics and early outcomes from a cohort of 10 COVID-positive patients who underwent hip fracture surgery at our institution during the COVID-19 outbreak in New York City. All of the patients underwent surgery within 2 days of admission. Eight out of the 10 patients in our series were asymptomatic on admission with no clinical signs or symptoms of COVID-19 infection. Only 2 patients presented with hypoxia. However, 5 out of the 10 patients - including the patients who presented with hypoxia - subsequently required supplemental oxygen postoperatively. Two patients were successfully weaned off supplemental oxygen by postoperative day 2 and 1 patient was weaned off supplemental oxygen by postoperative day 3. The remaining 2 patients, however, continued to have increased oxygen demands requiring prolonged supplemental oxygen therapy beyond postoperative day 3. Neither of these patients ultimately required mechanical ventilation. Only 1 patient in our series had a presumed VTE postoperatively and this patient subsequently died on postoperative day 19, likely secondary to respiratory failure. There were no other deaths in the early postoperative period in this series of COVID-positive hip fracture patients who underwent urgent surgical intervention at our institution.\nCOVID-19 symptoms vary substantially among patients, ranging from no symptoms to respiratory failure. Mild presentations may include flu-like symptoms, such as cough, muscle pain, sore throat, and fever. However, more severe pulmonary symptoms can also occur, with patients such as the elderly and those with existing comorbidities being at particularly high risk for dyspnea, interstitial pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multi-organ dysfunction. Hip fracture patients represent a high-risk population, as they are generally older with multiple medical comorbidities. Extensive literature has consistently demonstrated the benefits of early hip fracture surgery for elderly patients, which include reducing bed rest, promoting early mobilization, controlling pain, improving function, and reducing mortality. However, the high risk associated with severe respiratory dysfunction and pneumonia secondary to COVID-19 infection may represent a contraindication to urgent hip fracture surgery in COVID-positive patients. Furthermore, in patients who proceed to hip fracture surgery, pulmonary complications are known to be a significant contributor to postoperative morbidity, with the incidence of these complications estimated to be approximately 4%-9%.\nOperating room protocols for COVID-positive patients at our institution.\nFig. 1\nAt our institution, all patients who underwent surgical procedures during the COVID-19 outbreak were required to have COVID-19 diagnostic testing within 48 h of the procedure. The operating room protocols for COVID-positive patients at our institution are outlined in Fig. 1. COVID-positive patients were transported directly from their hospital room to a designated COVID-specific operating room without passing through the usual preoperative holding area. Only essential staff were permitted in the operating room, all of whom had appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), including N95 respirator masks, face shields, gowns, and gloves. Anesthesiologists utilized neuraxial or regional anesthesia when appropriate, and video laryngoscopes to assist with endotracheal intubations to reduce exposure. A designated &quot;runner&quot; outside the operating room was available to retrieve any required equipment or supplies throughout the procedure, in order to limit incoming and outgoing traffic in the operating room. After completion of the surgical procedure, COVID-positive patients remained in the operating room for post-anesthesia care and recovery, with the recovery room nurse coming into the operating room to provide care. After patients had satisfactorily completed their post-anesthesia care, they were transported directly from the operating room back to their hospital room.\nThere has been limited information available on the presenting characteristics and outcomes of COVID-positive patients with hip fractures. Mi et al. published one of the first reports on the characteristics and early prognosis of patients with a fracture and COVID-19 infection in China. In their series of 10 patients, 6 had sustained hip fractures and only 3 underwent surgery. These 3 patients did not present with any severe symptoms on admission or have any clear evidence of COVID-19 infection on CT scans, and thus, proceeded with surgical intervention. All 3 patients were observed to have fever and cough postoperatively, and 2 of the patients had symptoms of dyspnea. One of the 3 patients died on postoperative day 11, while the other 2 patients remained in the hospital for further treatment.\nAnother study by Catellani et al. reported on a series of 16 COVID-positive patients with proximal femoral fractures in northern Italy, of which 13 underwent surgical treatment. All of the patients in this series reported symptoms of fever and dyspnea prior to admission, and had signs of oxygen desaturation on room air upon presentation to the emergency room. The majority of patients in this study demonstrated significant improvements in oxygen saturation and respiratory function following surgery. However, 4 out of the 13 patients (30.8%) died with the first week after surgery. High early mortality rates in COVID-positive hip fracture patients were also reported in another study in Italy by Maniscalco et al. In this cohort, 32 COVID-positive hip patients were treated surgically, and there was a 43.8% (14/32) mortality rate within 21 days. These early reports from China and Italy suggested a higher rate of mortality in the early postoperative period for patients with a hip fracture and COVID-19 infection.\nSimilar findings have also been reported in a more recent study in Spain. A multicenter, observational study from 13 major hospitals in Spain examined the early mortality rate in 136 hip fracture patients who were treated surgically or nonoperatively during the COVID-19 pandemic. Of the 62 patients who were tested for COVID-19 in their cohort, 23 patients had positive test results. The early mortality rate in this group of COVID-positive hip fracture patients was approximately 3 times higher than that for COVID-negative hip fracture patients. This was consistent with the high early mortality rates noted in the earlier reports from China and Italy.\nThe findings from our cohort of 10 COVID-positive hip fracture patients in New York City who underwent surgical treatment differed from the above mentioned studies in China and Europe. The early mortality rate in this series was only 10%. However, it is important to note that nearly all of our COVID-positive patients were asymptomatic or had only mild symptoms on presentation. The 3 hip fractures patients who underwent surgery in Mi et al.'s study similarly had no severe symptoms on admission, but the 13 patients in Catellani et al.'s study all presented with evidence of symptomatic COVID-19 infection. This difference in the presentation of COVID-19 symptoms on admission likely contributed to the observed discrepancy in early mortality rates between our patient cohort and those of prior studies.\nIn our study, nearly half of the patients had an inpatient stay &gt;=7 days, and the average LOS among discharged patients was 7.8 days. This is slightly longer than the average LOS after hip fracture surgery reported in past studies, which has ranged between 5 and 6 days. Three of the 4 patients in our cohort who had a LOS &gt;=7 days had increased oxygen demands postoperatively and required prolonged administration of supplemental oxygen therapy beyond the second postoperative day. The fourth patient had a postoperative AKI that required treatment with intravenous fluids over several days. These postoperative complications likely contributed to the longer inpatient stay.\nThis study has several limitations. First, we had a small sample size of COVID-19-positive patients who underwent hip fracture surgery, despite being an institution in the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States. However, this sample size was comparable to existing case series in the literature. Second, we limited our inclusion criteria to patients who underwent surgical intervention. This excluded patients with hip fractures and COVID-19 infection who were deemed to be unsuitable candidates for surgery for reasons such as medical instability from existing comorbidities or severe COVID-19 infection. Therefore, our findings should not be extrapolated to hip fracture patients with severe presentations of COVID-19 infection. Third, the short follow-up period may have resulted in an underestimation of the mortality rate. Longer term follow-up will be needed to assess morbidity and mortality beyond the early postoperative period. Lastly, our study population was limited to only patients within the New York metropolitan area, thereby potentially limiting generalizability to patient populations in other geographic regions with different baseline demographics and comorbidity profiles.\nIn conclusion, this study described the clinical characteristics and early outcomes after hip fracture surgery in patients who presented with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 infection in New York City. Despite the absence of clinical signs and symptoms of COVID-19 infection in nearly all of these patients on admission, half of these patients subsequently had increased oxygen demand postoperatively requiring supplemental oxygen therapy. However, more than half of these patients who had increased oxygen demand postoperatively were successfully weaned off oxygen therapy within 3 days after surgery. Furthermore, the mortality rate in the early postoperative period in our series was only 10%, which is in contrast to the higher mortality rates reported from studies in China and Europe. Our findings suggest that hip fracture patients who present with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 infection may have temporarily increased oxygen demands postoperatively, but they can safely undergo early surgical intervention after appropriate medical optimization.\nInstitutional Review Board approval\nIRB approval was obtained for the submitted work at our institution.\nFunding\nThis research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.\nDeclaration of competing interest\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.\nReferences\nReduced rate of hospital admissions for ACS during Covid-19 outbreak in northern Italy\nDelay from fracture to hospital admission: a new risk factor for hip fracture mortality?\nDelay in hip fracture surgery: an analysis of patient-specific and hospital-specific risk factors\nAssociation between wait time and 30-day mortality in adults undergoing hip fracture surgery\nEarly mortality after hip fracture: is delay before surgery important?\nThe impact of time to surgery after hip fracture on mortality at 30- and 90-days: does a single benchmark apply to all?\nCharacteristics and early prognosis of COVID-19 infection in fracture patients\nTreatment of proximal femoral fragility fractures in patients with COVID-19 during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in northern Italy\nMortality rates of patients with proximal femoral fracture in a worldwide pandemic: preliminary results of the Spanish HIP-COVID observational study\nCOVID-19 diagnosis and management: a comprehensive review\nMedical complications and outcomes after hip fracture repair\nClinical characteristics and risk factors of postoperative pneumonia after hip fracture surgery: a propective cohort study\nProximal femur fractures in COVID-19 emergency: the experience of two orthopedics and traumatology departments in the first eight weeks of the Italian epidemic\nMortality rate of geriatric acetabular fractures is high compared to hip fractures.
