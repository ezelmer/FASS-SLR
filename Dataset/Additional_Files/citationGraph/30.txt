With the increasing number of infected cases and deaths, many patients experienced both physical suffering and great psychological distress. In China, a range of guidelines and expert consensus have been developed by health authorities and academic associations. Crisis mental health interventions, such as online education and counseling services, have been widely adopted nationwide (Liu et al.,).\nAccording to the treatment guidelines in China, COVID-19 patients need to be treated in isolated hospitals. Due to social isolation, perceived danger, uncertainty, physical discomfort, medication side effects, fear of virus transmission to others, and negative news on social media, patients with COVID-19 may experience loneliness, anger, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and posttraumatic stress symptoms (Wu, Chan, &amp; Ma,; Xiang et al.,), which could negatively affect individuals' social and occupational functioning, and quality of life (Monson, Caron, McCloskey, &amp; Brunet,; North et al.,). To date, no studies on the pattern of posttraumatic stress symptoms among COVID-19 patients have been reported. Therefore, we examined the pattern of posttraumatic stress symptoms in clinically stable COVID-19 patients. We also explored patients' attitude toward crisis mental health services during the COVID-19 outbreak.\nOnline assessment was incorporated as part of the crisis psychological interventions. Patients were invited to participate in this online assessment prior to their discharge from five quarantine facilities ('Fang Cang' hospitals) in Wuhan, Hubei province in March 2020. 'Fang Cang' hospitals refer to temporary quarantine hospital facilities converted from gymnasiums, exhibition centers and sports centers for clinically stable patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. To be eligible, participants should be adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19 verified by patients' medical records, and clinically stable, as screened by patients' case medical officers. Participants were asked about their attitudes toward COVID-19-related online crisis mental health services, such as psycho-educational resources, and mental health counseling, using a standardized question: 'Do you think online psycho-educational resources and mental health counseling provision during the COVID-19 outbreak are helpful?' (yes/no). The amended self-reported Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Checklist- Civilian Version (PCL-C) (Weathers, Litz, Herman, Huska, &amp; Keane,) was used to assess the severity of the posttraumatic stress symptoms associated with the COVID-19. A total PCL-C score of &gt;=50 was considered 'having significant posttraumatic stress symptoms' (Yang, Yang, Liu, &amp; Yang,).\nA total of 730 COVID-19 patients were recruited in this study, of whom, 714 met the inclusion criteria. The mean age of the participants was 50.2 +- 12.9 years, men accounted for 49.1% of the sample, and 25.8% lived alone prior to admission. The prevalence of significant posttraumatic stress symptoms associated with the COVID-19 was 96.2% (95% CI 94.8-97.6%). Half of the participants (49.8%) considered psycho-educational services helpful.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this was the first study examining the prevalence of posttraumatic stress symptoms in COVID-19 patients. It is noteworthy that most COVID-19 patients suffered from significant posttraumatic stress symptoms associated with the disease prior to discharge, and these symptoms may lead to negative outcomes, such as lower quality of life and impaired working performance. Following the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the prevalence of PTSD in SARS survivors was 9.79% in their early recovery phase (Fang, Zhe, &amp; Shuran,) and 25.6% at 30-month post-SARS assessment (Mak, Chu, Pan, Yiu, &amp; Chan,). Our findings were significantly higher than that of Fang's and Mak's. The remarkable differences between these studies could be attributed to different clinical diagnosis and illness phrases (e.g., clinically stable COVID-19 inpatients vs. SARS survivors) and different measurements (e.g., self-reported instrument on posttraumatic stress symptoms associated with the COVID-19 vs. clinical diagnosis of PTSD established by professionals). The rapid transmission of COVID-19 alongside with demeaning news coverage in widely used communication programs (e.g. WeChat and Weibo), and social discrimination toward COVID-19 patients may result in higher prevalence of self-perceived posttraumatic stress symptoms associated with the COVID-19 in this study.\nOf particular note was that only half of the patients hold positive attitudes toward online crisis mental health services. During the COVID-19 outbreak, most crisis mental health services for infected patients are delivered online. Many COVID-19 patients were older adults with limited time, and restricted access to internet and smartphones due to poor health status during hospitalization (Yang et al.,). Compared with on-site psychological interventions, online self-guided psycho-educational resources could be less effective, especially for those with reading difficulties and physical discomfort brought by COVID-19 and treatment side effects.\nIn conclusion, this study found that most clinically stable COVID-19 patients suffered from significant posttraumatic stress symptoms associated with the COVID-19 prior to discharge. Considering the negative detrimental impact of significant posttraumatic stress symptoms, appropriate crisis psychological interventions and long-term follow-up assessments should be urgently initiated for COVID-19 survivors.\nFinancial support\nThe study was supported by the University of Macau (MYRG2019-00066-FHS).\nConflicts of interest\nNone.\nReferences\nSurvey on mental status of

the last.\n\n This study aimed to evaluate the long-term psychiatric morbidities in survivors of SARS.\n\n\nMethod\nThis is a cohort study designed to investigate psychiatric complications among SARS survivors treated in the United Christian Hospital 30 months after the SARS outbreak.\n\n Psychiatric morbidities were assessed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, the Impact of Events Scale–Revised and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.\n\n Functional outcomes were assessed by the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey.\n\n\nResults\nNinety subjects were recruited, yielding a response rate of 96.8%.\n\n Post-SARS cumulative incidence of DSM-IV psychiatric disorders was 58.9%.\n\n Current prevalence for any psychiatric disorder at 30 months post-SARS was 33.3%.\n\n One-fourth of the patients had post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and 15.6% had depressive disorders.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe outbreak of SARS can be regarded as a mental health catastrophe.\n\n PTSD was the most prevalent long-term psychiatric condition, followed by depressive disorders.\n\n Our results highlight the need to enhance preparedness and competence of health care professionals in detecting and managing the psychological sequelae of future comparable infectious disease outbreaks.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7112501","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family

The availability of strict infection control guidelines, specialized equipment, recognition of their efforts by hospital management and the government, and reduction in reported cases of COVID-19 provided psychological benefit.\nConclusions\nThe COVID-19 outbreak in Hubei resulted in increased stress for medical staff in adjacent Hunan province. Continued acknowledgment of the medical staff by hospital management and the government, provision of infection control guidelines, specialized equipment and facilities for the management of COVID-19 infection should be recognized as factors that may encourage medical staff to work during future epidemics.\nBackground\nSince the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak began in Hubei province from November 2019, frontline medical staff throughout China have experienced an increase in workload, increased working hours, and increased psychological stress. According to previous studies, during the outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), frontline medical staff had reported high levels of stress that resulted in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The risk factors of psychological stress in medical staff had been previously investigated during the SARS and MERS epidemics. In 2008, Styra et al., in Toronto, identified four major risk factors for stress in medical staff during the SARS outbreak, including the perception of the medical of their risk of infection, the impact of SARS on their work, feelings of depression, and working in high-risk medical units. The perception of infection risk by medical staff was previously reported by Tam et al. in 2003 to be significantly associated with their risk of developing PTSD. Other factors, including social stigmatization and contact with infected patients, has previously been shown to be associated with increased levels of stress and anxiety in medical staff.\nAlthough recent reports have shown that 80% of patients with COVID-19 have mild symptoms and will recover and the mortality rate is low at up to 2%, because of the high transmission rate, total mortality from COVID-19 is greater than SARS and MRES combined. Recently, Peeri et al. reported that the infection rate of medical staff during the SARS and MERS outbreaks reached 21% and 18.6%, respectively, which resulted in adverse psychological effects, including anxiety and depression. Medical staff have been infected and have died during the COVID-19 epidemic in China, there are no treatments for this infection, and no vaccines have been developed. All these factors contribute to increased psychological stress of frontline medical staff in China, which may have immediate or long-psychological consequences that may have acute or chronic somatic effects that result in conditions such as cardiac arrhythmia and myocardial infarction. However, there have been few studies that have investigated the coping strategies that frontline medical staff can use during disease epidemics. Personality traits, such as optimism, resilience, and altruism, have previously been shown to have positive effects on reducing psychological stress. Objective measures may reduce psychological stress, including effective infection control, personal protective measures, clear institutional policies and protocols, which may help to reduce stress in medical staff. Recognition and appreciation of the work and efforts by the medical profession, hospital management, government, and society have a positive impact on stress experienced by medical staff during epidemics. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the psychological impact and coping strategies of frontline medical staff in Hunan province, adjacent to Hubei province, during the COVID-19 outbreak between January and March 2020.\nMaterial and Methods\nEthical approval\nA cross-sectional observational study included doctors, nurses, and other hospital staff throughout Hunan province between January and March 2020. The Institutional Review Board of the 3rd Xiangya Hospital of Central South University provided ethical approval for this study.\nStudy participants\nQuestionnaires were sent to frontline medical staff who were working during the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The participants included doctors and nurses from departments of infectious diseases, emergency medicine, fever clinics, and intensive care units, and included technicians from radiology and laboratory medicine, and hospital staff from the section of infection prevention. A questionnaire was used that was previously designed by Lee et al., which was used to evaluate medical staff during the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic. The questionnaire was modified for this study and included five sections with 67 questions. All participants were required to understand the meaning of the question and to answer the questions on their own.\nStudy questionnaire\nThe first section of the questionnaire included 14 questions that examined the feelings of the medical staff during the COVID-19 outbreak. Each question had four choices on a four-point scale (0=not at all; 1=slightly; 2=moderately; 3=very much). The second section investigated 19 possible factors that could induce stress for the medical staff (0=not at all; 1=slightly; 2=moderately; 3=very much). The third section included 14 questions to identify factors that might reduce their stress (0=never; 1=sometimes; 2=often; 3=always). The fourth section included 11 questions, which aimed to identify personal coping strategies in response to the stress of the outbreak, with four choices with responses that ranged from not important to most important (scores, 0-3). The fifth section included questions on what would encourage medical staff to be more confident in future outbreaks and included nine questions, consisting of four choices with responses that ranged from not important to most important (scores, 0-3).\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis of the data was performed with GraphPad Prism version 7.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). The chi-squared chi2 test was used to compare the responses between professional groups, age-groups, and gender for the first four sections of the questionnaire. Descriptive statistics were used to present the data collected from the survey and included the mean, standard deviation (SD), and median of the data collected for all the sections. A P-value&lt;0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.\nResults\nCharacteristics of the study participants\nA total of 534 questionnaires were completed from 167 men and 367 women. The majority of participants were between the ages of 18-30 years (42.4%) and 31-40 years (60.7%). All the participants were working in hospitals in Hunan province. Doctors and nurses together accounted for 90% of the total participants. Most of the study participants were married (79%) and had children (76.6%). The average clinical experience was 14.5 years. Medical staff with a postgraduate degree represented the majority of the study participants (64.4%). The demographic characteristics of the study participants was shown in Table 1. All of the study participants were Chinese citizens and worked in different levels of hospital in Hunan, an adjacent province to Hubei. The questionnaires were evenly distributed to all administrative districts in Hunan. The top three participating districts were Changsha, Hengyang, and Yueyang (Figure 1), which were adjacent to the Jing-Guang Line, the most important railway and highway combining Hunan and Hubei.\nThe emotions of the medical staff in Hunan during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in Hubei\nThe emotions of the medical staff from the different medical professionals are shown in Table 2. The chi-squared chi2 test showed that differences in responses from eight of the 14 questions were statistically significant. The most important element was their social and moral responsibility, which drove them to continue working during the outbreak (P=0.03), and doctors had the highest mean score (2.47+-0.66). Medical staff also expected to receive recognition from hospital authorities (P&lt;0.001), and nurses had more concerns regarding extra financial compensation during or after the outbreak when compared with other healthcare workers (P=0.002). However, nursing staff also felt more nervous and anxious when on the ward when compared with other groups (P=0.02). Doctors were more unhappy about working overtime during the COVID-19 outbreak than other healthcare workers (P=0.02). There was no significant difference between the medical professionals for regarding stopping work, and work overload.\nFactors that caused stress, according to the age of the medical staff\nThe study population was divided into four age-groups (Table 3). The main factors associated with stress were concerns for personal safety (P&lt;0.001), concerns for their families (P&lt;0.001), and concerns for patient mortality (P=0.001). Medical staff in the 31-40 year age-group were more worried about infecting their families compared with other groups (2.46+-0.72). Staff&gt;50 years of age felt greater stress when seeing their patients die. Worry about their own safety were also an important factor in anxiety in medical staff, particularly in the group aged 41-50 years. Lack of protective clothing (P=0.0195) and exhaustion due to increased duration of working (P=0.03) were also significantly increased in older staff. Stress from other colleagues affected staff &gt;50 years old when compared with other groups (P=0.0034). The safety of their colleagues and the lack of treatment for COVID-19 were considered to be important factors that inducd stress in all medical staff, with no significant differences between the study groups.\nFactors that helped to reduce stress of medical staff during the COVID-19 outbreak, according to gender\nSection 3 of the study questionnaire aimed to identify could directly or indirectly help to reduce stress for a COVID-19 outbreak according to the previous severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreaks, and these were evaluated in Section 3 (Table 4). In this section, we would like to look for differences from the sexual perspective. The safety of family was the biggest impact in reducing staff stress (P=0.37&gt;0.05), though there are no significant difference in different genders. However, factors like correct guidance and effective safeguards for prevention from disease transmission eased more female staff anxiety (P&lt;0.001). The positive attitude from their colleagues was also important factor to reduce staff distress during the outbreak (P=0.04). In general, factors of reducing stress had larger impact on female staff than male ones.\nPersonal coping strategies used by the medical staff to reduce stress among professionals\nSection 4 of the study questionnaire was designed to provide insights into the personal coping strategies used by the different professional groups of the medical staff (Table 5). Strategies, such as strict protective measures, knowledge of virus prevention and transmission, social isolation measures, and positive self-attitude resulted in the highest scores (mean scores &lt;2.5), with nurses giving the highest scores in every question. Seeking help from family and friends was a significant supportive measure (P&lt;0.001). Medical staff did not express a significant wish to reduce stress by consulting a psychologist to discuss their emotions, especially in the populations of doctors and medical technicians.\nMotivational factors to encourage continuation of work in future outbreaks of infection\nSection 5 of the study questionnaire included questions for the medical staff about motivators to continue working during any future COVID-19 or other epidemic outbreaks (Table 6). Adequate protective equipment provided by the hospitals was considered to be the most important motivational factor to encourage continuation of work in future outbreaks. The availability of strict infection control guidelines, specialized equipment, recognition of their efforts by hospital management and the government, and reduction in reported cases of COVID-19 provided psychological benefit.\nDiscussion\nFrontline medical staff during epidemics of infectious disease include doctors and nurses from departments of infectious disease, emergency medicine, fever clinics, and intensive care units, and technicians mainly from radiology and laboratory medicine, and hospital staff from infection control. Previous studies during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreaks have shown that medical staff are not only under stress during epidemics, but they may also suffer psychologically long after the initial outbreak is over. Although each epidemic has significant differences due to geographic location, pathogen characteristics, route of transmission, infectivity, mortality rate, and availability of treatments, based on previous studies, epidemics have a significant impact on the psychological wellbeing of medical staff. The present study was the first to investigate the psychological effects of the recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hubei, China, on the medical staff of Hunan province, from the aspects of emotions, perceived stressors, and coping strategies. This study also investigated motivational factors that might encourage the continuation of work in future similar outbreaks.\nDongting Lake separates the adjacent provinces of Hunan and Hubei, which have similar cultures and are linked by transportation, and there is frequent migration between these two provinces. Therefore, the development of an epidemic in Hubei province is likely to affect Hunan, and the degree of clinical work and psychological stress of medical staff in Hunan is second only to that of Hubei. An understanding of psychological effects, perceived stressors, and coping strategies from the Hunan medical staff is important and may have implications for medical staff in other Chinese provinces, and other countries.\nThe findings from the present study showed that frontline medical staff experienced emotional stress during the COVID-19 outbreak, which has been supported by previous studies on other epidemics, although their extent differs. However, in the present study, expectations of financial compensation during or after the outbreak were not established, which differed from other studies. However, medical staff in Hunan expected recognition from the health authorities, as reported during previous epidemics. Also, the most important factors that motivated them to continue working were their social and moral responsibilities and professional obligations.\nFor medical staff in Hunan, safety from infection was the main concern as they worried most that they might infect their families with COVID-19. Medical staff between 31-40 years of age had the greatest concern regarding viral transmission to their families, possibly because most of them had young children and living parents in their families. These findings were also reported among medical staff during the SARS epidemic but were less significant. Another cause of stress for the medical staff in this study was an awareness of the mortality rate from COVID-19 infection. All age groups in this study expressed psychological stress when they saw their colleagues under stress. Therefore, hospital managers and governments should improve interventions for preventing the spread of epidemics, promote disease treatment methods, and also offer psychological support for medical staff. In the present study, the study participants showed less concern regarding the new cases and lack of treatment for COVID-19, which was not consistent with previous studies during other infectious disease epidemics. Medical staff were satisfied with current protection measures, the numbers of medical staff, medical equipment, and medical resources, although these were identified as problems by the general public and the media. This finding might be explained because, at the time of this study, the COVID-19 epidemic in Hunan was not as severe as that in Wuhan and Hubei, and disease prevention measures in Hunan were being instigated, and medical workers and the general population were better informed about these measures.\nPrevious studies have shown that gender differences exist regarding the ability to cope with stress. Women in society and at work are more likely than men to develop social and personal mechanisms to cope with stress. The responses to the questionnaires in the present study showed that the most important factor that helped ease the stress of the medical staff was when their family was well, not infected with COVID-19, and were not believed to be at risk of infection. A positive working environment with the re-assurance of personal safety while at work during the COVID-19 epidemic were the two main factors that might be key to encourage medical staff to continue working during the epidemic. Also, awareness of the effects of disease prevention measures with reduced numbers of reported cases reduced staff stress. Financial or other forms of remuneration were not significant concerns by medical staff in this study. The personal coping strategies that were used by medical staff to reduce stress during the COVID-19 epidemic is an important topic to investigate that requires further long-term studies as in China and throughout the world. During this study, medical staff in Hunan who were under stress from the COVID-19 epidemic were reassured by the implementation of clear disease prevention guidelines, including handwashing, the use of face masks, and protective clothing.\nRecently, Cheng et al. commented that with the development of the COVID-19 epidemic, infection control was important as there is still no vaccine or antiviral therapy, but that testing based on the identification of viral RNA using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based tests may show false-negatives. Li et al. have recently reported that both anti-virus IgM and IgG could be used for confirmed diagnosis when molecular testing is negative. Screening of all individuals with a fever is recommended, and awareness of aerosol and droplet spread of COVID-19 has supported avoiding social gatherings and public transport. During infectious disease epidemics, support from family and friends, as well as a positive attitude, have previously been shown to reduce stress. However, in China, medical staff are less likely to seek help from a psychologist or to express their emotions, when compared with medical staff in western countries.\nThere have been recent epidemics with novel forms of coronavirus that have included the SARS outbreak in 2003, and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak in 2014, which are now followed by the COVID-19 outbreak from 2019. In 2005, Wang et al. reported the findings from a study on the psychological impact of the SARS outbreak on emergency healthcare workers. The findings showed that psychological stress was greatest for emergency nurses, followed by emergency doctors, and then for healthcare assistants. This previous study showed that the most important variables associated with stress included loss of control and vulnerability to infection, the fear for personal health, and the spread of the novel virus. The most common coping strategies by emergency medical staff were previously reported to include acceptance of the medical situation, the active use of coping strategies, and positive framing or outlook while working.\nThis study had several limitations. The study was designed as a cross-sectional observational study that included doctors, nurses, and other hospital staff throughout Hunan province and was of short duration, conducted between January and March 2020. However, psychological stress can accumulate over time and have an impact later in the outbreak, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which should be investigated in future studies. Also, although the staff included in this study were all from frontline medical departments that included departments of infectious diseases, emergency medicine, fever clinics, intensive care units, radiology, and laboratory medicine, this study did not analyze the differences between workers in different departments. Following the findings from this preliminary observational study, the risk factors associated with the psychological impact of the COVID-19 infection should be investigated in future long-term studies. Because this was a cross-sectional study, the effects of continuous changes on the psychological status of medical workers were not studied. Finally, the data from this study was based on subjective responses using questionnaires, and in future studies, these findings should be supported by objective measurements of stress.\nConclusions\nThis study aimed to investigate the psychological impact and coping strategies of frontline medical staff in Hunan province, adjacent to Hubei province, during the COVID-19 outbreak between January and March 2020. The findings showed that the COVID-19 epidemic in Hubei resulted in increased workload and stress for medical staff in the adjacent province of Hunan. The main factors associated with stress included the perceived risk of infection to themselves and their families, patient mortality, the availability of clear infection control guidance, the availability of effective protective equipment, recognition of their work by hospital authorities, and a decrease in reported cases of COVID-19. Staff support and the provision of facilities and equipment by hospital managers and the government are required to retain and encourage medical staff involvement in future epidemics.\nConflict of interest\nNone.\nSource of support: Grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 81700658 and 81974079), the National Science and Technology Major Project (No. 2017ZX10202203), the Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province (No. 2016JJ4105), and the New Xiangya Talent Project of the Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University (No. JY201629)\nReferences\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Hong Kong in, 2003: Stress and psychological impact among frontline healthcare workers\nPsychological impact of the, 2015 MERS outbreak on hospital workers and quarantined hemodialysis patients\nImpact on health care workers employed in high-risk areas during the Toronto SARS outbreak\nCoronavirus covid-19 has killed more people than SARS and MERS combined, despite lower case fatality rate\nThe SARS, MERS and novel coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemics, the newest and biggest global health threats: What lessons have we learned?\nThe psychological impact of the SARS epidemic on hospital employees in China: Exposure, risk perception, and altruistic acceptance of risk\nMental stress and human cardiovascular disease\nMental Health of Nurses Working at a Government-designated Hospital During a MERS-CoV Outbreak: A Cross-sectional Study\nRisk perception and impact of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) on work and personal lives of healthcare workers in Singapore: what can we learn?\nHealthcare workers emotions, perceived stressors and coping strategies during a MERS-CoV outbreak\nFacing SARS: psychological impacts on SARS team nurses and psychiatric services in a Taiwan general hospital\nThe role of risk perception in willingness to respond to the, 2014-2016 West African Ebola outbreak: A qualitative study of international health care workers\nThe psychological effect of severe acute respiratory syndrome on emergency department staff\nComprehensive systematic review of healthcare workers' perceptions of risk and use of coping strategies towards emerging respiratory infectious diseases\nPandemic and public health controls: Toward an equitable compensation system\nLong-term psychological and occupational effects of providing hospital healthcare during SARS outbreak\nCoping with stress: Gender differences among college students\nRisk perception of a chronic threat of terrorism: Differences based on coping types, gender and exposure\nPreparedness and proactive infection control measures against the emerging novel coronavirus in China\nDevelopment and Clinical Application of A Rapid IgM-IgG Combined Antibody Test for SARS-CoV-2 Infection Diagnosis\nStepping up infection control measures in ophthalmology during the novel coronavirus outbreak: An experience from Hong Kong\nThe psychological impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak on healthcare workers in emergency departments and how they cope\nThe distribution of the study participants from Hunan province, China, during the epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) between January and March 2020.

a lack of trust in, and goodwill towards, the NHS; a lack of information about the risks and what is expected of them during the crisis; fear of litigation; and the feeling that employers do not take the needs of staff seriously.\n\n Barriers to ability and barriers to willingness, however, are difficult to separate out.\n\n\nConclusion\nAlthough our participants tended to feel a general obligation to work during an influenza pandemic, there are barriers to working, which, if generalisable, may significantly reduce the NHS workforce during a pandemic.\n\n The barriers identified are both barriers to willingness and to ability.\n\n This suggests that pandemic planning needs to take into account the possibility that staff may be absent for reasons beyond those currently anticipated in UK planning documents.\n\n In particular, staff who are physically able to attend work may nonetheless be unwilling to do so.\n\n Although there are some barriers that cannot be mitigated by employers (such as illness, transport infrastructure etc.\n\n), there are a number of remedial steps that can be taken to lesson the impact of others (providing accommodation, building reciprocity, provision of information and guidance etc).\n\n We suggest that barriers to working lie along an ability/willingness continuum, and that absenteeism may be reduced by taking steps to prevent barriers to willingness becoming perceived barriers to ability.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2654560","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Jonathan","surname":"Ives","email":"j.c.ives@bham.ac.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sheila","surname":"Greenfield","email":"s.m.greenfield@bham.ac.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jayne M","surname":"Parry","email":"parryjm@adf.bham.ac.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Heather","surname":"Draper","email":"h.j.a.draper@bham.ac.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Christine","surname":"Gratus","email":"christine@gratus.net","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Judith I","surname":"Petts","email":"j.i.petts@bham.ac.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tom","surname":"Sorell","email":"t.sorell@bham.ac.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sue","surname":"Wilson","email":"s.wilson@bham.ac.uk","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The social amplification of risk - assessing 15 years of research and theory","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1111/j.1539-6924.1988.tb01168.x","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The social amplification of risk: a conceptual framework","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1111/j.0272-4332.2004.00433.x","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Risk as analysis and risk as feelings: some thoughts about affect, reason, risk, and rationality","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1037/0003-066X.35.2.151","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Feeling and thinking: preferences need no inferences","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1080/13698570802380891","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Heading into the unknown: everyday strategies for managing risk and uncertainty","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1080/13645570701401305","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Sampling knowledge: the hermeneutics of snowball sampling in qualitative research","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1177/1049732305276687","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Three approaches to qualitative content analysis","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1126/science.185.4157.1124","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Judgment under uncertainty: heuristics and biases","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The immediate psychological and occupational impact of the 2003 SARS outbreak in a teaching hospital","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Koh D, Lim MK, Chia SE, Ko SM, Qian F, Ng V, et al.

The questionnaire was restricted to respondents who had to authenticate their RNAO membership with a valid username and password before accessing the questionnaire.\n\n This served a dual purpose: to ensure that only RNAO nurses completed the questionnaire and thereby safeguarding the generalizability of the findings; and second, to prevent any one nurse from contributing more than once to the overall sample.\n\n\nResults\nCorrelational analysis yielded several significant relationships between psychosocial variables and working conditions, and the traditional correlates of burnout and stress.\n\n Three multiple regression analysis revealed that the model we evolved—including higher levels of vigor, organizational support, and trust in equipment/infection control initiative; and lower levels of contact with SARS patients, and time spent in quarantine—predicted to lower levels of avoidance behavior, emotional exhaustion, and state anger.\n\n\nConclusions\nBy employing models of stress and burnout that combine psychosocial variables and working conditions, researchers can account for significant amounts of variance in outcomes related to burnout.\n\n These findings highlight the importance of vigor and perceived organizational support in predicting nurses’ symptoms of burnout.\n\n For healthcare administrators, this means that a likely strategy for assuaging the negative outcomes of stress should address nurses’ psychosocial concerns and the working conditions that they face during novel times of crisis.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7094220","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Zdravko","surname":"Marjanovic","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Esther R.","surname":"Greenglass","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sue","surname":"Coffey","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.healthplace.2017.03.016","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Navigating &quot;riskscapes&quot;: the experiences of international health care workers responding to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1080/1366987032000105315","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Perception of risk: the influence of general trust, and general confidence","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1111/0272-4332.203034","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Salient value similarity, social trust, and risk/benefit perception","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Siegrist M, Cvetkovich G.

(SARSCoV).\n\n We did clinical and experimental studies to assess the role of this virus in the cause of SARS.\n\n\nMethods\nWe tested clinical and postmortem samples from 436 SARS patients in six countries for infection with SARSCoV, human metapneumovirus, and other respiratory pathogens.\n\n We infected four cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) with SARS-CoV in an attempt to replicate SARS and did necropsies on day 6 after infection.\n\n\nFindings\nSARS-CoV infection was diagnosed in 329 (75%) of 436 patients fitting the case definition of SARS; human metapneumovirus was diagnosed in 41 (12%) of 335, and other respiratory pathogens were diagnosed only sporadically.\n\n SARS-CoV was, therefore, the most likely causal agent of SARS.\n\n The four SARS-CoV-infected macaques excreted SARS-CoV from nose, mouth, and pharynx from 2 days after infection.\n\n Three of four macaques developed diffuse alveolar damage, similar to that in SARS patients, and characterised by epithelial necrosis, serosanguineous exudate, formation of hyaline membranes, type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia, and the presence of syncytia.\n\n SARS-CoV was detected in pneumonic areas by virus isolation and RT-PCR, and was localised to alveolar epithelial cells and syncytia by immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy.\n\n\nInterpretation\nReplication in SARS-CoV-infected macaques of pneumonia similar to that in human beings with SARS, combined with the high prevalence of SARS-CoV infection in SARS patients, fulfill the criteria required to prove that SARS-CoV is the primary cause of SARS.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7112434","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe analysed case notes and microbiological findings for 50 patients with SARS, representing more than five separate epidemiologically linked transmission clusters.\n\n We defined the clinical presentation and risk factors associated with severe disease and investigated the causal agents by chest radiography and laboratory testing of nasopharyngeal aspirates and sera samples.\n\n We compared the laboratory findings with those submitted for microbiological investigation of other diseases from patients whose identity was masked.\n\n\nFindings\nPatients' age ranged from 23 to 74 years.\n\n Fever, chills, myalgia, and cough were the most frequent complaints.\n\n When compared with chest radiographic changes, respiratory symptoms and auscultatory findings were disproportionally mild.\n\n Patients who were household contacts of other infected people and had older age, lymphopenia, and liver dysfunction were associated with severe disease.\n\n A virus belonging to the family Coronaviridae was isolated from two patients.\n\n By use of serological and reverse-transcriptase PCR specific for this virus, 45 of 50 patients with SARS, but no controls, had evidence of infection with this virus.\n\n\nInterpretation\nA coronavirus was isolated from patients with SARS that might be the primary agent associated with this disease.\n\n Serological and molecular tests specific for the virus permitted a definitive laboratory diagnosis to be made and allowed further investigation to define whether other cofactors play a part in disease

Chilean respondents reported higher stress levels (19.8 vs.\n\n 17.7) and a lower Sense of Coherence (55.6 vs.\n\n 58.0) compared to Australian/New Zealand participants (p?&lt;?0.001).\n\n The SOC was positively correlated with active coping (p?&lt;?0.01) and positive reframing (p?&lt;?0.01).\n\n Profile analysis showed that when the differences in responses by sex were accounted for, there was no significant effect by country on the coping strategies used (p?&lt;?0.32).\n\n\nConclusion\nThis initial investigation provides insights into the students’ coping strategies and the validity of the SM.\n\n Students reporting high SOC scores where those who demonstrated the use of active coping and positive reframing as strategies to deal with stressful situations, which indicates the accuracy of the theoretical framework of the SM in health education environments.\n\n The results also suggest that a distinctive coping strategy pattern may apply to all participants, regardless of their country and sex.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12909-016-0740-z) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized

distress via certain coping strategies in several different racial and ethnic groups, but few of these studies included indigenous populations.\n\n Elucidating modifiable factors for intervention to reduce the adverse effects of racism on psychological well-being is another avenue to addressing health inequities.\n\n\nMethods\nWe examined the potential mediating effects of 14 distinct coping strategies on the relationship between perceived racism and psychological distress in a community-based sample of 145 Native Hawaiians using structural equation modeling.\n\n\nResults\nPerceived racism had a significant indirect effect on psychological distress, mediated through venting and behavioral disengagement coping strategies, with control for age, gender, educational level, and marital status.\n\n\nDiscussion\nThe findings suggest that certain coping strategies may exacerbate the deleterious effects of racism on a person’s psychological well-being.\n\n\nConclusion\nOur study adds Native Hawaiians to the list of U.\n\nS.\n\n racial and ethnic minorities whose psychological well-being is adversely affected by

A fever clinic for triaging patients is a primary strategy against COVID-19. On January 20, 2020, the novel coronavirus was put on highest alert throughout China. On the same day, a special 24-h fever clinic was set up in the Emergency Department, Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH). Doctors and nurses for this fever clinic were handpicked by the Emergency Department based on their experience and their adaptability and tenacity under pressure shown in their past works. Psychological support for these medical workers was deemed as essential. Thus, a hotline service was set up by the Department of Psychological Medicine, from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. every day, to talk with medical workers about their feelings, provide support and understanding, and help them find emotional resources. Furthermore, we continuously monitored these medical workers with qualitative and quantitative evaluations, regularly feeding back findings to the Emergency Department to allow for adjustments.\nThe qualitative interview involved topics as shown below. Quantitative questionnaires (Table 1) included the Patient Health Questionaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Maslach Burn-out Inventory (MBI). PHQ-9 and MBI were administered at the end of their duty before a 2-week rest leave. Interviews were conducted whenever the medical workers were free, initiated either by us or them, during the 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. hotline service. Each medical worker was interviewed several times during their 2- to 3-week work time rotation. Each interview lasted 40-90 min.\nA total of 37 medical workers were selected as the first batch for the fever clinic. They all agreed to participate in our interviews and provided oral consent (response rate 100%). The participants comprised 16 doctors, 19 nurses, and 2 clinical technicians; 8 of the workers were male, and 17 were married. The overall mean age was 32.8 +- 9.6 years. Mean working experience was 6 years (range 2-20). They had all made contact with COVID-19 patients or specimens of COVID-19 patients in their work.\nFindings\nLiving conditions. In order to minimize the transmission risk to others, the medical staff had to stay and work in the hospital continuously for 2-3 weeks, then took a rest for 2 weeks in an isolated vocational resort before going home for further rest. There was a separate apartment building with an individual dormitory for each of them. They were satisfied with the living conditions.\nWork time. The work time schedule was continuously adjusted. For doctors, the schedule changed from one consecutive 12-h shift/day to one consecutive 8-h shift /day then to two 4-h shifts/day with a 4-h break in-between. For nurses, the schedule changed from one consecutive 12-h shift/day to two 4-h shifts/day with a 4-h break in-between. For technicians, it was one 5-h shift plus one 7-h shift/day, with one 5-h and one 7-h break after each shift. After 2-3 weeks of continuous work, these medical staff were replaced by a new group. Doctors and nurses gave the same feedback on ideal work time: 4-6 h/shift, 1 or 2 shifts/day, for 2 or 3 weeks. Their concentration would decrease after working long hours. Some participants said they &quot;felt tired and can't have a full sleep&quot; later in the 2- or 3-week period. Many physical and mental challenges of working continuously should be noted, such as the intensity of focus for long periods of time and wearing bulky layers of clothing. The National Health Commission has acknowledged this and issued a notice that all medical workers should work suitable shifts and get sufficient rest.\nWorkload. (1) Doctors had a heavy workload, up to 10 patients/h. They hoped there could be additional doctors in extreme situations. (2) Nurses had various duties and sometimes, at maximum, had to deal with 200 patients/day. They hoped there could be a more specified task division, as well as more nurses. (3) Technicians thought their workload was moderate and the schedule was balanced.\nMedical security. The staff generally felt safe as there were designated personnel supervising the virus protection procedures for each medical staff member. But sometimes there was a shortage of protective clothing. On a larger scale, the Chinese government has mobilized all the production and logistic powers to ensure medical material supplies.\nDiet and sleep. The participants were satisfied with the food and the sleeping environment. Dietary habits and needs were individually considered. Overall, 21.6% (8/37) of participants had low appetite, and 29.7% (11/37) had sleeping problems and occasionally needed sleeping pills.\nEmotions. (1) Doctors: 6.3% (1/16) felt nervous after hearing news on television that some doctors were infected. (2) Nurses: 52.6% (10/19) reported negative emotions including worrying about and missing family members, worrying about infection, and feeling stressed about heavy workload. (3) Technicians felt emotionally stable. In response, the logistics departments took on the responsibility of taking care of the participants' family members.\nCoping strategies. Video-chat or telephone with family members was the most frequently reported coping strategy. Talking with colleagues was also useful for most participants. Two participants reported that they would rather cope with stress on their own, but they welcomed talks with psychologists through hotline. Other coping strategies included sport, singing, writing diaries, watching videos, etc.\nBodily discomfort. Of the 37 participants, 6 doctors and 11 nurses reported mild bodily discomfort including tiredness, throat pain, cough, neck and shoulder pain, back pain, headache and nausea, frequent urination, and skin rash. No medical worker was infected with COVID-19. The above-described bodily discomforts may likely have psychosomatic origins.\nPHQ-9 and MBI (see Table 1). The higher rate of &quot;Personal Accomplishment&quot; burnout may be related to the fact there is still no definitely effective medication against COVID-19.\nConsistent with other similar situations, medical workers in our study were under high stress. However, overall, the emotional distress and burnout levels were not highly elevated. Our psychological support and adjustments may help buffer the negative impact of stress. In addition, we have to acknowledge that in such an emergency situation with a shortage of medical staff and resources, many doctors and nurses are overworking extensively. It is a new situation for medical workers. We suggest monitoring the physical and psychological needs and wellbeing of medical workers in similar situations, and then adjusting their working schedules and formulating psychosocial interventions accordingly.\nStatement of Ethics\nThe trial protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee for Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (S-K1045).

[15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical

To maintain hospital function under critical situations such as a pandemic, it is important to understand the factors that increase and decrease the willingness to work.\n\n Previous hospital-based studies have examined this question using hypothetical events, but so far it has not been examined in an actual pandemic.\n\n Here, we surveyed the factors that influenced the motivation and hesitation of hospital workers to work in Japan soon after the pandemic (H1N1) 2009.\nMethods\nSelf-administered anonymous questionnaires about demographic character and stress factors were distributed to all 3635 employees at three core hospitals in Kobe city, Japan and were collected from June to July, 2009, about one month after the pandemic (H1N1) in Japan.\n\n\nResults\nOf a total of 3635 questionnaires distributed, 1693 (46.7%) valid questionnaires were received.\n\n 28.4% (N = 481) of workers had strong motivation and 14.7% (N = 249) had strong hesitation to work.\n\n Demographic characters and stress-related questions were categorised into four types according to the odds ratios (OR) of motivation and hesitation to work: some factors increased motivation and lowered hesitation; others increased motivation only; others increased hesitation only and others increased both motivation and hesitation.\n\n The strong feeling of being supported by the national and local governments (Multivariate OR: motivation; 3.5; CI 2.2-5.4, hesitation; 0.2; CI 0.1-0.6) and being protected by hospital (Multivariate OR: motivation; 2.8; CI 2.2-3.7, hesitation; 0.5; CI 0.3-0.7) were related to higher motivation and lower hesitation.\n\n Here, protection included taking precautions to prevent illness among workers and their families, providing for the care of those who do become ill, reducing malpractice threats, and financial support for families of workers who die on duty.\n\n But 94.1% of the respondents answered protection by the national and local government was weak and 79.7% answered protection by the hospital was weak.\n\n\nConclusions\nSome factors have conflicting effects because they increase both motivation and hesitation.\n\n Giving workers the feeling that they are being protected by the national and local government and hospital is especially valuable because it increases their motivation and lowers their hesitation to work.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3091577","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Hissei","surname":"Imai","email":"hissei@kcgh.gr.jp","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kunitaka","surname":"Matsuishi","email":"kmatuisi@iris.eonet.ne.jp","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Atsushi","surname":"Ito","email":"atsushiito@aol.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kentaro","surname":"Mouri","email":"kjfqy385@ybb.ne.jp","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Noboru","surname":"Kitamura","email":"n-kitamura@hcc6.bai.ne.jp","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Keiko","surname":"Akimoto","email":"maygarden@m6.gyao.ne.jp","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Koichi","surname":"Mino","email":"mino@kobe-nishishimin-hospi.jp","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ayako","surname":"Kawazoe","email":"bunbun5211@yahoo.co.jp","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Masanori","surname":"Isobe","email":"masaniso@yahoo.co.jp","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shizuo","surname":"Takamiya","email":"kanisan@hera.eonet.ne.jp","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tatsuo","surname":"Mita","email":"mita@ja2.so-net.ne.jp","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1177/1043659605278935","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Providing care and facing death: nursing during Ebola outbreaks in Central Africa","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1046/j.1365-3156.1998.00322.x","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Survey among survivors of the 1995 Ebola epidemic in Kikwit, Democratic Republic of Congo: their feelings and experiences","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"&quot;A time of fear&quot;: local, national, and international responses to a large Ebola outbreak in Uganda","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"McMahon SA, Ho LS, Brown H, Miller L, Ansumana R, Kennedy CE.

The epidemic has brought not only the risk of death from infection but also unbearable psychological pressure. We sampled college students from Changzhi medical college by using cluster sampling. They responded to a questionnaire packet that included the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) and those inquiring the participants' basic information. We received 7,143 responses. Results indicated that 0.9% of the respondents were experiencing severe anxiety, 2.7% moderate anxiety, and 21.3% mild anxiety. Moreover, living in urban areas (OR = 0.810, 95% CI = 0.709 - 0.925), family income stability (OR = 0.726, 95% CI = 0.645 - 0.817) and living with parents (OR = 0.752, 95% CI = 0.596 - 0.950) were protective factors against anxiety. Moreover, having relatives or acquaintances infected with COVID-19 was a risk factor for increasing the anxiety of college students (OR = 3.007, 95% CI = 2.377 - 3.804). Results of correlation analysis indicated that economic effects, and effects on daily life, as well as delays in academic activities, were positively associated with anxiety symptoms (P &lt; .001). However, social support was negatively correlated with the level of anxiety (P &lt; .001). It is suggested that the mental health of college students should be monitored during epidemics.\nIntroduction\nThe novel coronavirus (COVID-2019) has spread very rapidly all over China and several other countries, causing an outbreak of acute infectious pneumonia. According to the official website of the National Health Commission of China, there were 49,824 confirmed cases (including 9915 severe cases) and 3434 suspected cases of COVID-19 in China as of 23 February 2020. This large scale, infectious, public health event, imposed enormous pressure on the Chinese government, medical and healthcare providers, and the general public. Thirty-one provinces in China initiated a Level-1 public health response. The epidemic brought not only the risk of death from the viral infection but also unbearable psychological pressure to people in China and the rest of the world. The continuous spread of the epidemic, strict isolation measures and delays in starting schools, colleges, and universities across the country is expected to influence the mental health of college students. There have been reports on the psychological impact of the epidemic on the general public, patients, medical staff, children, and older adults. However, no detailed study on the mental health status of college students facing the epidemic has been conducted to date.\nThe 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) is one of the most widely used instruments for the detection and screening of anxiety disorders, and it is a module of the 'Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ; Spitzer et al., 1999), which is the first self-reported questionnaire developed for primary care, to aid the diagnostic process of specific disorders. The GAD-7 takes less than 3 min to complete and easy to score. Today, the GAD-7 is the most widely used measure of anxiety used in clinical practice and research due to its diagnostic reliability and efficiency. It can be applied for screening, diagnosis, and the assessment of the severity of anxiety disorders, as well as for social phobia, post-traumatic stress disorders, and panic disorders.\nMethods of guiding students to effectively and appropriately regulate their emotions during public health emergencies and avoid losses caused by crisis events have become an urgent problem for colleges and universities. Therefore, we investigated and analyzed the mental health status of college students during the epidemic for the following purposes. (1) To evaluate the mental situation of college students during the epidemic; (2) to provide a theoretical basis for psychological interventions with college students; and (3) to provide a basis for the promulgation of national and governmental policies.\nObjective and methods\nStudy population and sample\nThe target population comprised undergraduates of Changzhi medical college. The respondents in the target population were sampled by cluster sampling. We assessed the mental health of these students during the COVID-19 outbreak by using structured questionnaires. The questionnaires were anonymous to ensure the confidentiality and reliability of data. Finally, 7143 respondents that completed the questionnaires were included in the final analysis (100% response rate).\nRating instruments\nThe study instrument comprised a structured questionnaire packet that inquired demographic information, including gender, region, place of residencetettlementd who diagnosed they, and source of parental income, among others. They were also inquired about their cognitions and preventive behaviors regarding COVID-19 and the availability of social support. Moreover, the participants responded to the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7). The GAD-7 includes seven items based on seven core symptoms and inquires the frequency with which respondents suffered from these symptoms within the last two weeks. Respondents report their symptoms using a 4-item Likert rating scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (almost every day), such that the total score ranges from 0 to 21. The GAD-7 is a well-validated screening instrument, and it has demonstrated excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.911).\nData analysis\nData were analyzed with SPSS Version 22.0. An analysis of descriptive statistics was conducted to illustrate the demographic and other selected characteristics of the respondents. A univariate analysis (Nonparametric test) was used to explore the significant associations between sample characteristics and the anxiety level during the COVID-19 epidemic. Statistically significant variables were screened and included in multivariate logistic regression analyses. The estimates of the strengths of associations were demonstrated by the odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Spearman's correlation coefficient, r, was used to evaluate the association between COVID-19-related stressors, including economic and daily-life related stressors, as well as stressors related to delays in academic activities, and anxiety level. A two-tailed p &lt; .05 was considered statistically significant.\nEthical considerations\nThe ethics committee of Changzhi Medical College approved this study. All participants voluntarily gave their informed consent to participate in the study after being informed about the purpose of the study. The procedures of this study complied with the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki regarding research on Human participants.\nResults\nThe demographic and selected characteristics of the study population are shown in Table 2. Among the sample of 7143 college students, approximately two-third were women 67 (0.94%). The respondents lived in Hubei Province; 43.83% lived in rural areas, 95.4% lived with their parents, and 52.86% of the parents of students did not have a steady income. Most participants (99.45%) had no relatives or acquaintances who were infected with COVID-19.\nLevels of anxiety among college students during the epidemic\nNumber of students with different anxiety level (n = 7143).\nTable 1	 	\nAnxiety Level	Number	Ratio (%)	 	Normal	5367	75.1	 	Mild	1518	21.3	 	Moderate	196	2.7	 	Severe	62	0.9	 	\n Table 1 shows how the mental health of college students was affected to varying degrees during the outbreak. Of the 7143 college students, about three-quarters (75.1%) had no symptoms of anxiety, whereas the proportions of students with mild, moderate, and severe anxiety were 21.3%, 2.7%, and 0.9%, respectively.\nFactors influencing college students' anxiety during the epidemic\nUnivariate analysis\nUnivariate analysis of College Students' Anxiety about the Epidemic.\nTable 2	 	\nVariables	Total	Normal	Anxiety level	Statistics	P	 	Mild	Moderate	Severe	 	Gender						-0.805a	0.421	 	Male	2168(30.35)	1643(75.78)	448(20.66)	51(2.35)	26(1.20)			 	Female	4975(69.65)	3724(74.85)	1070(21.51)	145(2.91)	36(0.72)			 	Region						0.292b	0.864	 	Hubei Province	67 (0.94)	49 (73.13)	16 (23.88)	2 (2.99)	0 (0.00)			 	North	5982 (83.75)	4489 (75.04)	1280 (21.40)	163 (2.72)	50 (0.84)			 	South(non-Hubei Province)	1094 (15.32)	829 (75.78)	222 (20.29)	31 (2.83)	12 (1.10)			 	Place of residence						30.550b	&lt;0.001	 	Urban	2570 (35.98)	2024(78.75)	456(17.74)	69(2.68)	21(0.82)			 	Rural-urban	1442 (20.19)	1081(74.97)	317(21.98)	35(2.43)	9(0.62)			 	Rural	3131(43.83)	2262(72.25)	745(23.79)	92(2.94)	32(1.02)			 	Steady family income						-7.262a	&lt;0.001	 	Yes	3367(47.14)	2661(79.03)	611(18.15)	74(2.20)	21(0.62)			 	No	3776((52.86)	2706(71.66)	907(24.02)	122(3.23)	41(1.09)			 	Live with parents						-2.457a	0.014	 	Yes	6789(95.04)	5119(75.40)	1434(21.12)	178(2.62)	58(0.85)			 	No	354(4.96)	248(70.06)	84(23.73)	18(5.08)	4((1.13)			 	Relative or acquaintance got COVID-19.						-3.553a	&lt;0.001	 	Yes	39(0.55)	20(51.28)	15 (38.46)	3 (7.69)	1 (2.56)			 	No	7104(99.45)	5347 (75.27)	1503 (21.16)	193 (2.72)	61 (0.86)			 	\nMann-Whitney test.\nKruskal-Wallis test.\n Table 2 shows the relationship between the demographic variables of students and anxiety.

Significance factors from the univariate analysis were included in the ordered logistic regression analysis. In the model test, P &lt; .05, indicating that the OR value of at least one variable was statistically significant. Therefore, chi 2 = 15.060, P &gt; .05, obtained in the test of parallel lines, indicated a good model fit with the observed values.\nThe results indicated that living in urban areas, in contrast to rural areas, was a protective factor against anxiety experienced by the participants (OR = 0.810, 95% CI = 0.709 - 0.925). The stability of students' family income (OR = 0.726, 95% CI = 0.645 - 0.817) and living with parents (OR = 0.752, 95% CI = 0.596 - 0.950) were also protective factors against anxiety. However, having a relative or an acquaintance infected with COVID-19 was a risk factor for anxiety (OR = 3.007, 95% CI = 2.377 - 3.804).\nCorrelation between the COVID-19-related stressors (included economy and life affected, studies delayed) and levels of anxiety during the COVID-19 epidemic\nCorrelation analysis between the COVID-19-related stressors and college students' anxiety when facing the epidemic.\nTable 4	 	\nRelated stressors	Anxiety level	 		R	P	 	Worry about economic influences	0.327	&lt;0.001	 	Worry about academic delays	0.315	&lt;0.001	 	Influence on daily-life	0.316	&lt;0.001	 	Social support	-0.151	&lt;0.001	 	\nr Correlation coefficient.\nThe results of the correlation analysis are shown in Table 4 . Worry about the economic influences of the epidemic were positively related to the levels of anxiety in college students (r = 0.327, P &lt; .001). Moreover, worry about academic delays (r = 0.315, P &lt; .001) and the influence of the epidemic on daily-life (r = 0.316, P &lt; .001) were also moderately and positively correlated with the level of anxiety. In addition, the results suggested a negative association between social support and anxiety symptoms of college students during the COVID-19 outbreak. (r = -0.151, P &lt; .001).\nDiscussion\nStudies have suggested that public health emergencies can have many psychological effects on college students, which can be expressed as anxiety, fear, and worry, among others. The main goal of this study was to evaluate the psychological condition of college students during an epidemic and explore factors influencing their anxiety. This survey indicated that 24.9% of college students were afflicted with experienced anxiety because of the COVID-19 outbreak. Of these students, 0.9% experienced severe anxiety, and 21.3% experienced mild anxiety. College students' anxiety about COVID-19 might have been related to the effect of the virus on their studies (Cornine et al.,) and future employment. On the other hand, the students' anxiety may have been caused by the gradually increasing distances between people resulting from the quarantine. It is known if anxiety disorders are more likely to occur and worsen in the absence of interpersonal communication.\nIt has been indicated that the increasing number of patients and suspected cases, as well as the increasing number of provinces and countries affected by the outbreak, have elicited public worry about being infected in this outbreak, which has increased anxiety. Furthermore, the significant shortage of masks and disinfectants, the overwhelming and sensational news headlines, and erroneous news reports have also added to anxiety and fear. The results of this study indicated college students' anxiety regarding the epidemic was associated with their place of residence, source of parental income, whether living with parents and whether a relative or an acquaintance was infected with COVID-19. However, no significant difference in gender or region was indicated, which is different from previous findings. This difference indicates that male and female students experienced similar stresses and negative emotions as a result of the epidemic.\nMultivariate Logistic regression analysis suggested that living in urban areas, in contrast to rural areas, was conducive to reducing the anxiety of college students. This might be explained by the imbalance of economic, cultural, and educational resources between urban and rural areas. The urban economy is relatively prosperous and provides citizens with better material security. Similarly, the sanitary conditions in cities are better than in towns and villages, which decreases the chances of surviving the virus. Cities also have excellent educational resources, and they have made great efforts to publicize knowledge on how to prevent the epidemic, which attracts attention to the measures taken to stop the epidemic. The stability of family income was also was a significant factor in students' experienced anxiety during the COVID-19 crisis, which could be explained by increased psychological and economic pressure. Living with parents was another favorable factor against feeling anxious. Previous studies have indicated that the risk factors associated with emotional and anxiety disorders in adults include the death of parents in childhood, not living with parents, and parents' psychological problems and mental illnesses, which are consistent with the results of this study. Relatives or acquaintances being infected with COVID-19 was an independent risk factor in college students' anxiety about the epidemic, which might be related to the high contagiousness of the new coronavirus pneumonia.\nConsistent with our hypothesis, the COVID-19-related stressors, which include economic stressors, effects on daily-life, and academic delays, were positively associated with anxiety symptoms of Chinese college students during the epidemic. Similar studies have indicated that in addition to the national health situation, the epidemic will also have a significant impact on the economy of the country and individuals. Because of the outbreak, some families will lose their source of income, and students might feel anxious about paying their tuition fees. In China, the government took measures, including travel warnings and bans, and extending the national holidays to control the outbreak, which inevitably disrupted routine life and resulted in anxiety. In the mainland China and Hong Kong, all primary and secondary schools were closed, and universities were either postponing classes until March 2020 or were using distant/remote learning methods. These measures undoubtedly have a specific impact on the education and the growth of students. Finally, social support was negatively correlated with the anxiety of college students, which is consistent with previous findings. Social support not only reduces the psychological pressure during the epidemics but also changes the attitude regarding social support and help-seeking methods. This result suggests that effective and robust social support is necessary during public health emergencies.\nConclusions\nAbout 24.9% of college students have experienced anxiety because of this COVID-19 outbreak. Living in urban areas, living with parents, having a steady family income were protective factors for college students against experienced anxiety during the COVID-19 outbreak. However, having a relative or an acquaintance infected with COVID-19 was an independent risk factor for experienced anxiety. The COVID-19-related stressors that included economic stressors, effects on daily-life, and academic delays were positively associated with the level of anxiety symptoms of Chinese college students during the epidemic, whereas social support was negatively correlated with their anxiety.\nThe mental health of college students is significantly affected when faced with public health emergencies, and they require attention, help, and support of the society, families, and colleges. It is suggested that the government and schools should collaborate to resolve this problem in order to provide high-quality, timely crisis-oriented psychological services to college students.\nAuthors statement\nI solemnly declare: I abide by academic ethics, advocating rigorous style of study.

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were

patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension

abundantly immunolabeled for viral replicase subunits.\n However, double-stranded RNA, presumably revealing the site of viral RNA synthesis, mainly localized to the DMV interior.\n Since we could not discern a connection between DMV interior and cytosol, our analysis raises several questions about the mechanism of DMV formation and the actual site of SARS-CoV RNA synthesis.\n Our data document the extensive virus-induced reorganization of host cell membranes into a network that is used to organize viral replication and possibly hide replicating RNA from antiviral defense mechanisms.\n Together

less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7159299","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Chaolin","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yeming","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xingwang","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lili","surname":"Ren","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jianping","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Li","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guohui","surname":"Fan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiuyang","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoying","surname":"Gu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhenshun","surname":"Cheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiaan","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wenjuan","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuelei","surname":"Xie","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wen","surname":"Yin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Min","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yan","surname":"Xiao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Li","surname":"Guo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jungang","surname":"Xie","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guangfa","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rongmeng","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhancheng","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Jin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jianwei","surname":"Wang","email":"wangjw28@163.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Cao","email":"caobin_ben@163.com","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Global Network Report","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Technical Guide for Prevention and Control of New Coronavirus Infection in Medical Institutions (Second Edition) (2020-01-22)","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(03)14630-2","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Epidemiology and cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Guangdong, People's Republic of China, in February, 2003","abstract":"Background\nAn epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been associated with an outbreak of atypical pneumonia originating in Guangdong Province, People's Republic of China.\n\n We aimed to identify the causative agent in the Guangdong outbreak and describe the emergence and spread of the disease within the province.\n\n\nMethods\nWe analysed epidemiological information and collected serum and nasopharyngeal aspirates from patients with SARS in Guangdong in mid-February, 2003.

Wuhan, China, of Novel Coronavirus–Infected Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nThe initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7121484","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical

Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale","abstract":"Background\nGeneralized anxiety disorder has a strong impact on health-related quality of life.\n\n For this reason, it seems relevant to develop strategies allowing early diagnoses in order to promote appropriate treatments.\n\n The objective of this study was to culturally adapt and validate the GAD-7 for the Portuguese patients with generalized anxiety disorder.\n\n\nMethods\nFor the cultural adaptation of the Portuguese version of the GAD-7 scale we started with a previous translation made by Mapi Institute and decided to perform a clinical review followed by a cognitive debriefing with patients.\n\n Once piloted, this version was then tested in a larger sample for feasibility and reliability (1-week test-retest).\n\n Construct validity was assessed by the relationship between GAD-7 and socio-demographic and clinical variables.\n\n Its unidimensionality was tested by principal component factor analysis.\n\n Criterion validity was assessed by comparing GAD-7 scores with those obtained by HADS, and EQ-5D.\n\n STAI was mainly used as a screening indicator for patient inclusion.\n\n\nResults\nGAD-7 was considered feasible with a mean completion time of 2.3 minutes and no major floor or ceiling effects.\n\n We found an excellent Cronbach’s alpha internal consistency score (0.880) and the test-retest and interclass correlation coefficients were also very good.\n\n Regarding the construct validity, younger patients, those with higher education, employed and without anxiety symptoms revealed lower GAD-7 scores, meaning better health.\n\n The unidimensionality of GAD-7 index was also confirmed by principal component factor analysis.\n\n At last, GAD-7 was significantly correlated with other health outcome indices and the classification levels created by it and by HADS showed to be dependent.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe excellent metric properties confirmed the cultural adaptation and validity of GAD-7 into Portuguese population, allowing the clinicians an early detection and treatment of these patients.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4424548","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

carried out the cultural adaptation into Spanish of the 7-item self-administered GAD-7 scale, which is used to identify probable patients with GAD.\n\n\nMethods\nThe adaptation was performed by an expert panel using a conceptual equivalence process, including forward and backward translations in duplicate.\n\n Content validity was assessed by interrater agreement.\n\n Criteria validity was explored using ROC curve analysis, and sensitivity, specificity, predictive positive value and negative value for different cut-off values were determined.\n\n Concurrent validity was also explored using the HAM-A, HADS, and WHO-DAS-II scales.\n\n\nResults\nThe study sample consisted of 212 subjects (106 patients with GAD) with a mean age of 50.38 years (SD = 16.76).\n\n Average completion time was 2'30''.\n\n No items of the scale were left blank.\n\n Floor and ceiling effects were negligible.\n\n No patients with GAD had to be assisted to fill in the questionnaire.\n\n The scale was shown to be one-dimensional through factor analysis (explained variance = 72%).\n\n A cut-off point of 10 showed adequate values of sensitivity (86.8%) and specificity (93.4%), with AUC being statistically significant [AUC = 0.957-0.985); p &lt; 0.001].\n\n The scale significantly correlated with HAM-A (0.852, p &lt; 0.001), HADS (anxiety domain, 0.903, p &lt; 0.001), and WHO-DAS II (0.696, p &gt; 0.001).\n\n\nLimitations\nElderly people, particularly those very old, may need some help to complete the scale.\n\n\nConclusion\nAfter the cultural adaptation process, a Spanish version of the GAD-7 scale was obtained.\n\n The validity of its content and the relevance and adequacy of items in the Spanish cultural context were confirmed.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2831043","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

vaginal closure technique on early post-operative pain following vaginal prolapse surgery: a feasibility pilot study and qualitative assessment","abstract":"Background\nSurgery for pelvic organ prolapse is a common surgical procedure.\n\n There is little research studying post-operative pain, contrasting with extensive literature on pain after childbirth trauma which shows that suture method has a significant effect on pain.\n\n We designed a protocol for a trial comparing suture techniques and post-operative pain, and conducted a pre-protocol pilot to inform our trial design.\n\n\nMethods\nRoutine surgical data, post-operative pain scores (from 10 cm Visual Analogue Scales, VAS) and analgesic requirements were obtained from the notes of a cohort of women undergoing vaginal prolapse surgery.\n\n Median VAS scores at 4, 12 and 24 hours were compared by suture material used and method of closure (single continuous suture or interrupted sutures).\n\n The women whose data were obtained were invited to attend focus groups of up to six people in the twelve weeks following surgery.\n\n A semi structured question guide was used, and interviews were recorded, transcribed anonymously and analysed using the constant comparative method of grounded theory.\n\n Ethical approval was not sought because formal pre-protocol work is exempt for UK ethical requirements, but formal written consent on standard forms was obtained for publishing outcomes and anonymised comments from participants.\n\n\nResults\nComplete VAS data and operative details were available from 41 women.\n\n Surgery was completed using absorbable polyglactin sutures with continuous suturing (17 women) or interrupted sutures (24 women).\n\n Pain scores at 4 and 12 hours were similar; pain at 24 hours was greater in the women with interrupted sutures (median VAS 3 (range 0–8) versus 1.5 (0–8) (p?=?0.0513).\n\n Analgesic needs were similar.\n\n\nConclusions\nFormal pre-protocol work is informative; we found a moderate difference in our proposed outcomes, suggesting a trial was feasible but women themselves were unconvinced of the need for formal research into pain following vaginal surgery.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3887222","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Springer International

in 15 European countries showed that the AEs prevalence of AEDs in PWE was up to 80%.\n\n To date, there are no validated screening instruments to detect AEs of AEDs in Indonesian PWE.\n\n Therefore its epidemiology is currently unknown.\n\n This study aimed to validate the Indonesian version of Liverpool Adverse Events Profile (LAEP), consequently increasing physicians' awareness toward the probability of AEs and its necessary evaluation.\n\n Furthermore, this study was intended to determine the AEs prevalence of AEDs in Indonesian PWE.\n\n\n Methods\n The questionnaire was translated from English into Indonesian version.\n\n The validity and reliability were tested using Spearman correlation and Cronbach's alpha measurement.\n\n An observational cross-sectional study was carried out on consecutive PWE in outpatient clinic, Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital.\n\n We analyzed duration of epilepsy, onset of epilepsy, seizure frequency, type of epilepsy, etiology and epilepsy syndrome, number of AEDs, duration of AED use, and comorbidity.\n\n\n Results\n All of the 19 items in the questionnaire were valid, with correlation coefficient ranging from 0.465 to 0.690 (moderate-strong correlation).\n\n Cronbach's alpha value was 0.846 (good consistency).\n\n The total of 90 subjects were enrolled with 91% screened as having AEs using LAEP questionnaire.\n\n The most common AEs were tiredness (67.8%), sleepiness (66.7%), memory problems (62.2%), and difficulty in concentrating (56.7%).\n\n The only clinical variable that influenced AEs was polytherapy.\n\n\n Conclusion\n The Indonesian version of LAEP was a valid and reliable instrument to screen AE of AEDs in PWE.\n\n Almost all the subjects in this study were suspected having AEs.\n\n Polytherapy was the independent factor of AE.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6286758","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Hindawi","authors":[{"firstname":"Astri","surname":"Budikayanti","email":"astri.budikayanti@ui.ac.id","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lubna

We used data on monthly flight bookings from the Official Aviation Guide and data on human mobility across more than 300 prefecture-level cities in mainland China from the Tencent database.\n\n Data on confirmed cases were obtained from the reports published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n Serial interval estimates were based on previous studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV).\n\n A susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered metapopulation model was used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China.\n\n The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credibile interval (CrI).\n\n\nFindings\nIn our baseline scenario, we estimated that the basic reproductive number for 2019-nCoV was 2·68 (95% CrI 2·47–2·86) and that 75?815 individuals (95% CrI 37?304–130?330) have been infected in Wuhan as of Jan 25, 2020. The epidemic doubling time was 6·4 days (95% CrI 5·8–7·1).\n\n We estimated that in the baseline scenario, Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen had imported 461 (95% CrI 227–805), 113 (57–193), 98 (49–168), 111 (56–191), and 80 (40–139) infections from Wuhan, respectively.\n\n If the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV were similar everywhere domestically and over time, we inferred that epidemics are already growing exponentially in multiple major cities of China with a lag time behind the Wuhan outbreak of about 1–2 weeks.\n\n\nInterpretation\nGiven that 2019-nCoV is no longer contained within Wuhan, other major Chinese cities are probably sustaining localised outbreaks.\n\n Large cities overseas with close transport links to China could also become outbreak epicentres, unless substantial public health interventions at both the population and personal levels are implemented immediately.\n\n Independent self-sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally could become inevitable because of substantial exportation of presymptomatic cases and in the absence of large-scale public health interventions.\n\n Preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be readied for quick deployment globally.\n\n\nFunding\nHealth and Medical Research Fund (Hong Kong, China).\n\n\n","id":"PMC7159271","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Joseph T","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kathy","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gabriel M","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"  .

Africa Ebola outbreak confronted historically tenuous regional relationships of trust.\n Challenging sociopolitical contexts and initially inappropriate communication strategies impeded trustworthy relationships between communities and responders during the epidemic.\n Social scientists affiliated with the Ebola 100-Institut Pasteur project interviewed approximately 160 local, national and international responders holding a wide variety of roles during the epidemic.\n Focusing on responder’s experiences of communities’ trust during the epidemic, this qualitative study identifies and explores social techniques for effective emergency response.\n The response required individuals with diverse knowledges and experiences.\n Responders’ included on-the-ground social mobilisers, health workers and clinicians, government officials, ambulance drivers, contact tracers and many more.\n We find that trust was fostered through open, transparent and reflexive communication that was adaptive and accountable to community-led response efforts and to real-time priorities.\n We expand on these findings to identify ‘technologies of trust’ that can be used to promote actively legitimate trustworthy relationships.\n Responders engaged the social technologies of openness (a willingness and genuine effort to incorporate multiple perspectives), reflexivity (flexibly responsive to context and ongoing dialogue) and accountability (taking responsibility for local contexts and consequences) to facilitate relations of trust.\n Technologies of trust contribute to the development of a framework of practical techniques to improve the acceptance and effectiveness of future emergency response strategies","id":"PMC6407545","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BMJ

outbreak in Uganda","abstract":"Background\nThis paper documents and analyses some of the responses to the largest Ebola outbreak on record, which took place in Uganda between September 2000 and February 2001. Four hundred and twenty five people developed clinical symptoms in three geographically distinct parts of the country (Gulu, Masindi, and Mbarara), of whom 224 (53%) died.\n\n Given the focus of previous social scientific Ebola research on experiences in communities that have been directly affected, this article expands the lens to include responses to the outbreak in local, national, and international contexts over the course of the outbreak.\n\n\nMethods\nResponses to the outbreak were gauged through the articles, editorials, cartoons, and letters that were published in the country’s two main English language daily national newspapers: the New Vision and the Monitor (now the Daily Monitor).\n\n All the relevant pieces from these two sources over the course of the epidemic were cut out, entered onto a computer, and the originals filed.\n\n The three a priori codes, based on the local, national, and international levels, were expanded into six, to include issues that emerged inductively during analysis.\n\n The data within each code were subsequently worked into coherent, chronological narratives.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 639 cuttings were included in the analysis.\n\n Strong and varied responses to the outbreak were identified from across the globe.\n\n These included, among others: confusion, anger, and serious stigma in affected communities; medical staff working themselves to exhaustion, with some quitting their posts; patients fleeing from hospitals; calls on spiritual forces for protection against infection; a well-coordinated national control strategy; and the imposition of some international travel restrictions.\n\n Responses varied both quantitatively and qualitatively according to the level (i.\n\ne.\n\n local, national, or international) at which they were manifested.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe Ugandan experience of 2000/2001 demonstrates that responses to an Ebola outbreak can be very dramatic, but perhaps disproportionate to the actual danger presented.\n\n An important objective for any future outbreak control strategy must be to prevent excessive fear, which, it is expected, would reduce stigma and other negative outcomes.\n\n To this end, the value of openness in the provision of public information, and critically, of being seen to be open, cannot be overstated.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3477054","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"John","surname":"Kinsman","email":"john.kinsman@epiph.umu.se","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1177/1524839911405850","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Harnessing social media for health promotion and behaviour change","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Health organizations' use of social media tools during a pandemic situation: An H1N1 flu context","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Developing Tools for Strategic Communication to the Media on Emerging Infectious Diseases (EIDs)","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1080/10410236.2017.1405488","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Emergency Risk Communication: Lessons Learned from a Rapid Review of Recent Gray Literature on Ebola, Zika, and Yellow Fever","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.pubrev.2018.12.003","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Communicating about infectious disease threats: Insights from public health information officers","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A Literature Review on Effective Risk Communication for the Prevention and Control of Communicable Diseases in Europe Insights into Health Communication","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"From SARS to MERS, Thrusting Coronaviruses into the spotlight","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"10.1111/resp.13196","date":"2017-09-17","title":"MERS, SARS and other coronaviruses as causes of pneumonia","abstract":"Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been considered to be relatively harmless respiratory pathogens in the past.\n However, after the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and emergence of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), HCoVs have received worldwide attention as important pathogens in respiratory tract infection.\n This review focuses on the epidemiology, pathogenesis and clinical characteristics among SARS?coronaviruses (CoV), MERS?CoV and other HCoV infections.\n","id":"PMC7169239","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley &amp;

syndrome (MERS) is a new human disease caused by a novel coronavirus (CoV).\n\n Clinical data on MERS-CoV infections are scarce.\n\n We report epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of 47 cases of MERS-CoV infections, identify knowledge gaps, and define research priorities.\n\n\nMethods\nWe abstracted and analysed epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and laboratory data from confirmed cases of sporadic, household, community, and health-care-associated MERS-CoV infections reported from Saudi Arabia between Sept 1, 2012, and June 15, 2013. Cases were confirmed as having MERS-CoV by real-time RT-PCR.\n\n\nFindings\n47 individuals (46 adults, one child) with laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV disease were identified; 36 (77%) were male (male:female ratio 3·3:1).\n\n 28 patients died, a 60% case-fatality rate.\n\n The case-fatality rate rose with increasing age.\n\n Only two of the 47 cases were previously healthy; most patients (45 [96%]) had underlying comorbid medical disorders, including diabetes (32 [68%]), hypertension (16 [34%]), chronic cardiac disease (13 [28%]), and chronic renal disease (23 [49%]).\n\n Common symptoms at presentation were fever (46 [98%]), fever with chills or rigors (41 [87%]), cough (39 [83%]), shortness of breath (34 [72%]), and myalgia (15 [32%]).\n\n Gastrointestinal symptoms were also frequent, including diarrhoea (12 [26%]), vomiting (ten [21%]), and abdominal pain (eight [17%]).\n\n All patients had abnormal findings on chest radiography, ranging from subtle to extensive unilateral and bilateral abnormalities.\n\n Laboratory analyses showed raised concentrations of lactate dehydrogenase (23 [49%]) and aspartate aminotransferase (seven [15%]) and thrombocytopenia (17 [36%]) and lymphopenia (16 [34%]).\n\n\nInterpretation\nDisease caused by MERS-CoV presents with a wide range of clinical manifestations and is associated with substantial mortality in admitted patients who have medical comorbidities.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the epidemiology, community prevalence, and clinical spectrum of infection and disease need urgent definition.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7185445","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

SARS coronavirus targets the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, resulting in diffuse alveolar damage.\n Several organs/cell types may be infected in the course of the illness, including mucosal cells of the intestines, tubular epithelial cells of the kidneys, neurons of the brain, and several types of immune cells, and certain organs may suffer from indirect injury.\n Extensive studies have provided a basic understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease.\n In this review we describe the most significant pathological features of SARS, explore the etiological factors causing these pathological changes, and discuss the major pathogenetic mechanisms.\n The latter include dysregulation of cytokines/chemokines, deficiencies in the innate immune response, direct infection of immune cells, direct viral cytopathic effects, down-regulation of lung protective angiotensin converting enzyme 2, autoimmunity, and genetic factors.\n It seems that both abnormal immune responses and injury to immune cells may be key factors in the pathogenesis of this new disease.\n","id":"PMC1829448","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"American Society for Investigative

identified the major pathological changes in the respiratory and immune systems of patients who died of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) but gained little information on the organ distribution of SARS?associated coronavirus (SARS?CoV).\n In the present study, we used a murine monoclonal antibody specific for SARS?CoV nucleoprotein, and probes specific for a SARS?CoV RNA polymerase gene fragment, for immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, respectively, to detect SARS?CoV systematically in tissues from patients who died of SARS.\n SARS?CoV was found in lung, trachea/bronchus, stomach, small intestine, distal convoluted renal tubule, sweat gland, parathyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal gland, liver and cerebrum, but was not detected in oesophagus, spleen, lymph node, bone marrow, heart, aorta, cerebellum, thyroid, testis, ovary, uterus or muscle.\n These results suggest that, in addition to the respiratory system, the gastrointestinal tract and other organs with detectable SARS?CoV may also be targets of SARS?CoV infection.\n The pathological changes in these organs may be caused directly by the cytopathic effect mediated by local replication of the SARS?CoV; or indirectly as a result of systemic responses to respiratory failure or the harmful immune response induced by viral infection.\n In addition to viral spread through a respiratory route, SARS?CoV in the intestinal tract, kidney and sweat glands may be excreted via faeces, urine and sweat, thereby leading to virus transmission.\n This study provides important information for understanding the pathogenesis of SARS?CoV infection and sheds light on possible virus transmission pathways.\n This data will be useful for designing new strategies for prevention and treatment of SARS.\n Copyright ©

syndrome.\n\n\nBackground\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly emerged infection from a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV).\n\n Apart from fever and respiratory complications, acute renal impairment has been observed in some patients with SARS.\n\n Herein, we describe the clinical, pathologic, and laboratory features of the acute renal impairment complicating this new viral infection.\n\n\nMethods\nWe conducted a retrospective analysis of the plasma creatinine concentration and other clinical parameters of the 536 SARS patients with normal plasma creatinine at first clinical presentation, admitted to two regional hospitals following a major outbreak in Hong Kong in March 2003. Kidney tissues from seven other patients with postmortem examinations were studied by light microscopy and electron microscopy.\n\n\nResults\nAmong these 536 patients with SARS, 36 (6.7%) developed acute renal impairment occurring at a median duration of 20 days (range 5–48 days) after the onset of viral infection despite a normal plasma creatinine level at first clinical presentation.\n\n The acute renal impairment reflected the different prerenal and renal factors that exerted renal insult occurring in the context of multiorgan failure.\n\n Eventually, 33 SARS patients (91.7%) with acute renal impairment died.\n\n The mortality rate was significantly higher among patients with SARS and acute renal impairment compared with those with SARS and no renal impairment (91.7% vs.\n\n 8.8%) (P &lt; 0.0001).\n\n Renal tissues revealed predominantly acute tubular necrosis with no evidence of glomerular pathology.\n\n The adjusted relative risk of mortality associated with the development of acute renal impairment was 4.057 (P &lt; 0.001).\n\n By multivariate analysis, acute respiratory distress syndrome and age were the most significant independent risk factors predicting the development of acute renal impairment in SARS.\n\n\nConclusion\nAcute renal impairment is uncommon in SARS but carries a high mortality.\n\n The acute renal impairment is likely to be related to multi-organ failure rather than the kidney tropism of the virus.\n\n The development of acute renal impairment is an important negative prognostic indicator for survival with SARS.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7112337","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"International Society of Nephrology.

IgG1 Fc, as a model in the studies and found that a single amino acid substitution in the RBD (R441A) could abolish the immunogenicity of RBD to induce neutralizing antibodies in immunized mice and rabbits.\n With a panel of anti-RBD mAbs as probes, we observed that R441A substitution was able to disrupt the majority of neutralizing epitopes in the RBD, suggesting that this residue is critical for the antigenic structure responsible for inducing protective immune responses.\n We also demonstrated that the RBD-Fc bearing R441A mutation could not bind to soluble and cell-associated angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the functional receptor for SARS-CoV and failed to block S protein-mediated pseudovirus entry, indicating that this point mutation also disrupted the receptor-binding motif (RBM) in the RBD.\n Taken together, these data provide direct evidence to show that a single amino acid residue at key position in the RBD can determine the major function of SARS-CoV S protein and imply for designing SARS vaccines and therapeutics.\n","id":"PMC7092835","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002 was caused by a previously unknown coronavirus—SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV).\n\n We have developed an experimental SARS vaccine for direct immunisation of the respiratory tract, the major site of SARS-coronavirus transmission and disease.\n\n\nMethods\nWe expressed the complete SARS coronavirus envelope spike (S) protein from a recombinant attenuated parainfluenza virus (BHPIV3) that is being developed as a live attenuated, intranasal paediatric vaccine against human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3).\n\n We immunised eight African green monkeys, four with a single dose of BHPIV3/SARS-S and four with a control, BHPIV3/Ctrl, administered via the respiratory tract.\n\n A SARS-coronavirus challenge was given to all monkeys 28 days after immunisation.\n\n\nFindings\nImmunisation of animals with BHPIV3/SARS-S induced the production of SARS-coronavirus-neutralising serum antibodies, indicating that a systemic immune response resulted from mucosal immunisation.\n\n After challenge with SARS coronavirus, all monkeys in the control group shed SARS coronavirus, with shedding lasting 5–8 days.\n\n No viral shedding occurred in the

acute pneumonia, occasional renal failure, and a high mortality rate and is considered a threat to public health.\n The construction of a full-length infectious cDNA clone of the MERS-CoV genome in a bacterial artificial chromosome is reported here, providing a reverse genetics system to study the molecular biology of the virus and to develop attenuated viruses as vaccine candidates.\n Following transfection with the cDNA clone, infectious virus was rescued in both Vero A66 and Huh-7 cells.\n Recombinant MERS-CoVs (rMERS-CoVs) lacking the accessory genes 3, 4a, 4b, and 5 were successfully rescued from cDNA clones with these genes deleted.\n The mutant viruses presented growth kinetics similar to those of the wild-type virus, indicating that accessory genes were not essential for MERS-CoV replication in cell cultures.\n In contrast, an engineered mutant virus lacking the structural E protein (rMERS-CoV-?E) was not successfully rescued, since viral infectivity was lost at early passages.\n Interestingly, the rMERS-CoV-?E genome replicated after cDNA clone was transfected into cells.\n The infectious virus was rescued and propagated in cells expressing the E protein in trans, indicating that this virus was replication competent and propagation defective.\n Therefore, the rMERS-CoV-?E mutant virus is potentially a safe and promising vaccine candidate to prevent MERS-CoV

Efficacy in Senescent Mice Challenged with Recombinant SARS-CoV Bearing Epidemic and Zoonotic Spike Variants ","abstract":"Background\nIn 2003, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identified as the etiological agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome, a disease characterized by severe pneumonia that sometimes results in death.\n\n SARS-CoV is a zoonotic virus that crossed the species barrier, most likely originating from bats or from other species including civets, raccoon dogs, domestic cats, swine, and rodents.\n\n A SARS-CoV vaccine should confer long-term protection, especially in vulnerable senescent populations, against both the 2003 epidemic strains and zoonotic strains that may yet emerge from animal reservoirs.\n\n We report the comprehensive investigation of SARS vaccine efficacy in young and senescent mice following homologous and heterologous challenge.\n\n\nMethods and Findings\nUsing Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicon particles (VRP) expressing the 2003 epidemic Urbani SARS-CoV strain spike (S) glycoprotein (VRP-S) or the nucleocapsid (N) protein from the same strain (VRP-N), we demonstrate that VRP-S, but not VRP-N vaccines provide complete short- and long-term protection against homologous strain challenge in young and senescent mice.\n\n To test VRP vaccine efficacy against a heterologous SARS-CoV, we used phylogenetic analyses, synthetic biology, and reverse genetics to construct a chimeric virus (icGDO3-S) encoding a synthetic S glycoprotein gene of the most genetically divergent human strain, GDO3, which clusters among the zoonotic SARS-CoV.\n\n icGD03-S replicated efficiently in human airway epithelial cells and in the lungs of young and senescent mice, and was highly resistant to neutralization with antisera directed against the Urbani strain.\n\n Although VRP-S vaccines provided complete short-term protection against heterologous icGD03-S challenge in young mice, only limited protection was seen in vaccinated senescent animals.\n\n VRP-N vaccines not only failed to protect from homologous or heterologous challenge, but resulted in enhanced immunopathology with eosinophilic infiltrates within the lungs of SARS-CoV–challenged mice.\n\n VRP-N–induced pathology presented at day 4, peaked around day 7, and persisted through day 14, and was likely mediated by cellular immune responses.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis study identifies gaps and challenges in vaccine design for controlling future SARS-CoV zoonosis, especially in vulnerable elderly populations.\n\n The availability of a SARS-CoV virus bearing heterologous S glycoproteins provides a robust challenge inoculum for evaluating vaccine efficacy against zoonotic strains, the most likely source of future outbreaks.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1716185","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

evaluating a recombinant receptor-binding domain (rRBD) protein vaccine in a rhesus macaque model.\n\n\nMethods\nNine monkeys were randomly assigned to high-dose, low-dose and mock groups,which were immunized with different doses of rRBD plus alum adjuvant or adjuvant alone at different time points (0, 8, 25 weeks).\n\n Immunological analysis was conducted after each immunisation.\n\n Monkeys

had potent neutralizing activities against infection by pseudovirus expressing SARS-CoV S protein.\n Depletion of RBD-specific antibodies from patient or rabbit immune sera by immunoadsorption significantly reduced serum-mediated neutralizing activity, while affinity-purified anti-RBD antibodies had relatively higher potency neutralizing infectivity of SARS pseudovirus, indicating that the RBD of S protein is a critical neutralization determinant of SARS-CoV during viral infection and immunization.\n Two monoclonal antibodies (1A5 and 2C5) targeting at the RBD of S protein were isolated from mice immunized with inactivated SARS-CoV.\n Both 1A5 and 2C5 possessed potent neutralizing activities, although they directed against distinct conformation-dependant epitopes as shown by ELISA

and no research on the effectiveness of treatment options.\n\n The World Health Organization (WHO) expert panel on SARS treatment requested a systematic review and comprehensive summary of treatments used for SARS-infected patients in order to guide future treatment and identify priorities for research.\n\n\nMethods and Findings\nIn response to the WHO request we conducted a systematic review of the published literature on ribavirin, corticosteroids, lopinavir and ritonavir (LPV/r), type I interferon (IFN), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and SARS convalescent plasma from both in vitro studies and in SARS patients.\n\n We also searched for clinical trial evidence of treatment for acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n Sources of data were the literature databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) up to February 2005. Data from publications were extracted and evidence within studies was classified using predefined criteria.\n\n In total, 54 SARS treatment studies, 15 in vitro studies, and three acute respiratory distress syndrome studies met our inclusion criteria.\n\n Within in vitro studies, ribavirin, lopinavir, and type I IFN showed inhibition of SARS-CoV in tissue culture.\n\n In SARS-infected patient reports on ribavirin, 26 studies were classified as inconclusive, and four showed possible harm.\n\n Seven studies of convalescent plasma or IVIG, three of IFN type I, and two of LPV/r were inconclusive.\n\n In 29 studies of steroid use, 25 were inconclusive and four were classified as causing possible harm.\n\n\nConclusions\nDespite an extensive literature reporting on SARS treatments, it was not possible to determine whether treatments benefited patients during the SARS outbreak.\n\n Some may have been harmful.\n\n Clinical trials should be designed to validate a standard protocol for dosage and timing, and to accrue data in real time during future outbreaks to monitor specific adverse effects and help inform treatment.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1564166","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Lauren

Cell Response and Severe Disease in SARS-CoV-Infected Mice","abstract":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome caused substantial morbidity and mortality during the 2002–2003 epidemic.\n Many of the features of the human disease are duplicated in BALB/c mice infected with a mouse-adapted version of the virus (MA15), which develop respiratory disease with high morbidity and mortality.\n Here, we show that severe disease is correlated with slow kinetics of virus clearance and delayed activation and transit of respiratory dendritic cells (rDC) to the draining lymph nodes (DLN) with a consequent deficient virus-specific T cell response.\n All of these defects are corrected when mice are treated with liposomes containing clodronate, which deplete alveolar macrophages (AM).\n Inhibitory AMs are believed to prevent the development of immune responses to environmental antigens and allergic responses by interacting with lung dendritic cells and T cells.\n The inhibitory effects of AM can also be nullified if mice or AMs are pretreated with poly I:C, which directly activate AMs and rDCs through toll-like receptors 3 (TLR3).\n Further, adoptive transfer of activated but not resting bone marrow–derived dendritic cells (BMDC) protect mice from lethal MA15 infection.\n These results may be relevant for SARS in humans, which is also characterized by prolonged virus persistence and delayed development of a SARS-CoV-specific immune response in individuals with severe disease.\n","id":"PMC2762542","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

Is Required for Protection from Lethal Infection with a Mouse-Adapted SARS-CoV","abstract":"A novel human coronavirus, SARS-CoV, emerged suddenly in 2003, causing approximately 8000 human cases and more than 700 deaths worldwide.\n Since most animal models fail to faithfully recapitulate the clinical course of SARS-CoV in humans, the virus and host factors that mediate disease pathogenesis remain unclear.\n Recently, our laboratory and others developed a recombinant mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (rMA15) that was lethal in BALB/c mice.\n In contrast, intranasal infection of young 10-week-old C57BL/6 mice with rMA15 results in a nonlethal infection characterized by high titer replication within the lungs, lung inflammation, destruction of lung tissue, and loss of body weight, thus providing a useful model to identify host mediators of protection.\n Here, we report that mice deficient in MyD88 (MyD88?/?), an adapter protein that mediates Toll-like receptor (TLR), IL-1R, and IL-18R signaling, are far more susceptible to rMA15 infection.\n The genetic absence of MyD88 resulted in enhanced pulmonary pathology and greater than 90% mortality by day 6 post-infection.\n MyD88?/? mice had significantly higher viral loads in lung tissue throughout the course of infection.\n Despite increased viral loads, the expression of multiple proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines within lung tissue and recruitment of inflammatory monocytes/macrophages to the lung was severely impaired in MyD88?/? mice compared to wild-type mice.\n Furthermore, mice deficient in chemokine receptors that contribute to monocyte recruitment to the lung were more susceptible to rMA15-induced disease and exhibited severe lung pathology similar to that seen in MyD88?/?mice.\n These data suggest that MyD88-mediated innate immune signaling and inflammatory cell recruitment to the lung are required for protection from lethal rMA15 infection.\n","id":"PMC2587915","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

dissemination.\n It remains unknown, however, how severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) evades respiratory innate immunity to establish a systemic infection.\n Here we show in Chinese macaques that SARS-CoV traversed the mucosa through the respiratory tract within 2 days, resulting in extensive mucosal infiltration by T cells, MAC387+, and CD163+ monocytes/macrophages followed by limited viral replication in the lung but persistent viral shedding into the upper airway.\n Mucosal monocytes/macrophages sequestered virions in intracellular vesicles together with infected Langerhans cells and migrated into the tonsils and/or draining lymph nodes within 2 days.\n In lymphoid tissues, viral RNA and proteins were detected in infected monocytes upon differentiation into dendritic cells (DCs) within 3 days.\n Systemic viral dissemination was observed within 7 days.\n This study provides a comprehensive overview of the spatiotemporal interactions of SARS-CoV, monocytes/macrophages, and the DC network in mucosal tissues and highlights the fact that, while these innate cells contribute to viral clearance, they probably also serve as shelters and vehicles to provide a mechanism for the virus to escape host mucosal innate immunity and disseminate systemically.\n","id":"PMC4900951","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"© Society for

relevant parameters of SARS-CoV infection in NHPs, we infected cynomolgus macaques with SARS-CoV in three groups: Group I was infected in the nares and bronchus, group II in the nares and conjunctiva, and group III intravenously.\n\n Nonhuman primates in groups I and II developed mild to moderate symptomatic illness.\n\n All NHPs demonstrated evidence of viral replication and developed neutralizing antibodies.\n\n Chest radiographs from several animals in groups I and II revealed unifocal or multifocal pneumonia that peaked between days 8 and 10 postinfection.\n\n Clinical laboratory tests were not significantly changed.\n\n Overall, inoculation by a mucosal route produced more prominent disease than did intravenous inoculation.\n\n Half of the group I animals were infected with a

Since these changes do not interact with the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV, rh-ACE2 in general is as effective as human homolog in supporting viral entry.\n Rh-ACE2, however, is more polymorphic than hu-ACE2. Additional sporadic NS substitutions in clone Rh11-7 reduced the level of rh-ACE2 protein expression and did not support viral entry effectively.\n Further mutagenesis analysis showed that a natural mutation Y217N dramatically alters ACE2 expression and entry efficiency.\n Moreover, introduction of the Y217N mutation into hu-ACE2 caused the down-regulation of expression and reduced viral entry efficiency.\n These results indicate that the Y217N mutation plays a role in modulating SARS-CoV infection.\n Our results provide insights for understanding the role of rh-ACE2 in SARS lung pathogenesis in a non-human primate model.\n","id":"PMC7103406","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

major threat to public health1–3.\n Despite intense research efforts, how, when and where new diseases appear are still a source of considerable uncertainty.\n A severe respiratory disease was recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China5.\n This outbreak highlights the ongoing ability of viral spill-over from animals to cause severe disease in humans.\n","id":"PMC7094943","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing Group UK","authors":[{"firstname":"Fan","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Su","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yan-Mei","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wen","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhi-Gang","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Wu","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Wu","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jun-Hua","surname":"Tian","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yuan-Yuan","surname":"Pei","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ming-Li","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yu-Ling","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Fa-Hui","surname":"Dai","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qi-Min","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jiao-Jiao","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lin","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Edward C.","surname":"Holmes","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yong-Zhen","surname":"Zhang","email":"zhangyongzhen@shphc.org.cn","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Yong-Zhen","surname":"Zhang","email":"zhangyongzhen@shphc.org.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1038/s41586-020-2012-7","date":"2020-01-29","title":"A pneumonia outbreak associated with a new coronavirus of probable bat origin","abstract":"id='Par1'>Since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 18 years ago, a large number of SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoVs) have been discovered in their natural reservoir host, bats1–4.\n Previous studies have shown that some bat SARSr-CoVs have the potential to infect humans5–7.\n Here we report the identification and characterization of a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which caused an epidemic of acute respiratory syndrome in humans in Wuhan, China.\n The epidemic, which started on 12 December 2019, had caused 2,794 laboratory-confirmed infections including 80 deaths by 26 January 2020. Full-length genome sequences were obtained from five patients at an early stage of the outbreak.\n The sequences are almost identical and share 79.6% sequence identity to SARS-CoV.\n Furthermore, we show that 2019-nCoV is 96% identical at the whole-genome level to a bat coronavirus.\n Pairwise protein sequence analysis of seven conserved non-structural proteins domains show that this virus belongs to the species of SARSr-CoV.\n In addition, 2019-nCoV virus isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of a critically ill patient could be neutralized by sera from several patients.\n

Coronavirus–Infected Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nThe initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7121484","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission,

We assess the prevalence of mental health problems and examine their association with social media exposure. A cross-sectional study among Chinese citizens aged&gt;=18 years old was conducted during Jan 31 to Feb 2, 2020. Online survey was used to do rapid assessment. Total of 4872 participants from 31 provinces and autonomous regions were involved in the current study. Besides demographics and social media exposure (SME), depression was assessed by The Chinese version of WHO-Five Well-Being Index (WHO-5) and anxiety was assessed by Chinese version of generalized anxiety disorder scale (GAD-7). multivariable logistic regressions were used to identify associations between social media exposure with mental health problems after controlling for covariates. The prevalence of depression, anxiety and combination of depression and anxiety (CDA) was 48.3% (95%CI: 46.9%-49.7%), 22.6% (95%CI: 21.4%-23.8%) and 19.4% (95%CI: 18.3%-20.6%) during COVID-19 outbroke in Wuhan, China.

Our findings show there are high prevalence of mental health problems, which positively associated with frequently SME during the COVID-19 outbreak. These findings implicated the government need pay more attention to mental health problems, especially depression and anxiety among general population and combating with &quot;infodemic&quot; while combating during public health emergency.\nIntroduction\nA public health emergency of international concern-novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbroke in Wuhan, China on 31 December 2019, which has been spread to 24 countries outside of China and infected 37,558 patients globally (37,251 in China) by 9 February 2020. The outbreak of COVID-19 in China has caused mental health problems among the public in China and Japan and medical workers in Wuhan. The National Health Commission has released guideline for local authorities to promote psychological crisis intervention for patients, medical personnel, people under medical observation and civilians during the COVID-19 outbreak. However, what type of mental disorders are prevalent and how they distribute among population are not know. So, a rapid assessment of outbreak-associated mental disorders for both civilians and health care workers, is needed.\nThe official departments strive to improve the public's awareness of prevention and intervention strategies by providing daily updates about surveillance and active cases on websites and social media. Besides, many self-media and netizens also release and transfer related information on social media, such as WeChat and Weibo. Social media may lead to (mis)information overload, which in turn may cause mental health problems. WHO pointed out that identifying the underlying drivers of fear, anxiety and stigma that fuel misinformation and rumour, particularly through social media. Previous studies indicated that indirect exposure to mass trauma through the media can increase the initial rates of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. A previous study also shown social media exposure may positively related to forming risk perceptions during the MERS outbreak in South Korea. But there was no study to examine the association between social media exposure and mental health problems. So, the current study aims to describes the prevalence and distribution of two major mental disorders-anxiety and depression among Chinese population, and examine their associations with social media exposure by rapid assessment during COVID-19 outbreak.\nMaterials and methods\nDesign and participants\nThis cross-sectional study was online conducted during Jan 31 to Feb 2, 2020. Chinese citizens aged&gt;=18 years old were invited to participate online survey though Wenjuanxing platform(https://www.wjx.cn/app/survey.aspx). In total, 5,851 participants took part in the survey. After removing the participants without completed questionnaires, 4872 participants from 31 provinces and autonomous regions were involved in the current study. A written consent in the first section of online survey was given to all participants before filling the questionnaire. This study has been approved by the Institutional Review Board of Fudan University, School of Public Health(IRB#2020-01-0800).\nMeasurements\nMental health problems\nAccording to a previous study two major mental disorders-depression and anxiety were assessed in the current study. Depression was assessed by The Chinese version of WHO-Five Well-Being Index (WHO-5), which consists of five positively worded items that reflect the presence or absence of well-being rather than depressive symptomatology. Participants are asked to report the presence of these positive feelings in the last 2 weeks on a 6-point scale ranging from all of the time (5 points) to at no time (0 points). A summed score below 13 indicates depression. Anxiety was assessed by Chinese version of generalized anxiety disorder scale (GAD-7), which consists 7 symptoms. Participants were asked how often they were bothered by each symptom during the last 2 weeks. Response options were &quot;not at all,&quot; &quot;several days,&quot; &quot;more than half the days,&quot; and &quot;nearly every day,&quot; scored as 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively. A score of 10 or greater represents a reasonable cut point for identifying cases of anxiety(S1 Table).\nSocial media exposure (SME)\nSocial media exposure was measured by asking how often respondents during the past week were exposed to news and information about COVID-19 on social media, such as Sina weibo, Zhihu, Douban, WeChat and etc (S1 Table). Response options were &quot;never&quot;, &quot;once in a while&quot;, &quot;sometimes&quot;, &quot;often&quot; and &quot;very often&quot;. Because of less proportion of &quot;never&quot;, so we recoded social media exposure into &quot;less&quot; (&quot;never&quot; and &quot;once in a while&quot;), &quot;sometimes&quot; and &quot;frequently&quot; (&quot;often&quot; and &quot;very often&quot;).\nCovariates\nThe following covariates were included in this study: gender, age (10-year categories), educational level (junior high school, senior high school, college and master and higher), marital status (recoded into married and other [including unmarried, divorced, and widowed]), self-rated health (categorized as excellent, very good and good or low), occupation(students/retired, health care worker and others), cities(Wuhan and others), area(urban and rural).\nStatistical analyses\nThe chi2 /trend tests were used to determine the prevalence of depression, anxiety and combination of depression and anxiety by categorical variables including social media exposure and covariates. Logistic regression analyses were used to explain the association between the prevalence of depression, anxiety and combination of depression and anxiety and SME after controlling for covariates. We estimated the adjusted ORs and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of independent variables for frailty. The STATA version 13.0 program (StataCorp LP., College Station, TX, USA) was used to carry out all analyses.\nResults\nSocial media exposure\nOf all 4827 participants, the mean age of was 32.3+-10.0 years (ranged 18-85), the proportion of &quot;less&quot;, &quot;sometimes&quot;, and &quot;frequently&quot; of SME was 8.8%(95%CI:8.0%-9.6%), 9.2%(95%CI:8.4%-10.0%) and 82.0%(95%CI:80.9%-83.1%). As shown in Table 1, more than 60% of them (67.7%) were women, and most (47.9%) were aged 21-30 years. Many participants (62.2%) had achieved a college education, more than half of them were married. Only 5.2% of them were health care workers and 2.7% were from Hubei province, and 81.2% were from urban area. Most of them reported &quot;excellent&quot; (43.9%) or &quot;very good&quot; (45.6%) health.\nUnivariate analyses found that the proportion of frequently SME among men (78.4%, 95%CI: 76.3%-80.3%) was lower than among women (83.8%, 95%CI: 82.4%-85.0%), the proportion of frequently SME among youngers (aged -30 years) was higher than among elders (aged 41- years). Participants with low education (middle school and high school) had lower proportion of frequently SME than who with high education (college and master). Participants who are students or retired had higher proportion of frequently SME. The proportion of SME was not different between participants from Hubei province and others, however, participants from rural area reported higher proportion of frequently SME than who from urban area. Participants who were excellent health had higher proportion of frequently SME than others.\nParticipants characteristic and social media exposure.\n	N(%)	Social media exposure	P value	 	Less	Sometimes	Frequently	 	Overall	4827(100)	424(8.8:8.0-9.6)	444(9.2:8.4-10.0)	3959(82.0:80.9-83.1)		 	Gender						 	Male	1560(32.3)	161(10.3:8.9-11.9)	176(11.3:9.8-13.0)	1223(78.4:76.3-80.3)	&lt;0.001	 	Female	3267(67.7)	263(8.1:7.2-9.0)	268(8.2:7.3-9.2)	2736(83.8:82.4-85.0)	 	Age(years)						 	-20	256(5.3)	11(4.3:2.2-7.6)	14(5.5:3.0-9.0)	231(90.2:85.9-93.6)	&lt;0.001	 	21-30	2312(47.9)	120(5.2:4.3-6.2)	150(6.5:5.5-7.6)	2042(88.3:86.9-89.6)	 	31-40	1288(26.9)	124(9.6:8.1-11.4)	144(11.2:9.5-13.0)	1020(79.2:76.9-81.4)	 	41-50	749(15.5)	120(16.0:13.5-18.8)	109(14.6:12.1-17.3)	520(69.4:66.0-72.7)	 	51-	222(4.6)	49(22.1:16.8-28.1)	27(12.2:8.2-17.2)	146(65.8:59.1-72.0)	 	Education						 	Middle school	257(5.3)	45(17.5:13.1-22.7)	30(11.7:8.0-16.2)	182(70.8:64.8-76.3)	&lt;0.001	 	High School	782(16.2)	85(10.9:8.8-13.3)	96(12.3:10.1-14.8)	601(76.9:73.7-79.8)	 	College	3002(62.2)	224(7.5:6.5-8.5)	256(8.5:7.6-9.6)	2522(84.0:82.6-85.3)	 	Master	786(16.3)	70(8.9:7.0-11.1)	62(7.9:6.1-10.0)	654(83.2:80.4-85.8)	 	Marriage						 	Married	2607(54.0)	314(12.0:10.8-13.5)	306(11.7:10.5-13.0)	1987(76.2:74.5-77.8)	&lt;0.001	 	No married	2220(46.0)	110(5.0:4.1-5.9)	138(6.2:5.2-7.3)	1972(88.8:87.4-90.1)	 	Occupation						 	Students/retired	1189(24.6)	84(7.1:5.7-8.7)	70(5.9:4.7-7.4)	1035(87.1:85.0-88.9)	&lt;0.001	 	Health care workers	251(5.2)	25(10.0:6.5-14.4)	23(9.2:5.9-13.4)	203(80.9:75.5-85.6)	 	others	3387(70.2)	315(9.3:8.3-10.3)	351(10.4:9.4-11.4)	2721(80.3:79.0-81.7)	 	Cities						 	Hubei	130(2.7)	7(5.4:2.2-10.8)	13(10.0:5.4-16.5)	110(84.6:77.2-90.3)	0.375	 	Others	4697(97.3)	417(8.9:8.1-9.7)	431(9.2:8.4-10.0)	3849(82.0:80.8-83.0)	 	Area						 	Urban	3920(81.2)	363(9.3:8.4-10.2)	371(9.5:8.6-10.4)	3186(81.3:80.0-82.5)	0.015	 	Rural	907(18.8)	61(6.7:5.2-8.6)	73(8.1:6.4-10.0)	773(85.2:82.7-87.5)	 	Self-rate health						 	Excellent	2118(43.9)	173(8.2:7.0-9.4)	179(8.5:7.3-9.7)	1766(83.4:81.7-84.9)	0.020	 	Very good	2202(45.6)	191(8.7:7.5-9.9)	209(9.5:8.3-10.8)	1802(81.8:80.2-83.4)	 	Good/general/poor	507(10.5)	60(11.8:9.1-15.0)	56(11.1:8.5-14.1)	391(77.2:73.2-80.7)	 	\nDepression and SME\nThe prevalence of depression was 48.3% (95%CI: 46.9%-49.7%). As shown Fig 1, Multivariate analyses found that the adjusted odds of depression were greater among who age 21-30 years (OR = 1.49, 95%CI: 1.12-1.99) and 31-40 years (OR = 1.54, 95%CI: 1.11-2.14) compared with who aged &lt;=20 years, and lower among those with college (OR = 0.69, 95%CI: 0.53-0.91) and master (OR = 0.46, 95%CI: 0.63-0.85) education than those with middle school. Participants from Hubei province had no higher adjusted odds than those from other province (OR = 1.06, 95%CI: 0.75-1.52), but those from rural area had lower adjusted odds (OR = 0.74, 95%CI: 0.64-0.87) than those from urban area. The decrease of self-rated health significantly accompanied the increased odds of depression. About the focus of this study, higher frequency of SME was insignificantly positively associated with the adjusted odds of depression after controlling for all covariates.\nPrevalence of depression and relevant factors.\nAnxiety and SME\nThe prevalence of anxiety was 22.6% (95%CI: 21.4%-23.8%). As shown Fig 2, Multivariate analyses found that that the adjusted odds of depression were greater among those aged 31-40 years (OR = 1.63, 95%CI: 1.06-2.51) compared with those aged -20 years, and lower among those with college (OR = 0.40, 95%CI: 0.30-0.53) and master (OR = 0.31, 95%CI: 0.22-0.44) education than those with middle school. The adjusted odds of depression among unmarried participants (OR = 0.80, 95%CI: 0.66-0.96) was lower than among married ones. Participants from other provinces had no higher adjusted odds (OR = 0.49, 95%CI: 0.33-0.71) than those from Hubei province. The adjusted odds of depression were greater among those with good/general/poor SRH (OR = 1.77, 95%CI: 1.41-2.21) compared with those with excellent SRH. About the focus of this study, frequently SME can increase the adjusted odds (OR = 1.72, 95%CI: 1.31-2.26) of anxiety compared with less SME after controlling for all covariates.\nPrevalence of anxiety and relevant factors.\nCombination of depression and anxiety and SME\nThe prevalence of combination of depression and anxiety (CDA) was 19.4% (95%CI: 18.3%-20.6%). As shown Fig 3, Multivariate analyses found that that the adjusted odds of depression were greater among those aged 31-40 years (OR = 1.69, 95%CI: 1.07-2.68) compared with those aged -20 years, and lower among those with college (OR = 0.50, 95%CI: 0.37-0.68) and master (OR = 0.40, 95%CI: 0.28-0.57) education than those with middle school. The adjusted odds of depression among unmarried participants (OR = 0.79, 95%CI: 0.64-0.97) was lower than among married ones. The adjusted odds of depression were greater among those with good/general/poor SRH (OR = 1.77, 95%CI: 1.41-2.21) compared with those with excellent SRH. About the focus of this study, frequently SME can increase the adjusted odds (OR = 1.91, 95%CI: 1.52-2.41) of CDA compared with less SEM after controlling for all covariates.\nPrevalence of combination of depression and anxiety and relevant factors.\nDiscussion\nThe latest national sample indicated the prevalence of any disorder (excluding dementia), anxiety disorders and depressive disorders was 16.6% (95%CI: 13.0-20.2), 7.6% (95%CI: 6.3-8.8) and 6.9% (95%CI: 6.6-7.2) in China. Comparing with this national data, the current cross-sectional study found that much higher prevalence of depression (48.3%, 95%CI: 46.9%-49.7%), anxiety (22.6%, 95%CI: 21.4%-23.8%) and CDA (19.4%, 95%CI: 18.3%-20.6%) during COVID-19 outbroke in Wuhan, China. These findings are consistent with the previous studies' that exposing public health emergency can cause public mental health problems, such as Wenchuan and Lushan earthquakes, 2014 Ebola Outbreak, and SARS.\nSocial media is one of main channels updating the COVID-19 information. This study also found that 82.0% of participants frequently expose them to social media, and frequently SME associated high odds of anxiety and CDA, which is consistent with previous studies. there may be two reasons explaining the association between frequently SME and mental health. During COVID-19 outbreak, disinformation and false reports about the COVID-19 have bombarded social media and stoked unfounded fears among many netizens, which may confuse people and harm people's mental health. Besides, many citizens expressed their negative feelings, such as fear, worry, nervous, anxiety et al. on social media, which are contagious social network. So, WHO's 'infodemics' team is working hand in glove with countries' communications department to deliver information to a broader public audience. Finally, we also found that SME was not different between participants from Hubei province and others, but the formers faced higher odds of anxiety. It indicated that participants from Hubei province- the infectious focus directly expose to public health emergency, and may suffer more mental health problemes. Compared with the control measures taken by other cities, Wuhan have sealed off the city from all outside contact to stop the spread of the COVID-19. As the prevention and control measures called new standard by WHO, the lockdown of Wuhan is a very effective way to interrupt the transmission of the virus, however, the strictest measures in Wuhan might lead to more serious mental health problems of local people.\nSome potential limitations should be noted in this study. First, this is a cross-sectional study, so it is difficult to accurately elucidate causal relationships between SME and mental health. Additional longitudinal studies, such as cohort studies or nested case-control studies, are essential in the future. Although large sample, the survey was conducted online, which is suitable for rapid assessment, so some respondent bias, such as few elder citizens' participation, may have affected the results. Finally, although we did control for many covariates, we cannot exclude the possibility of some residual confounding caused by unmeasured factors.\nConclusions\nIn conclusion, our findings show there are high prevalence of mental health problems, which positively associated with frequently SME during the COVID-19 outbreak. These findings implicated the government need pay more attention to mental health among general population while combating with COVID-19. Fortunately, The China government have provided mental health services by varied channel including hotline, online consultation, online course and outpatient consultation, but more attention should be paid to depression and anxiety. The next implication is to combat with &quot;infodemic&quot; by monitoring and filtering out false information and promoting accurate information though cross-section collaborations.\nSupporting information\nReferences\nWHO.

(Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)\nReviewer #1: 1 In the result sections &quot;Anxiety and SME&quot; and &quot;Combination of depression and Anxiety and SME&quot;, the author also used the keyword &quot;depression&quot;.\n2 The authors revealed the positive relationship between SME and anxiety, however, the value of this finding has not been described clearly and the advice for application is not rational. Because of the lack of causal evidence, we cannot know whether the higher SME is the reason or the result of higher anxiety. There seems no convincing reason to leave both the general suggestion of combating with &quot;infodemic&quot;, as well as the specific suggestions against false information and rumors, since there is no data at all in this article to distinguish the influence from true or false social media information on those cases with anxiety.\nIf the authors could provide more data on WHY frequent SME associated with high odds of anxiety and CDA, their implications about infodemic would be more reasonable.\nReviewer #2: The authors investigated the relationship between social media exposure and the prevalence of mental health problems during a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in Wuhan, China. They found that there are high prevalence of\nmental health problems, which positively associated with frequently social media exposure during this infectious outbreak.\nThe subject of this manuscript is important and interesting in the present world situation, and the findings may be helpful for the design of future infectious disease outbreak management. I recommend this for the publication in this journal.\n**********\n6. PLOS authors have the option to publish the peer review history of their article (what does this mean?).

Because of the lack of causal evidence, we cannot know whether the higher SME is the reason or the result of higher anxiety. There seems no convincing reason to leave both the general suggestion of combating with &quot;infodemic&quot;, as well as the specific suggestions against false information and rumors, since there is no data at all in this article to distinguish the influence from true or false social media information on those cases with anxiety.\nIf the authors could provide more data on WHY frequent SME associated with high odds of anxiety and CDA, their implications about infodemic would be more reasonable.\nResponse: thank you for your crucial suggestion. Because this is a cross-sectional study, we can elucidate causal relationships between SME and mental health, which has been mentioned in the limitation section.\nBased on literature, we think there may be two reasons as following\n During COVID-19 outbreak, disinformation and false reports about the COVID-19 have bombarded social media and stoked unfounded fears among many netizens[20], which may confuse people and harm people's mental health[9]. This study found that frequently SME associated high odds of anxiety and CDA, which is consistent with previous studies.11 Besides, many citizens expressed their negative feelings, such as fear, worry, nervous, anxiety et al. on social media, which are contagious social network[21,22].\nAs for this limitation, we revised the implications in order to make them consisting with results according to your suggestions.\nReviewer #2: The authors investigated the relationship between social media exposure and the prevalence of mental health problems during a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in Wuhan, China. They found that there are high prevalence of\nmental health problems, which positively associated with frequently social media exposure during this infectious outbreak.\nThe subject of this manuscript is important and interesting in the present world situation, and the findings may be helpful for the design of future infectious disease outbreak management. I recommend this for the publication in this journal.\nResponse: thank you for your comments.\n10.1371/journal.pone.0231924.r003\nDecision Letter 1\nHashimoto\nKenji\nThis is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.\n 6 Apr 2020 \nMental health problems and social media exposure during COVID-19 outbreak\nPONE-D-20-06332R1\nDear Dr. Gao,\nWe are pleased to inform you that your manuscript has been judged scientifically suitable for publication and will be formally accepted for publication once it complies with all outstanding technical requirements.\nWithin one week, you will receive an e-mail containing information on the amendments required prior to publication.

Cases exported domestically were then estimated.\n\n We forecasted the national and global spread of 2019-nCoV, accounting for the effect of the metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan and surrounding cities, which began Jan 23–24, 2020. We used data on monthly flight bookings from the Official Aviation Guide and data on human mobility across more than 300 prefecture-level cities in mainland China from the Tencent database.\n\n Data on confirmed cases were obtained from the reports published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n Serial interval estimates were based on previous studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV).\n\n A susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered metapopulation model was used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China.\n\n The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credibile interval (CrI).\n\n\nFindings\nIn our baseline scenario, we estimated that the basic reproductive number for 2019-nCoV was 2·68 (95% CrI 2·47–2·86) and that 75?815 individuals (95% CrI 37?304–130?330) have been infected in Wuhan as of Jan 25, 2020. The epidemic doubling time was 6·4 days (95% CrI 5·8–7·1).\n\n We estimated that in the baseline scenario, Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen had imported 461 (95% CrI 227–805), 113 (57–193), 98 (49–168), 111 (56–191), and 80 (40–139) infections from Wuhan, respectively.\n\n If the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV were similar everywhere domestically and over time, we inferred that epidemics are already growing exponentially in multiple major cities of China with a lag time behind the Wuhan outbreak of about 1–2 weeks.\n\n\nInterpretation\nGiven that 2019-nCoV is no longer contained within Wuhan, other major Chinese cities are probably sustaining localised outbreaks.\n\n Large cities overseas with close transport links to China could also become outbreak epicentres, unless substantial public health interventions at both the population and personal levels are implemented immediately.\n\n Independent self-sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally could become inevitable because of substantial exportation of presymptomatic cases and in the absence of large-scale public health interventions.\n\n Preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be readied for quick deployment globally.\n\n\nFunding\nHealth and Medical Research Fund (Hong Kong, China).\n\n\n","id":"PMC7159271","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Joseph T","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kathy","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gabriel M","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"  .

Stigma: Lessons Learned from HIV/AIDS","abstract":"Background\nHIV/AIDS and Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) are contemporary epidemics associated with significant social stigma in which communities affected suffer from social rejection, violence, and diminished quality of life.\n\n\nObjective\nTo compare and contrast stigma related to HIV/AIDS and EVD, and strategically think how lessons learned from HIV stigma can be applied to the current EVD epidemic.\n\n\nMethods\nTo identify relevant articles about HIV/AIDS and EVD-related stigma, we conducted an extensive literature review using multiple search engines.\n\n PubMed was used to search for relevant peer-reviewed journal articles and Google for online sources.\n\n We also consulted the websites of the World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the National Institutes of Health to retrieve up-to-date information about EVD and HIV/AIDS.\n\n\nResults\nMany stigmatizing attitudes and behaviors directed towards those with EVD are strikingly similar to those with HIV/AIDS but there are significant differences worthy of discussion.\n\n Both diseases are life-threatening and there is no medical cure.\n\n Additionally misinformation about affected groups and modes of transmission runs rampant.\n\n Unlike in persons with EVD, historically criminalized and marginalized populations carry a disproportionately higher risk for HIV infection.\n\n Moreover, mortality due to EVD occurs within a shorter time span as compared to HIV/AIDS.\n\n\nConclusions\nStigma disrupts quality of life, whether it is associated with HIV infection or EVD.\n\n When addressing EVD, we must think beyond the immediate clinical therapeutic response, to possible HIV implications of serum treatment.\n\n There are emerging social concerns of stigma associated with EVD infection and double stigma associated with EVD and HIV infection.\n\n Drawing upon lessons learned from HIV, we must work to empower and mobilize prominent members of the community, those who recovered from the disease, and organizations working at the grassroots level to disseminate clear and accurate information about EVD transmission and prevention while promoting stigma reduction in the process.\n\n In the long run, education, prevention, and a therapeutic vaccine will be the optimal solutions for reducing the stigma associated with both EVD and HIV.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4225220","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Co-Action

outbreak will be the last.\n\n This study aimed to evaluate the long-term psychiatric morbidities in survivors of SARS.\n\n\nMethod\nThis is a cohort study designed to investigate psychiatric complications among SARS survivors treated in the United Christian Hospital 30 months after the SARS outbreak.\n\n Psychiatric morbidities were assessed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, the Impact of Events Scale–Revised and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.\n\n Functional outcomes were assessed by the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey.\n\n\nResults\nNinety subjects were recruited, yielding a response rate of 96.8%.\n\n Post-SARS cumulative incidence of DSM-IV psychiatric disorders was 58.9%.\n\n Current prevalence for any psychiatric disorder at 30 months post-SARS was 33.3%.\n\n One-fourth of the patients had post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and 15.6% had depressive disorders.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe outbreak of SARS can be regarded as a mental health catastrophe.\n\n PTSD was the most prevalent long-term psychiatric condition, followed by depressive disorders.\n\n Our results highlight the need to enhance preparedness and competence of health care professionals in detecting and managing the psychological sequelae of future comparable infectious disease outbreaks.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7112501","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Inc.","authors":[{"firstname":"Ivan Wing
