patients with coronavirus disease 2019 in New York: retrospective case series\nAbstract\nObjective\nTo characterize patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) in a large New York City medical center and describe their clinical course across the emergency department, hospital wards, and intensive care units.\nDesign\nRetrospective manual medical record review.\nSetting\nNewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center, a quaternary care academic medical center in New York City.\nParticipants\nThe first 1000 consecutive patients with a positive result on the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) who presented to the emergency department or were admitted to hospital between 1 March and 5 April 2020. Patient data were manually abstracted from electronic medical records.\nMain outcome measures\nCharacterization of patients, including demographics, presenting symptoms, comorbidities on presentation, hospital course, time to intubation, complications, mortality, and disposition.\nResults\nOf the first 1000 patients, 150 presented to the emergency department, 614 were admitted to hospital (not intensive care units), and 236 were admitted or transferred to intensive care units. The most common presenting symptoms were cough (732/1000), fever (728/1000), and dyspnea (631/1000). Patients in hospital, particularly those treated in intensive care units, often had baseline comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. Patients admitted to intensive care units were older, predominantly male (158/236, 66.9%), and had long lengths of stay (median 23 days, interquartile range 12-32 days); 78.0% (184/236) developed acute kidney injury and 35.2% (83/236) needed dialysis. Only 4.4% (6/136) of patients who required mechanical ventilation were first intubated more than 14 days after symptom onset. Time to intubation from symptom onset had a bimodal distribution, with modes at three to four days, and at nine days. As of 30 April, 90 patients remained in hospital and 211 had died in hospital.\nConclusions\nPatients admitted to hospital with covid-19 at this medical center faced major morbidity and mortality, with high rates of acute kidney injury and inpatient dialysis, prolonged intubations, and a bimodal distribution of time to intubation from symptom onset.\nIntroduction\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is a global pandemic and New York City is an epicenter of the disease. Since the first patient was confirmed to have covid-19 on 1 March 2020, there were 164 505 laboratory confirmed cases across the city, resulting in 42 417 hospital admissions and 13 000 confirmed deaths (as of 30 April). Internationally, the rapid spread of covid-19 has taxed hospital system resources, resulting in a shortage of ventilators and other medical equipment in many countries. Within New York City, the high burden of disease quickly exceeded the standard capacity of hospital systems. Massive expansion of inpatient and intensive care unit facilities was required, which raised concerns about optimal clinical management, safe maximization of hospital throughput, and resource allocation.  \nDespite the pressing need for evidence to inform such key decisions, data remain limited on covid-19 in the United States, and comparisons with data from previously published international cohorts are lacking. Patient characteristics, illness course, practice patterns, resource utilization, morbidity, and mortality associated with covid-19 have been considered in only limited samples.     The US effort at characterizing this disease began with two small case series from Seattle, while internationally, Wuhan, China   and Lombardy, Italy have published more extensively about their experiences. Characteristics of patients from New York City are beginning to be enumerated with limited data on patients admitted to hospital, including the critically ill. However, much remains unknown about how these patients compare with previously described US and international cohorts and what implications these differences will have on clinical care, outcomes, and resources.  \nTherefore, we sought to characterize the course of the first 1000 consecutive adult patients with covid-19 treated at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center (NYP/CUIMC), a large quaternary care academic medical center. We provide a detailed description of demographic data, comorbidities, presenting symptoms, clinical course including time to intubation, hospital complications, patient outcomes, and mortality. Box 1 provides the overall clinical context driving care throughout the first months of the pandemic's spread in New York City.\nCriteria for coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) testing and treatment \nTesting policies:\nEarly March:recommended testing only patients with symptoms in hospital.\nMid March:updated to include patients showing symptoms and who needed to be admitted to hospital, were at high risk, or were being discharged to congregate settings.\nEarly April:expanded to all patients being admitted to hospital.\nDiagnosis:\nA covid-19 diagnosis was defined as a positive result on the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.\nHospital admission:\nMost common criterion for admission to hospital was room air hypoxemia.\nIntensive care unit admission:\nUsually reserved for patients with acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation.\nIntubation:\nStarted for patients with hypoxemia on a non-rebreather face mask or high flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy (SpO2 88-92%) or substantial increased work of breathing, altered mental status, or arterial hypotension.\nSelf-proning was encouraged for patients requiring a non-rebreather face mask or high flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy who were alert and able to self-prone.\nExtubation:\nExtubation was sought for patients who:\nhad improving, mild hypoxemia (SpO2&gt;90% with FiO2&lt;=40%)\npassed a spontaneous breathing trial using pressure support ventilation\nwere hemodynamically stable\nhad a Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale score of at least -2.\nMethods\nData source and study sample\nWe used data from the NYP/CUIMC electronic health record and NYP clinical data warehouse to identify patients with laboratory confirmed covid-19 infection, as represented by a positive result on the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). NYP/CUIMC Clinical Microbiology Laboratory began in-house testing on 11 March, with earlier tests sent out to the New York Department of Health, and the latest initial positive test for this cohort was on 6 April. Patients in this cohort with positive Department of Health tests all had repeat positive tests at NYP/CUIMC. This aligned with patients who initially presented between 1 March and 5 April 2020. We performed ongoing retrospective manual data abstraction from the electronic health records of all patients with covid-19 who received emergency department or inpatient care at NYP/CUIMC (excluding tests performed in the outpatient setting or at another hospital). We characterized the first 1000 consecutive patients with covid-19.\nNYP/CUIMC is a quaternary care academic medical center with 765 adult beds serving a diverse, high acuity patient population in the Manhattan borough of New York City. NYP/CUIMC includes Milstein Hospital, which has six intensive care units, and Milstein Heart Center, which has an additional coronary and cardiothoracic intensive care unit, making a total of 117 adult intensive care unit beds. As patient volume increased, a further 160 surge intensive care unit beds were created to expand capacity in multiple locations throughout the hospital. The non-ICU general medicine bed capacity was expanded from 216 to 540. With the increase in capacity and resources, all necessary treatments and interventions remained available to patients throughout the study period. For the purpose of this paper, an intensive care unit bed is defined as one with the capability of providing mechanical ventilation and continuous vital sign monitoring, with staffing by critical care nurses and oversight by intensivists. The most common criterion for hospital admission for covid-19 patients was room air hypoxemia. Intensive care unit admissions were most commonly reserved for patients with acute respiratory failure that required mechanical ventilation.\nManual chart review\nAn abstraction team of 30 trained medical students from the Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons who were supervised by multiple clinicians and informaticians manually abstracted data from electronic health records in chronological order by test date. Information from the charts was inputted directly into REDCap (research electronic data capture) by using an instrument previously designed and validated by the abstraction team at Weill Cornell Medicine, who identified a mean Cohen's kappa for categorical variables of 0.92 (interquartile range 0.86-0.97) and 0.94 (0.87-0.97) for continuous variables. The REDCap instrument collects 274 data fields, 90 of which are required. Our abstraction team was trained in multiple hour long sessions by the Weill Cornell team and instrument developers. Calibration of the data collection across both sites was achieved through biweekly meetings and use of remote communication platforms. Records with missing data or with inconsistent times were reviewed by a second, dedicated quality control abstractor. A random subsample of abstracted data was checked by a second abstractor, typically a clinician, for calibration and consistency. Any conflicting data were resolved by consensus.\nData collected were demographics, comorbidities, presenting symptoms, laboratory and radiographical findings, hospital course including admission, intensive care unit transfer, mechanical ventilation, complications (defined as those documented by clinicians in the electronic health record) such as acute respiratory distress syndrome or acute kidney injury, and disposition including discharge, transfer, or death. Supplemental table 1 lists the definitions used for specified complications. Time of first symptom was recorded based on the patient's history; if patients did not or could not give a specific date of their first symptom, it was recorded that they could only give an approximate time. Data that were not present in the electronic health record were excluded from analysis; no imputation was performed. Laboratory test data and race or ethnicity data were extracted from the clinical data warehouse.\nData characterization and analysis\nIndividual records were labeled with the highest level of care a patient received as of 30 April: emergency department only, in hospital (not intensive care units), and admission to intensive care units. This paper covers patients still in hospital, those who have been discharged, and patients who died in the hospital. For patients with multiple covid-19 related visits recorded on the electronic health record, the visit with the highest level of care was selected. For patients with multiple visits with the same level of care, the most recent visit was selected. Characteristics were stratified by the highest level of care received to date, and 95% confidence intervals were recorded for each value. A multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis was performed to predict death, intubation, and a composite of either death or intubation.\nAll analyses and visualizations were performed using R. Continuous variables were reported as medians and interquartile ranges. Relevant time differences were computed from documented dates and times on the electronic health record. Hartigan's dip test was used to test for multimodality. \nPatient and public involvement statement\nGiven the urgency and rapid progression of the covid-19 pandemic, there was a need to disseminate information quickly and thus patients were not directly involved in the development, implementation, or interpretation of this research study. Furthermore, this study was based on chart reviews, which were not accessible to non-medical or non-research personnel, limiting patient and public involvement.\nResults\nBetween 11 March and 6 April, a total of 2423 patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2 at NYP/CUIMC, with 1403 patients testing positive and 1020 negative (supplemental table 2). Of the patients with a positive test, 1132 received emergency department or hospital care. Our cohort includes the first 1000 of these consecutive patients. This sample consisted of 150 patients treated in the emergency department, 614 patients admitted to hospital who did not require intensive care, and 236 patients admitted to intensive care units; 90 patients remained in hospital as of 30 April.\nBaseline characteristics\n Table 1 presents a detailed breakdown of baseline characteristics, including demographics, comorbidities, and home drug treatments. The median age was 63.0 years (interquartile range 50.0-75.0). A male predominance was found in the overall sample (596/1000), which was more pronounced among patients in intensive care units (158/236, 66.9% male). The median body mass index for all patients was 28.6 (interquartile range 25.2-33.1) and 29.4 (25.7-34.2) for patients in intensive care units. Hypertension was the most common comorbidity, present in 601 of 1000 patients, followed by diabetes in 372 of 1000 (table 1). Only 82 of 1000 patients reported no major comorbidities. The most common home drug treatments were statins (361/1000) and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (284/1000).\nBaseline characteristics of patients who tested positive for coronavirus disease 2019 stratified by highest level of care.* Data are reported as frequencies (number) and column percentages (%;

Of the 1000 patients, 910 patients reached a primary endpoint as of 30 April: 699 patients had been discharged, 211 had died in the hospital, and 90 were still in hospital. Of the 150 patients treated in the emergency department, 128 (85.3%) were discharged and 22 (14.7%) died before admission; 86 of the 614 patients (14.0%) treated in hospital (not intensive care units) died. Of 236 patients treated in intensive care units, 220 (93.2%) were intubated at least once, 74 (31.4%) were extubated at least once, and 46 (19.5%) were discharged; 103 (43.6%) died in the hospital and 87 (36.9%) remain in hospital. Most patients in intensive care units (174/236, 73.7%) required supplemental oxygen within three hours of arriving at the emergency department and received a nasal cannula (143/236, 60.6%) or a non-rebreather face mask (174/236, 73.7%). Less than 10% received high flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy (19/236) or non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (7/236) during their stay in hospital (supplemental table 4). In our multivariate Cox models, age, body mass index, and pre-existing HIV or renal disease were statistically significantly associated with death, while sex and hypertension were associated with intubation and the composite outcome of intubation or death (supplemental table 5).\nInpatient characteristics, drug treatments, and complications of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 stratified by highest level of care received during their hospital stay.

Ninety patients have not reached the end of their hospital stay and their charts continue to be reviewed. For inpatient drug treatments and complications, overall column includes patients in hospital only (n=850). These are the outcomes reviewed as of 30 April 2020.\nMedian length of stay is calculated as days from admission to either discharge, death, or last chart review.\nOverall, 64.9% (552/850) of patients in hospital received over 48 hours of antibiotic treatment during their stay (most commonly azithromycin) and 63.9% (543/850) received hydroxychloroquine (table 3). Both treatments were more prevalent in patients in intensive care units, with 94.9% (224/236) on antibiotics and 89.8% (212/236) on hydroxychloroquine; 94.1% (222/236) of patients in intensive care units received vasopressors at some point during their hospital stay.\nAcross all patients in hospital with covid-19, 33.9% (288/850) developed acute kidney injury and 13.8% (117/850) required inpatient dialysis (table 3). In intensive care units, acute kidney injury and dialysis were even more common at 78.0% (184/236) and 35.2% (83/236), respectively. Acute respiratory distress syndrome was diagnosed in 35.2% (299/850) of all patients in hospital and in 89.8% (212/850) of patients in intensive care units.\nTime course of patients who were intubated\nThe time from the first reported symptoms to initial intubation (for the 136 patients who were intubated and had exact date of first symptom recorded) appears bimodal (P=0.004 for multimodality), with modes at three to four days and at nine days after symptom onset (fig 1). For patients who had exact date of first symptom recorded and ultimately required mechanical ventilation, 95.6% (130/136) were first intubated within 14 days after symptom onset. Additionally, 71.6% (161/225) were intubated within the first three days after arrival at the emergency department (supplemental fig 1).\nDistribution of time from first symptom to intubation for 136 patients who had exact date of first symptom recorded. The time from first symptom to first intubation follows a bimodal distribution (P=0.004 for Hartigan's dip test), with modes at three to four days and at nine days\nOf patients who were intubated, 32.2% (75/233) were extubated at least once, 47.6% (111/233) died in hospital, 15.5% (36/233) were discharged from hospital, and 36.9% (86/233) were still in hospital at the time of reporting. Figure 2 shows the hospital timeline for each patient who was intubated (exact time of intubation recorded), starting from presentation at the emergency department, and stratified by clinical status (death, discharge, or still in hospital). Median time of invasive mechanical ventilation (for first intubation) was 6.0 days (interquartile range 2.0-13.0) in patients who died, 9.0 (6.5-12.0) in those who were discharged, and 28.5 (22.25-31.75) in patients who were still in hospital.\nTimeline of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 who were intubated.

ED=emergency department; IQR=interquartile range\nDiscussion\nPrincipal findings\nIn our characterization of the first 1000 consecutive patients with covid-19 who received care in the emergency department or in hospital at NYP/CUIMC, we found a bimodal distribution for time to intubation from symptom onset. Our cohort had high rates of baseline comorbidities and a substantial proportion developed acute kidney injury, required inpatient dialysis, had prolonged intubation time and length of stay. Through manually abstracted data, this retrospective study provides an in-depth description of patients with covid-19 at a more granular level than previous literature. We found a bimodal distribution for time to intubation, which could suggest a biphasic nature to the covid-19 disease process. We hope a better understanding of our patient population, baseline characteristics, hospital course, and clinical outcomes can provide valuable guidance to clinicians who are working in a time of unparalleled volume and uncertainty.\nComparison with other studies\nWe found higher rates of renal complications in our patient sample compared with previous research. Studies from China reported 15% of all patients with covid-19 developed acute kidney injury, while a case series in Seattle found 19.1% developed this condition. However, we found 33.9% of all patients with covid-19 and 78.0% of patients in intensive care units developed acute kidney injury, a striking increase compared with previous reports. Concomitantly, 13.8% of all patients and 35.2% of patients in intensive care units required inpatient dialysis, leading to a shortage of equipment needed for dialysis and continuous renal replacement therapy. Similar experiences with slightly lower rates of acute kidney injury and continuous renal replacement therapy have been reported in other hospitals in New York City, resulting in the shared allocation of dialysis machines across patients, including those in intensive care units. Several explanations can be suggested for these higher rates of renal complications. When treating patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, providers often limit use of intravenous fluids, and this lung protective fluid management strategy might have incidentally led to higher rates of acute kidney injury. Alternatively, there might be inherent renal toxicity associated with the pathophysiology of covid-19 given that the rates of acute kidney injury are high even in patients not receiving intensive care or in those without acute respiratory distress syndrome. These rates might also be relatively higher than previous studies because of the high acuity and increased comorbidities of our patient population.\nOur patients had a higher average body mass index, greater prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, and chronic pulmonary disease than those characterized in Italian and Chinese cohorts   ; however fewer patients had no major comorbidity (8.2% v 32% and 52%, respectively). During the study period, New York City encouraged patients with mild symptoms to stay at home, and NYP/CUIMC implemented triaging practices (including cough, cold, and fever clinics, initial evaluation in tents outside the emergency department, and telemedicine follow-up) to manage patients without severe dyspnea at home. Therefore, the patients who tested positive at NYP/CUIMC probably represented a higher acuity subset of patients with symptoms. However, patients with covid-19 in this sample have so far had similar mortality rates to patients in the epicenters of other countries. Across all levels of care, 21.1% of patients died, which is similar to other mortality rates in the New York region (18.5-21%),  and lies between estimates from China (1.4-28%).   In our sample, the mortality rate of patients in intensive care units is 43.6%, while previous reports have suggested highly variable mortality rates in Italy (26%), China (38% and 78%), and Seattle (50% and 67%).     However, because 36.9% of patients treated in intensive care units are still in hospital, the mortality will probably continue to rise.\nImplications for clinical practice\nThe characterizations of prolonged intubation time and a bimodal distribution in time to intubation from symptom onset could help clinicians identify when patients are at high risk and anticipate disease progression. Of the 233 patients intubated at least once, 95.6% were intubated within the first 14 days of symptom onset, with bimodal peaks at three to four days and at nine days after symptom onset. Patients often undergo rapid respiratory decompensation, which leads to increased clinician uncertainty. These findings might encourage plans for continued monitoring and vigilance despite clinical stability or improvement if patients are between the peaks at three to four days, and at nine days. However, providers could be reassured to de-escalate or discharge when patients are on a stable or improving trajectory after 14 days of symptoms, thereby optimizing hospital beds and resource utilization. This pattern might be because of the underlying pathophysiology, different response groups, or phenotypes of patients who develop critical illness at different times or changing practice patterns. However, supplemental figure 2 shows that this distribution has not clearly varied over the course of this study, which suggests that practice patterns over time are less likely to be the primary factor behind this finding. In previous reports from China, patients tended to develop acute respiratory distress syndrome around day 12. Another paper from Italy hypothesized that older patients with covid-19 tend to develop dyspnea five to seven days after symptom onset, whereas younger patients tend to develop dyspnea later. Further work is necessary to understand the mechanisms driving this distribution of intubation times because it could dictate the timing of interventions and treatments.\nLength of stay and total time on mechanical ventilation remain high for patients with covid-19, with major implications for post recovery needs and sequelae. To date, our total cohort had a median length of stay of six days, which increased to 23 days for patients in intensive care units. The overall length of stay was comparable to two cohorts in China, with median length of stay of 11 and 12 days, respectively.  However, length of stay for our patients in intensive care units is considerably longer than that for one of the Chinese studies, which reports a length of study of only eight days. In addition, our median length of stay will continue to rise given that 36.9% of patients in intensive care units were still in hospital at last review. Median time on mechanical ventilation for our patients who are still in hospital was over 28 days and rising, which dramatically exceeds the total length of hospital stay for most patients in China. While the overall hospital course is comparable to previous influenza cohorts, the length of stay of patients who are critically ill exceeds those of patients with influenza who have reported median intubation durations of 10-12 days.  Understanding and anticipating this prolonged intubation course might help provide guidance on resource utilization and hospital capacity. Aftercare planning for patients after discharge from intensive care units will also be critically important. Lengthy intubations and hospital admissions have profound implications for rehabilitation, critical illness neuropathy, discharge planning, physical therapy,   increased home needs during a time of social distancing, and potential difficulties in returning to baseline functional status.\nAs the covid-19 pandemic progresses, the characterization of these patients and outcomes might be more representative of the evolving clinical presentation and course that hospitals around the world could expect to see. These results might help guide the development of patient protocols (such as safe discharge guidelines and follow-up practices), inform emergency medical system responses, and drive the continued growth of telemedicine and remote monitoring. While an understanding of our experience might be helpful to hospitals and healthcare workers as they prepare to triage patients, we recognize that patients with covid-19 who require hospital admission will have high morbidity and mortality rates, and a substantial proportion will require beds in intensive care units, ventilators, or dialysis. These sobering facts should motivate efforts to further investigate a potential biphasic disease course suggested by the distribution of intubations, model the resource needs across hospitals and countries based on these rising rates of complications, and continue to develop interventions to change the course of the disease.\nLimitations of this study\nThis study has several limitations. Firstly, data collection is limited to what is documented in the electronic health records. Errors could exist in both patient recall and clinician documentation. Secondly, accuracy of data is limited by the accuracy of the data abstraction itself. We attempt to mitigate potential errors with manual quality control and by implementing a series of checks in the data after export from the REDCap database. Thirdly, not all patients included in this study have completed their hospital admission and might have evolving outcomes or levels of care, although we now have a minimum follow-up of 24 days. Data were collected from a single, urban academic medical center and might not be generalizable to all other regions. Finally, multivariate modeling on this population might be limited by residual confounding and bias. However, the urgency for data to inform clinicians has motivated us to provide this snapshot of patients at the point of last data abstraction on 30 April 2020. We deliberately focused on characterizing the data in this paper to provide descriptive statistics and figures rather than hypothesis driven statistical inference.\nConclusion\nOur study found that patients in hospital with covid-19 in New York City had high rates of baseline comorbidities and a substantial proportion developed complications compared with previously studied US and international cohorts. These patients faced major morbidity and mortality, with high rates of acute kidney injury and inpatient dialysis, prolonged intubations, and a bimodal distribution of time to intubation from symptom onset. Our characterization of patients could provide anticipatory guidance as the pandemic continues around the world.\nWhat is already known on this topic\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is a global pandemic, with New York City a new epicenter of the disease\nThe high burden of disease has quickly exceeded the standard capacity of hospital systems and has raised concerns about optimal clinical management, safe maximization of hospital throughput, and resource allocation\nFrontline healthcare providers have limited data to help anticipate the clinical course of these patients and how they compare with previous international cohorts\nWhat this study adds\nPatients with covid-19 who required mechanical ventilation had a bimodal distribution in time to intubation from symptom onset, with most first intubated within 14 days\nPatients in hospital, particularly those in intensive care units, had more comorbidities, longer intubations, and higher rates of acute kidney injury and inpatient dialysis than previous international cohorts\nThese findings might help inform frontline providers and provide anticipatory guidance for the international community during this pandemic\nExtra material supplied by authors\nContributors: MGA, SLB, CLS, and JRT contributed equally and share first authorship.

Scarce resources allocation in the COVID-19 outbreak","abstract":"After initially emerging in China, the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak has advanced rapidly.\n The World Health Organization (WHO) has recently declared it a pandemic, with Europe becoming its new epicentre.\n Italy has so far been the most severely hit European country and demand for critical care in the northern region currently exceeds its supply.\n This raises significant ethical concerns, among which is the allocation of scarce resources.\n Professionals are considering the prioritisation of patients most likely to survive over those with remote chances, and this news has triggered an intense debate about the right of every individual to access healthcare.\n The proposed analysis suggests that the national emergency framework in which prioritisation criteria are currently enforced should not lead us to perceive scarce resources allocation as something new.\n From an ethical perspective, the novelty of the current emergency is not grounded in the devastating effects of scarce resources allocation, which is rife in recent and present clinical practice.\n Rather, it has to do with the extraordinarily high number of people who find themselves personally affected by the implications of scarce resources allocation and who suddenly realise that the principle of equals should be treated equally may no longer be applicable.\n Along with the need to allocate appropriate additional financial resources to support the healthcare system, and thus to mitigate the scarcity of resources, the analysis insists on the relevance of a medical ethics perspective that does not place the burden of care and choice solely on physicians.\n","id":"PMC7242866","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BMJ Publishing Group","authors":[{"firstname":"Chiara","surname":"Mannelli","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMp2005689","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The toughest triage:allocating ventilators in a pandemic","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1001/jama.2020.5046","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A framework for rationing ventilators and critical care beds during the COVID-19 pandemic","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1136/medethics-2020-106332","date":"2020-04-20","title":"Who gets the ventilator?

China","abstract":"Background\nSince December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and

hospitalized cohort with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19.\nMethods\nPatients with COVID-19 admitted to 1 of 5 Mount Sinai Health System hospitals in New York City between February 27, 2020, and April 12, 2020, with troponin-I (normal value&lt;0.03ng/ml) measured within 24h of admission were included (n=2,736).\n\n Demographics, medical histories, admission laboratory results, and outcomes were

diffuse alveolar damage with severe capillary congestion and variegated findings in lungs and other organs suggesting vascular dysfunction","abstract":"Aims\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID?19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS?CoV?2), has rapidly evolved into a sweeping pandemic.\n\n Its major manifestation is in the respiratory tract, and the general extent of organ involvement and the microscopic changes in the lungs remain insufficiently characterised.\n\n Autopsies are essential to elucidate COVID?19?associated organ alterations.\n\n\nMethods and results\nThis article reports the autopsy findings of 21 COVID?19 patients hospitalised at the University Hospital Basel and at the Cantonal Hospital Baselland, Switzerland.\n\n An in?corpore technique was performed to ensure optimal staff safety.\n\n The primary cause of death was respiratory failure with exudative diffuse alveolar damage and massive capillary congestion, often accompanied by microthrombi despite anticoagulation.\n\n Ten cases showed superimposed bronchopneumonia.\n\n Further findings included pulmonary embolism (n=4), alveolar haemorrhage (n=3), and vasculitis (n=1).\n\n Pathologies in other organ systems were predominantly attributable to shock; three patients showed signs of generalised and five of pulmonary thrombotic microangiopathy.\n\n Six patients were diagnosed with senile cardiac amyloidosis upon autopsy.\n\n Most patients suffered from one or more comorbidities (hypertension, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes mellitus).\n\n Additionally, there was an overall predominance of males and individuals with blood group A (81% and 65%, respectively).\n\n All relevant histological slides are linked as open?source scans in supplementary files.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis study provides an overview of postmortem findings in COVID?19 cases, implying that hypertensive, elderly, obese, male individuals with severe cardiovascular comorbidities as well as those with blood group A may have a lower threshold of tolerance for COVID?19. This provides a pathophysiological explanation for higher mortality rates among these patients.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7496150","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley and Sons

49.2%).\n\n An atypical presentation including at least one among mental confusion, diarrhoea or nausea and vomiting was observed in 53/317 patients (16.7%).\n\n Hypokalaemia occurred in 25.8% (78/302) and 18.5% (56/303) had acute kidney injury.\n\n During hospitalization, 111/317 patients (35.0%) received non-invasive respiratory support, 65/317 (20.5%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and 60/317 (18.5%) required invasive mechanical ventilation.\n\n All-cause in-hospital mortality, assessed in 275 patients, was 43.6% (120/275).\n\n On multivariable analysis, age (per-year increase OR 1.07; 95% CI 1.041.10; p&lt;0.001), cardiovascular disease (OR 2.58; 95% CI 1.076.25; p 0.03), and C-reactive protein levels (per-point increase OR 1.009; 95% CI 1.0041.014; p 0.001) were independent risk factors for all-cause in-hospital mortality.\n\n\nConclusions\nCOVID-19 mainly affected elderly patients with predisposing conditions and caused severe illness, frequently requiring non-invasive respiratory support or ICU admission.\n\n Despite supportive care, COVID-19 remains associated with a substantial risk of all-cause in-hospital mortality.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7428680","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases.

analysis","abstract":"Background\nIn the face of rapidly changing data, a range of case fatality ratio estimates for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been produced that differ substantially in magnitude.\n\n We aimed to provide robust estimates, accounting for censoring and ascertainment biases.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected individual-case data for patients who died from COVID-19 in Hubei, mainland China (reported by national and provincial health commissions to Feb 8, 2020), and for cases outside of mainland China (from government or ministry of health websites and media reports for 37 countries, as well as Hong Kong and Macau, until Feb 25, 2020).\n\n These individual-case data were used to estimate the time between onset of symptoms and outcome (death or discharge from hospital).\n\n We next obtained age-stratified estimates of the case fatality ratio by relating the aggregate distribution of cases to the observed cumulative deaths in China, assuming a constant attack rate by age and adjusting for demography and age-based and location-based under-ascertainment.\n\n We also estimated the case fatality ratio from individual line-list data on 1334 cases identified outside of mainland China.\n\n Using data on the prevalence of PCR-confirmed cases in international residents repatriated from China, we obtained age-stratified estimates of the infection fatality ratio.\n\n Furthermore, data on age-stratified severity in a subset of 3665 cases from China were used to estimate the proportion of infected individuals who are likely to require hospitalisation.\n\n\nFindings\nUsing data on 24 deaths that occurred in mainland China and 165 recoveries outside of China, we estimated the mean duration from onset of symptoms to death to be 178 days (95% credible interval [CrI] 169192) and to hospital discharge to be 247 days (229281).\n\n In all laboratory confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases from mainland China (n=70?117), we estimated a crude case fatality ratio (adjusted for censoring) of 367% (95% CrI 356380).\n\n However, after further adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment, we obtained a best estimate of the case fatality ratio in China of 138% (123153), with substantially higher ratios in older age groups (032% [027038] in those aged &lt;60 years vs 64% [5772] in those aged ?60 years), up to 134% (112159) in those aged 80 years or older.\n\n Estimates of case fatality ratio from international cases stratified by age were consistent with those from China (parametric estimate 14% [0435] in those aged &lt;60 years [n=360] and 45% [18111] in those aged ?60 years [n=151]).\n\n Our estimated overall infection fatality ratio for China was 066% (039133), with an increasing profile with age.\n\n Similarly, estimates of the proportion of infected individuals likely to be hospitalised increased with age up to a maximum of 184% (110376) in those aged 80 years or older.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThese early

of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 490 years (IQR 410580).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 80 days [IQR 50130]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest

2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in

associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 3666 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 36 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 610 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship

died by Jan 31, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.\n\n\nFindings\n191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital.\n\n 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients).\n\n Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 110, 95% CI 103117, per year increase; p=00043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (565, 2611223; p&lt;00001), and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL (1842, 26412855; p=00033) on admission.\n\n Median duration of viral shedding was 200 days (IQR 170240) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors.\n\n The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage.\n\n Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.\n\n\nFunding\nChinese Academy of Medical Sciences Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences; National Science Grant for Distinguished Young Scholars; National Key Research and Development Program of China; The Beijing Science and Technology Project; and Major Projects of National Science and Technology on New Drug Creation and Development.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7270627","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Fei","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ronghui","surname":"Du","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Guohui","surname":"Fan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Zhibo","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Jie","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"5"},{"firstname":"Yeming","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Xiaoying","surname":"Gu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lulu","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xudong","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Jiuyang","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shengjin","surname":"Tu","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Hua","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Cao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"10.1001/jama.2020.1097","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The novel coronavirus originating in Wuhan, China: challenges for global health governance","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1101/2020.02.07.937862","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus: the species and its viruses:a statement of the Coronavirus Study Group","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Short term outcome and risk factors for adverse clinical outcomes in adults with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2001316","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Early Transmission Dynamics in Wuhan, China, of Novel CoronavirusInfected Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nThe initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020.

SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 597 (SD 133) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (615%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 311) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (646 years [112] vs 519 years [129]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (135%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 12 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and

Data on the epidemiology, clinical course, and outcomes of critically ill patients with COVID-19 in this setting are needed.\n\n\nMethods\nThis prospective observational cohort study took place at two NewYork-Presbyterian hospitals affiliated with Columbia University Irving Medical Center in northern Manhattan.\n\n We prospectively identified adult patients (aged ?18 years) admitted to both hospitals from March 2 to April 1, 2020, who were diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and were critically ill with acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure, and collected clinical, biomarker, and treatment data.\n\n The primary outcome was the rate of in-hospital death.\n\n Secondary outcomes included frequency and duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, frequency of vasopressor use and renal replacement therapy, and time to in-hospital clinical deterioration following admission.\n\n The relation between clinical risk factors, biomarkers, and in-hospital mortality was modelled using Cox proportional hazards regression.\n\n Follow-up time was right-censored on April 28, 2020 so that each patient had at least 28 days of observation.\n\n\nFindings\nBetween March 2 and April 1, 2020, 1150 adults were admitted to both hospitals with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, of which 257 (22%) were critically ill.\n\n The median age of patients was 62 years (IQR 5172), 171 (67%) were men.\n\n 212 (82%) patients had at least one chronic illness, the most common of which were hypertension (162 [63%]) and diabetes (92 [36%]).\n\n 119 (46%) patients had obesity.\n\n As of April 28, 2020, 101 (39%) patients had died and 94 (37%) remained hospitalised.\n\n 203 (79%) patients received invasive mechanical ventilation for a median of 18 days (IQR 928), 170 (66%) of 257 patients received vasopressors and 79 (31%) received renal replacement therapy.\n\n The median time to in-hospital deterioration was 3 days (IQR 16).\n\n In the multivariable Cox model, older age (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 131 [109157] per 10-year increase), chronic cardiac disease (aHR 176 [108286]), chronic pulmonary disease (aHR 294 [148584]), higher concentrations of interleukin-6 (aHR 111 [95%CI 102120] per decile increase), and higher concentrations of D-dimer (aHR 110 [101119] per decile increase) were independently associated with in-hospital mortality.\n\n\nInterpretation\nCritical illness among patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in New York City is common and associated with a high frequency of invasive mechanical ventilation, extrapulmonary organ dysfunction, and substantial in-hospital mortality.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, National Institutes of Health, and the Columbia University Irving Institute for Clinical and Translational Research.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7237188","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Matthew J","surname":"Cummings","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Matthew R","surname":"Baldwin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Darryl","surname":"Abrams","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Samuel D","surname":"Jacobson","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Benjamin J","surname":"Meyer","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Elizabeth M","surname":"Balough","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Justin G","surname":"Aaron","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jan","surname":"Claassen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"LeRoy E","surname":"Rabbani","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jonathan","surname":"Hastie","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Beth R","surname":"Hochman","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"John","surname":"Salazar-Schicchi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Natalie H","surname":"Yip","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Daniel","surname":"Brodie","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Max R","surname":"O'Donnell","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}],"References depth 2":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Petrilli CM, Jones SA, Yang J, et al.

study was to identify influenza-specific factors associated with ICU admission and mortality.\n\n Furthermore, influenza-specific pulmonary bacterial, fungal and viral co-infections were investigated.\n\n\nMethods\n199 influenza patients, admitted to two academic hospitals in the Netherlands between 01-10-2015 and 01-04-2016 were investigated of which 45/199 were admitted to the ICU.\n\n\nResults\nA history of Obstructive/Central Sleep Apnea Syndrome, myocardial infarction, dyspnea, influenza type A, BMI?&gt;?30, the development of renal failure and bacterial and fungal co-infections, were observed more frequently in patients who were admitted to the ICU, compared with patients at the normal ward.\n\n Co-infections were evident in 55.6% of ICU-admitted patients, compared with 20.1% of patients at the normal ward, mainly caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Aspergillus fumigatus.\n\n Non-survivors suffered from diabetes mellitus and (pre-existent) renal failure more often.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe current study indicates that a history of OSAS/CSAS, myocardial infarction and BMI?&gt;?30 might be related to ICU admission in influenza patients.\n\n Second, ICU patients develop more pulmonary co-infections.\n\n Last, (pre-existent) renal failure and diabetes mellitus are more often observed in non-survivors.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7125534","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

creating much confusion and making comparisons difficult.\n\n Similarly, strong debate exists on the validity and clinical relevance of animal models of ARF; on choices of fluid management and of end-points for trials of new interventions in this field; and on how information technology can be used to assist this process.\n\n Accordingly, we sought to review the available evidence, make recommendations and delineate key questions for future studies.\n\n\nMethods\nWe undertook a systematic review of the literature using Medline and PubMed searches.\n\n We determined a list of key questions and convened a 2-day consensus conference to develop summary statements via a series of alternating breakout and plenary sessions.\n\n In these sessions, we identified supporting evidence and generated recommendations and/or directions for future research.\n\n\nResults\nWe found sufficient consensus on 47 questions to allow the development of recommendations.\n\n Importantly, we were

Critically Ill Patients","abstract":"Objective\nTo identify the associations between the duration of endotracheal intubation and developing post-extubational supraglottic and infraglottic aspiration (PEA) and subsequent aspiration pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nThis was a retrospective observational study from January 2009 to November 2014 of all adult patients who had non-neurologic critical illness, required endotracheal intubation and were referred for videofluoroscopic swallowing study.\n\n Demographic information, intensive care unit (ICU) admission diagnosis, severity of critical illness, duration of endotracheal intubation, length of stay in ICU, presence of PEA and severity of dysphagia were reviewed.\n\n\nResults\nSeventy-four patients were enrolled and their PEA frequency was 59%.\n\n Patients with PEA had significantly longer endotracheal intubation durations than did those without (median [interquartile range]: 15 [9-21] vs.\n\n 10 [6-15] days; p=0.02).\n\n In multivariate logistic regression analysis, the endotracheal intubation duration was significantly associated with PEA (odds ratio, 1.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.18; p=0.04).\n\n Spearman correlation analysis of intubation duration and dysphagia severity showed a positive linear association (r=0.282, p=0.02).\n\n The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) of endotracheal intubation duration for developing PEA and aspiration pneumonia were 0.665 (95% CI, 0.542-0.788; p=0.02) and 0.727 (95% CI, 0.614-0.840; p=0.001), respectively.\n\n\nConclusion\nIn non-neurologic critically ill patients, the duration of endotracheal intubation was independently associated with PEA development.\n\n Additionally, the duration was positively correlated with dysphagia severity and may be helpful for identifying patients who require a swallowing evaluation after extubation.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4654083","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Korean

Therefore, we sought to characterize the prevalence and outcomes of COVID-19 in a live registry of heart failure patients across an integrated health care system in Connecticut.\nMethods\nIn this retrospective analysis, the Yale Heart Failure Registry (NCT04237701) that includes 26,703 patients with heart failure across a 6-hospital integrated health care system in Connecticut was queried on April 16th, 2020 for all patients tested for COVID-19. Sociodemographic and geospatial data as well as, clinical management, respiratory failure, and patient mortality were obtained via the real-time registry. Data on COVID-19 specific care was extracted by retrospective chart review.\nResults\nCOVID-19 testing was performed on 900 symptomatic patients, comprising 3.4% of the Yale Heart Failure Registry (N = 26,703). Overall, 206 (23%) were COVID- 19+. As compared to COVID-19-, these patients were more likely to be older, black, have hypertension, coronary artery disease, and were less likely to be on renin angiotensin blockers (P&lt;0.05, all). COVID-19- patients tended to be more diffusely spread across the state whereas COVID-19+ were largely clustered around urban centers. 20% of COVID-19+ patients died, and age was associated with increased risk of death [OR 1.92 95% CI (1.33-2.78); P&lt;0.001]. Among COVID-19+ patients who were &gt;=85 years of age rates of hospitalization were 87%, rates of death 36%, and continuing hospitalization 62% at time of manuscript preparation.\nConclusions\nIn this real-world snapshot of COVID-19 infection among a large cohort of heart failure patients, we found that a small proportion had undergone testing. Patients found to be COVID-19+ tended to be black with multiple comorbidities and clustered around lower socioeconomic status communities. Elderly COVID-19+ patients were very likely to be admitted to the hospital and experience high rates of mortality.\nIntroduction\nThe novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a pandemic since its initial outbreak in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. Risk factors for severe outcomes have been increasingly reported. Early reports from China indicated that patients with underlying cardiovascular disease had a 10.5% mortality rate compared with 2.3% case fatality rate in the general population. Data from European and North American infection hotspots suggest that older age, hypertension, diabetes, and coronary artery disease are associated with higher odds of mortality. Therefore, it might be postulated that COVID-19 may be uniquely endangering to patients with heart failure, the most common cause of death and disability in the United States. However, very little is known about the prevalence of infection among heart failure patients in COVID-19 endemic regions and the risk factors associated with clinical deterioration.\nThe Yale New Haven Health System is one of the largest academic integrated health care systems in the U.S., its 6 hospitals (2,681 licensed beds) care for the majority of heart failure patients in Connecticut. We created a curated real-time registry within this system:the Yale Heart Failure Registry (NCT04237701):that currently includes 26,703 patients with a diagnosis of HF and contains detailed information about demographics, comorbidities, laboratory and imaging studies, medications, and clinical outcomes including hospital readmissions. The aim of this report is to describe the demographic characteristics, coexisting conditions, and early outcomes among this real- world registry of heart failure patients tested for COVID-19 in a hotspot.\nMethods\nStudy cohort\nWe queried the Yale Heart Failure Registry (NCT04237701) on April 16th, 2020 for patients who were tested for COVID-19. Briefly, the Yale Heart Failure Registry is a live registry of patients seen within the integrated Yale New Haven Health System (Fig 1) that meet the following evaluation logic: the patient has at least one encounter within the health system in the last 3 years and meets one of the four criteria (1) Problem List contains the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine-Clinical Terms (SNOMED-CT) concept heart failure, (2) Encounter Diagnosis contains SNOMED-CT concept heart failure for two or more face to face encounters within the last 12 months, (3) Encounter Diagnosis contains a SNOMED-CT concept heart failure for at least 1 admission within the last 12 months, (4) Coded Diagnosis is contained within one of the DRGs (291, 292, 293) for Heart Failure for at least 1 admission within the last 12 months. Of note, conditions in the Yale Electronic Health Record (EHR) use SNOMED-CT as the standard vocabulary for diagnosis codes. Registry exclusions are age&lt;18, cardiac failure after obstetrical surgery or other procedure, or cardiac insufficiency during or resulting from a procedure. The registry has detailed information about demographics, comorbidities, laboratories, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), medications, geospatial mapping, and clinical outcomes (including hospital readmissions). Registry data is linked to the National Death Index, a centralized database of death record information on file in state vital statistics offices. The registry is updated daily and can be queried for clinically relevant questions aimed at research and quality improvement. The registry has undergone extensive quality control by independent cardiologists and pharmacists; it has been found to have near identical patient characteristics to published registry data on heart failure patients. The institutional review board (IRB) at the Yale University School of Medicine approved the study and waived the requirement for informed consent.\nPopulation distribution of patients in the Yale Heart Failure Registry*.\n*Darker shading represents a greater density of patients in the registry from a zip code.\nStandardization of COVID-19 treatment across the health system\nYale New Haven Health System has one single integrated electronic health record system across 6 hospitals. This single instance of Epic (Epic Corporation, Verona WI) has a common drug formulary, set of decision support tools, and order sets standardized across the System. Expert clinicians from different hospitals participated to create standardized COVID-19 order sets, documentation templates, and smart phrases for use in all hospitals. Physicians and other providers, however, can enter specific individual orders outside of COVID order sets as appropriate for individual patients but there is system wide guidance to standardize treatment (S1 and S2 Figs). In brief, admitted patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection are initiated on treatment if they were either hypoxic or had evidence of lower respiratory tract involvement (either by symptoms and/or chest radiography). Hydroxychloroquine is utilized for its antiviral properties. For patients who required mechanical ventilation, ECMO or had a combination of hypoxia with a hyperinflammatory state, tocilizumab is used for its anti- inflammatory properties via IL-6 receptor inhibition.\nStatistical analysis\nContinuous variables are presented as median and interquartile range (IQR) and categorical variables are expressed as number of patients (percentage). chi2 and Mann- Whitney rank sum tests was used to compare categorical variables. Predictors of testing COVID-19+ was done using stepwise logistic regression with selection by Akaike information criterion (AIC) and evaluated by a C-statistic and DeLong's test (R version 3.5.3, MASS and pROC package). Logistic regression was used to assess the association between demographic variables and outcomes. All statistical tests were 2- tailed, and statistical significance was defined as P&lt;0.05. Analyses were performed using Stata version 16.1 (Statacorp).\nResults\nBased on data extracted from the Yale Heart Failure Registry on April 16th, 2020, we found that 900 patients, 3.4% of the total registry patients (N = 26,703) had been tested for SARS-COV-2. Per the Yale New Haven Health System protocol, testing was only performed on symptomatic patients. Of note, in the overall Yale Haven Health system, 22,254 patients had been tested and 6,357 (30.1%) were COVID-19+ as of April 16th2020. Most recent algorithms for treatment of COVID+ patients across the entire health care system are shown in S1 and S2 Figs. Patients in the registry, stratified by COVID-19 testing versus not and according to result, are shown in Table 1.\nBaseline clinical characteristics of patients according to testing status.\nCharacteristic	COVID-19 Not Tested	COVID-19 Tested	P	COVID-19-	COVID-19+	P	 	Number	25,803	900		694	206		 	Age	76 (65-85)	73 (62-82)	&lt;0.001	72 (61-81)	78 (65-87)	&lt;0.001	 	Female	11,701 (45.3%)	457 (50.8%)	&lt;0.001	344 (49.6%)	113 (54.9%)	0.18	 	Black	3,414 (13.2%)	205 (22.8%)	&lt;0.001	143 (20.6%)	62 (30.1%)	&lt;0.05	 	White	19,824 (76.8%)	598 (66.4%)	&lt;0.001	479 (69.0%)	119 (57.8%)	&lt;0.05	 	Medicare	11,032 (42.8%)	334 (37.1%)	&lt;0.001	268 (38.6%)	66 (32.0%)	0.086	 	Medicaid	2,040 (7.9%)	115 (12.8%)	&lt;0.001	95 (13.7%)	20 (9.7%)	0.13	 	BMI	28.91 (24.82-34.41)	29.12 (24.26-35.26)	0.84	29.28 (24.43-35.26)	28.67 (23.91-35.14)	0.29	 	HFrEF	4,052 (22.8%)	189 (21.0%)	0.14	153 (22.0%)	36 (17.5%)	0.16	 	Hypertension	18,001 (69.8%)	665 (73.9%)	0.008	501 (72.2%)	164 (79.6%)	&lt;0.05	 	COPD	8,006 (31.0%)	263 (29.2%)	0.25	196 (28.2%)	67 (32.5%)	0.24	 	CAD	8,006 (31.0%)	269 (29.9%)	0.47	196 (28.2%)	73 (35.4%)	&lt;0.05	 	Renal Disease	7,131 (27.6%)	317 (35.2%)	&lt;0.001	238 (34.3%)	79 (38.3%)	0.28	 	NT-proBNP	1733 (592-4714)	2092 (648-6515)	&lt;0.001	2276 (704-6598)	1357 (502-5281)	&lt;0.05	 	Sodium	140 (138-141)	139 (137-142)	0.016	139 (137-142)	139 (137-142)	0.49	 	Chloride	103 (100-105)	102 (98-105)	0.003	102 (98-105)	102 (99-106)	0.68	 	Creatinine	1.1 (.88-1.46)	1.2 (.88-1.9)	&lt;0.001	1.19 (.87-1.88)	1.3 (.93-1.97)	&lt;0.05	 	BUN	22 (16-31)	26 (17-41.5)	&lt;0.001	25 (16-40)	30 (19-46)	&lt;0.05	 	HbA1c	6.2 (5.7-7.3)	6.3 (5.7-7.5)	0.08	6.3 (5.7-7.5)	6.5 (5.7-7.7)	0.6	 	ACE-I/ARB	13,354 (51.8%)	312 (34.7%)	&lt;0.001	254 (36.6%)	58 (28.2%)	&lt;0.05	 	ARNI	2,077 (8.0%)	54 (6.0%)	0.026	48 (6.9%)	6 (2.9%)	&lt;0.05	 	Beta Blocker	13,568 (52.6%)	429 (47.7%)	0.004	335 (48.3%)	94 (45.6%)	0.51	 	CCB	6,879 (26.7%)	283 (31.4%)	0.001	214 (30.8%)	69 (33.5%)	0.47	 	SGLT2i	810 (3.1%)	25 (2.8%)	0.54	24 (3.5%)	1 (0.5%)	0.02	 	Warfarin	2,811 (10.9%)	81 (9.0%)	0.07	65 (9.4%)	16 (7.8%)	0.48	 	NOAC	7,052 (27.3%)	267 (29.7%)	0.12	220 (31.7%)	47 (22.8%)	0.01	 	Diuretic	15,913 (61.7%)	518 (57.6%)	0.013	419 (60.4%)	99 (48.1%)	0.002	 	Statin	16,761 (65.0%)	556 (61.8%)	0.05	439 (63.3%)	117 (56.8%)	&lt;0.05	 	\nData are presented as median (IQR) for continuous measures, and n (%) for categorical measures.\nOf the HF registry patients tested for COVID-19, 23% were positive. Those who tested positive were significantly more likely to be older, black, hypertensive, and with coronary artery disease. They had higher BUN and creatinine at baseline. They were significantly less likely to be on renin angiotensin system (RAS) blockers at time of diagnosis. Of note, use of Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), Direct- Acting Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs), diuretics, and statins were also lower in this patient cohort. A significantly higher percentage of these patients were on Medicaid than in the overall cohort. Multivariable modeling revealed that black race, hypertension, lung disease, less DOAC and statin use, and number of prior hospital admissions were all independent predictors of testing positive for COVID-19 (P&lt;0.05 all; AUC 0.69).\nFig 1 demonstrates the geospatial mapping of all patients who are included in the Yale Heart Failure Registry. It includes patients from all over Connecticut, Westchester County, NY, and Western Rhode Island. Fig 2 shows patients who tested positive and negative for COVID-19, with each dot representing a geographical location. As shown, patients who tested negative tended to more diffusely spread across the state, but those who tested positive were largely clustered around the cities of Bridgeport and New Haven, Connecticut.\n(a). Geospatial mapping of heart failure patients who tested negative for COVID-19. Dots represent individual patient home addresses. (b). Geospatial mapping of heart failure patients who tested positive for COVID-19. Dots represent individual patient home addresses.\nTesting for associations between baseline demographics (age, sex, race, BMI, and HFrEF) and key clinical outcomes: intensive care unit (ICU) admission, intubation, and death revealed the following: BMI was associated with an increased risk of ICU admission [OR 1.04 95% CI (1.00-1.08); P = 0.036] and intubation [OR 1.07 95% CI (1.02-1.12); P = 0.004]. Only age (increments of 10 years) was associated with increased risk of death [OR 1.92 95% CI (1.33-2.78); P&lt;0.001].\nTable 2 compares the clinical characteristics and admission laboratories of COVID- 19+ patients who are alive versus who died at the time of this analysis. Of the heart failure patients testing positive for the virus, 20% died. These patients were more likely to be older (mean age 87) and white. Most patients who died had heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF;  90%) and high rates of comorbid conditions. They also had significantly more abnormal values for baseline BUN, Creatinine, and N- terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), reflecting more advanced cardiovascular and renal disease.

Those who died were significantly more likely to have been treated with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and atazanavir, likely reflecting more advanced disease. Those who died were also significantly more likely to be admitted to the ICU and require intensive oxygen support and intubation.\nMedical and supportive interventions in COVID-19+ patients according to clinical outcome.\nICU = Intensive Care Unit; HFNC = High flow nasal canula; NIPPV = Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation; CMO = comfort measures only.\nDiscussion\nIn this real-world analysis of a live heart failure registry across a large integrated health care system, we found that &lt;4% of patients (900/26,703) had symptoms that met criteria and were able to get COVID-19 testing. Among the patients tested, 23% were positive, and they tended to cluster around the cities of Bridgeport and New Haven.\nCOVID-19+ patients were more likely to be black, have comorbid conditions, and were less likely to be on renin angiotensin blockade at time of testing. Of the COVID-19+ heart failure patients, 20% died, and they tended to be elderly (mean age 87) white patients with HFpEF. In their entirety, these data demonstrate the need for greater geographical based testing and interventions, particularly in vulnerable communities, and a greater focus on goals of care discussions among elderly heart failure patients who test positive.\nThis is the first report describing the impact of COVID-19 infection in a geographically contained population of heart failure patients under the purview of an integrated health care system, providing insight into how such a system can be used to analyze early data on diagnosis status and outcomes ascertainment among its population. We found that although testing was scattered across the state, those who tested positive tended to cluster around two cities:New Haven and Bridgeport, two of the cities with the lowest median household income in the state ($41,142 and $45,441 versus $76,106 for the state), and the highest percentage of black inhabitants (33.0% and 35.3%, versus 12% for the state). This disparity in both testing, and infection rates has been recently noted, with preliminary data showing that underrepresented minorities are developing COVID-19 infection more frequently. The causes for this finding are multifaceted and have been hypothesized to include the disproportionate number of minorities who are exposed to COVID-19 in their roles as &quot;essential workers&quot; and who spread the disease to their residentially segregated communities. Also, situations associated with lower socioeconomic conditions, such as housing insecurity and access to health care barriers, can facilitate the spread of infectious diseases. Taken together, these findings suggest an urgent need for a more nuanced strategy to tackle the disparate impact of the virus across vulnerable populations, including those with heart failure who are at particularly high risk.\nInterestingly, we noted a significantly greater use of renin angiotensin blockade in both untested and negative patients in the registry. Compared to patients in the registry on an ACE-I/ARB, those not on these therapies were 50% more likely to be COVID-19+. Furthermore, rates were also significantly lower than in patients who tested negative.\nWhereas these are cross-sectional observational data, they corroborate recent reports from China demonstrating a potential benefit of these therapies among COVID-19+ patients. At the very least, this might suggest that these therapies do not increase risk in patients with heart failure and supports the AHA/ACC/HFSA statement supporting ongoing use of renin angiotensin blockade in heart failure patients during the pandemic.\nOur study shows that a large portion of deaths occurred in elderly patients. High rates of mortality and morbidity have been described in older patients from Italy; however, less than 2% of their cohort was &gt;80 years. In our cohort, we noted 33% of COVID-19+ positive patients to be &gt;=85 years old. These patients had hospitalization rates of approximately 90%, 36% had died at the time of this analysis, and all the rest except one patient remained hospitalized. This suggests that special importance should be given to elderly individuals with HF when discussing testing distribution and early access to preventive therapies upon availability, such as vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. This also suggests an urgent need for early goals of care discussions in elderly heart failure patients who test positive for COVID-19+ given long hospitalizations and high mortality rates despite aggressive treatment.\nLimitations\nOur study has several notable limitations. First, we only included patients who were tested for COVID-19+ and other patients in the registry with the infection might have been uncounted due to either been asymptomatic, did not pursue testing for symptoms, or may have not been offered diagnostic testing. This is currently the practice at most medical centers across the United States. As such our findings should be considered a conservative estimate of the expanse of COVID19+ HF patients in the communities covered by the registry. Second, despite laboratory testing and interventions currently being performed in a protocolized manner across the Yale New Haven Health Care System, some patients might have been hospitalized prior to widespread application of this care pathway. Third, many of the patients described in the study remain hospitalized, leading to likely underreporting of total deaths from COVID-19+ in our cohort. Finally, the study has limitations inherent in any registry, where a high degree of granularity about heart failure is missing and all testing is solely performed at the clinician's discretion.\nConclusions\nIn this real-world snapshot of COVID-19 infection among a large cohort of heart failure patients under the purview of an integrated health care system during peak infection time, we found that a very small percentage underwent testing. Patients found to be COVID-19+ tended to be black with multiple comorbidities and clustered around lower socioeconomic status communities in the State. Elderly COVID-19+ patients were very likely to be admitted to the hospital and experience high rates of mortality.\nSupporting information\nReferences\nCardiovascular Considerations for Patients, Health Care Workers, and Health Systems During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic\nClinical Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China\nBaseline Characteristics and Outcomes of 1591 Patients Infected With SARS-CoV-2 Admitted to ICUs of the Lombardy Region, Italy\nCovid-19 in Critically Ill Patients in the Seattle Region:Case Series\nMedical Therapy for Heart Failure With Reduced Ejection Fraction: The CHAMP-HF Registry\nhttps://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/hartfordcityconnecticut,newhavencitycon necticut,bridgeportcityconnecticut,CT,US/INC110218\nCOVID-19 and African Americans\nAssociation of Inpatient Use of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors and Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers with Mortality Among Patients With Hypertension Hospitalized With COVID-19\nRenin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System Inhibitors in Patients with Covid-19\nFair Allocation of Scarce Medical Resources in the Time of Covid-19\nPalliative care in congestive heart failure\n10.1371/journal.pone.0238829.r001\nDecision Letter 0\nLazzeri\nChiara\nThis is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.\nTransfer Alert\nThis paper was transferred from another journal.

Although everyday new data on COVID-19 is being published, its implications in patients with heart failure are still being elucidated and our study contributes to this knowledge by demonstrating early outcomes among these patients, using a health care system that facilitates outcomes detection and ascertainment in our region. We have modified the discussion to better reflect this, as shown below (additions underlined):\nPage 12, lines 181-183:\n&quot;This is the first report describing the impact of COVID-19 infection in a geographically contained population of heart failure patients under the purview of an integrated health care system, providing insight into how such a system can be used to analyze early data on diagnosis status and outcomes ascertainment among its population.&quot;\nAlso, we agree that the SARS-CoV-2 transmission among individuals with low SES may be a function of higher spread of infectious diseases in general. We have added this as one of the plausible explanations of our findings (additions underlined):\nPage 13, lines 196-198:\n&quot;The causes for this finding are multifaceted and have been hypothesized to include the disproportionate number of minorities who are exposed to COVID-19 in their roles as &quot;essential workers&quot; and who spread the disease to their residentially segregated communities.

in China","abstract":"Background\nSince December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7092819","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical

COVID-19-associated mortality.\n Access to healthcare and related social determinants of health are at the core of this disparity.\n To explore the geographical links between race and COVID-19 mortality, we created descriptive maps of COVID-19 mortality rates in relation to the percentage of populations self-identifying as African-American across the USA, by state, and Pennsylvania (PA), by county.\n In addition, we used bivariate and logistic regression analyses to quantify the statistical relationship between these variables, and control for area-level demographic, healthcare access, and comorbidity risk factors.\n We found that COVID-19 mortality rates were generally higher in areas that had higher African-American populations, particularly in the northeast USA and eastern PA.\n These relationships were quantified through Pearson correlations showing significant positive associations at the state and county level.\n At the US state-level, percent African-American population was the only significant correlate of COVID-19 mortality rate.\n In PA at the county-level, higher percent African-American population was associated with higher COVID-19 mortality rate even after controlling for area-level confounders.\n More resources should be allocated to address high COVID-19 mortality rates among African-American

Disparities-Associated COVID-19 Mortality among Minority Populations in the US","abstract":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a betacoronavirus that causes the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is highly transmissible and pathogenic for humans and may cause life-threatening disease and mortality, especially in individuals with underlying comorbidities.\n First identified in an outbreak in Wuhan, China, COVID-19 is affecting more than 185 countries and territories around the world, with more than 15,754,651 confirmed cases and more than 640,029 deaths.\n Since December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 transmission has become a global threat, which includes confirmed cases in all 50 states within the United States (US).\n As of 25 July 2020, the Johns Hopkins Whiting School of Engineering Center for Systems Science and Engineering reports more than 4,112,651 cases and 145,546 deaths.\n To date, health disparities are associated with COVID-19 mortality among underserved populations.\n Here, the author explores potential underlying reasons for reported disproportionate, increased risks of mortality among African Americans and Hispanics/Latinos with COVID-19 compared with non-Hispanic Whites.\n The author examines the underlying clinical implications that may predispose minority populations and the adverse clinical outcomes that may contribute to increased risk of mortality.\n Government and community-based strategies to safeguard minority populations at risk for increased morbidity and mortality are essential.\n Underserved populations living in poverty with limited access to social services across the US are more likely to have underlying medical conditions and are among the most vulnerable.\n Societal and cultural barriers for ethnic minorities to achieve health equity are systemic issues that may be addressed only through shifts in governmental policies, producing long-overdue, substantive changes to end health care inequities.\n","id":"PMC7466083","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"Donald

positioning when users opt to geotag their tweets with their current location.\n We analyse a Twitter dataset with more than six million geotagged tweets posted in Australia, and we demonstrate that Twitter can be a reliable source for studying human mobility patterns.\n Our analysis shows that geotagged tweets can capture rich features of human mobility, such as the diversity of movement orbits among individuals and of movements within and between cities.\n We also find that short- and long-distance movers both spend most of their time in large metropolitan areas, in contrast with intermediate-distance movers movements, reflecting the impact of different modes of travel.\n Our study provides solid evidence that Twitter can indeed be a useful proxy for tracking and predicting

alternative approaches could provide necessary information efficiently to aid policy makers and health bodies when dealing with a pandemic.\n The following work presents a methodology by which Twitter data surrounding the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK is harvested and analysed using two main approaches.\n The first is an investigation into localized outbreak predictions by developing a prototype early-warning system using the distribution of total tweet volume.\n The temporal lag between the rises in the number of COVID-19 related tweets and officially reported deaths by Public Health England (PHE) is observed to be 627 days for various UK cities which matches the temporal lag values found in the literature.\n To better understand the topics of discussion and attitudes of people surrounding the pandemic, the second approach is an in-depth behavioural analysis assessing the public opinion and response to government policies such as the introduction of face-coverings.\n Using topic modelling, nine distinct topics are identified within the corpus of COVID-19 tweets, of which the themes ranged from retail to government bodies.\n Sentiment analysis on a subset of mask related tweets revealed sentiment spikes corresponding to major news and announcements.\n A Named Entity Recognition (NER) algorithm is trained and applied in a semi-supervised manner to recognise tweets containing location keywords within the unlabelled corpus and achieved a precision of 81.6%.\n Overall, these approaches allowed extraction of temporal trends relating to PHE case

their distribution as well as dispelling misinformation regarding vaccine trials, safety, and efficacy.\n This lack of education has greatly contributed to COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and will increase disparities in vaccine uptake.\n Moreover, timely vaccinations are also essential to curtailing virus transmission and the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants that may evade the immune response produced by the three existing COVID-19 vaccines.\n","id":"PMC8151325","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"James E.

By extracting and analyzing all available published clinical data, we identified several major clinical characteristics associated with increased disease severity and mortality among patients with COVID-19. Specifically, preexisting chronic conditions such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes are strongly associated with an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19; surprisingly, however, we found no correlation between chronic liver disease and increased disease severity.\n In addition, we found that both acute cardiac injury and acute kidney injury are highly correlated with an increased risk of COVID-19-related mortality.\n Given the high risk of comorbidity and the high mortality rate associated with tissue damage, organ function should be monitored closely in patients diagnosed with COVID-19, and this approach should be included when establishing new guidelines for managing these high-risk patients.\n Moreover, additional clinical data are needed in order to determine whether a supportive therapy can help mitigate the development of severe, potentially fatal complications, and further studies are needed to identify the pathophysiology and the mechanism underlying this novel coronavirus-associated infectious disease.\n Taken together, these findings provide new insights regarding clinical strategies for improving the management and outcome of patients with COVID-19.","id":"PMC7187729","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"AAAS","authors":[{"firstname":"Xinhui","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xuexian","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Xuexian","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhaoxian","surname":"Cai","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Zhaoxian","surname":"Cai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaotian","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiaotong","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Xiaotong","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Junxia","surname":"Min","email":"junxiamin@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Junxia","surname":"Min","email":"junxiamin@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fudi","surname":"Wang","email":"fwang@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Fudi","surname":"Wang","email":"fwang@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2002032","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China","abstract":"Background\nSince December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the

2019 (Covid-19) has not been well studied.\n\n\nMethods\nWe carried out a population-based casecontrol study in the Lombardy region of Italy.\n\n A total of 6272 case patients in whom infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was confirmed between February 21 and March 11, 2020, were matched to 30,759 beneficiaries of the Regional Health Service (controls) according to sex, age, and municipality of residence.\n\n Information about the use of selected drugs and patients clinical profiles was obtained from regional databases of health care use.\n\n Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for associations between drugs and infection, with adjustment for confounders, were estimated by means of logistic regression.\n\n\nResults\nAmong both case patients and controls, the mean (SD) age was 6813 years, and 37% were women.\n\n The use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs was more common among case patients than among controls, as was the use of other antihypertensive and non-antihypertensive drugs, and case patients had a worse clinical profile.\n\n Use of ARBs or ACE inhibitors did not show any association with Covid-19 among case patients overall (adjusted odds ratio, 0.95 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.86 to 1.05] for ARBs and 0.96 [95% CI, 0.87 to 1.07] for ACE inhibitors) or among patients who had a severe or fatal course of the disease (adjusted odds ratio, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.63 to 1.10] for ARBs and 0.91 [95% CI, 0.69 to 1.21] for ACE inhibitors), and no association between these variables was found according to sex.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn this large, population-based study, the use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs was more frequent among patients with Covid-19 than among controls because of their higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease.\n\n However, there was no evidence that ACE inhibitors or ARBs affected the risk of

continuation or discontinuation of reninangiotensin system inhibitor therapy were excluded.\n\n Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to continuation or discontinuation of their reninangiotensin system inhibitor using permuted block randomisation, with allocation concealed using a secure web-based randomisation system.\n\n The primary outcome was a global rank score in which participants were ranked across four hierarchical tiers incorporating time to death, duration of mechanical ventilation, time on renal replacement or vasopressor therapy, and multiorgan dysfunction during the hospitalisation.\n\n Primary analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population.\n\n The REPLACE COVID trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.\n\ngov, NCT04338009.\n\n\nFindings\nBetween March 31 and Aug 20, 2020, 152 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to either continue or discontinue reninangiotensin system inhibitor therapy (continuation group n=75; discontinuation group n=77).\n\n Mean age of participants was 62 years (SD 12), 68 (45%) were female, mean body-mass index was 33 kg/m2 (SD 8), and 79 (52%) had diabetes.\n\n Compared with discontinuation of reninangiotensin system inhibitors, continuation had no effect on the global rank score (median rank 73 [IQR 40110] for continuation vs 81 [38117] for discontinuation; ?-coefficient 8 [95% CI ?13 to 29]).\n\n There were 16 (21%) of 75 participants in the continuation arm versus 14 (18%) of 77 in the discontinuation arm who required intensive care unit admission or invasive mechanical ventilation, and 11 (15%) of 75 participants in the continuation group versus ten (13%) of 77 in the discontinuation group died.\n\n 29 (39%) participants in the continuation group and 28 (36%) participants in the discontinuation group had at least one adverse event (?2 test of adverse events between treatment groups p=077).\n\n There was no difference in blood pressure, serum potassium, or creatinine during follow-up across the two groups.\n\n\nInterpretation\nConsistent with international society recommendations, reninangiotensin system inhibitors can be safely continued in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19.\nFunding\nREPLACE COVID Investigators, REPLACE COVID Trial Social Fundraising Campaign, and FastGrants.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7832152","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

inhibitors in COVID-19 (ACEI-COVID): a prospective, parallel group, randomised, controlled, open-label trial","abstract":"Background\nSARS-CoV-2 entry in human cells depends on angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, which can be upregulated by inhibitors of the reninangiotensin system (RAS).\n\n We aimed to test our hypothesis that discontinuation of chronic treatment with ACE-inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) mitigates the course o\f recent-onset COVID-19.\nMethods\nACEI-COVID was a parallel group, randomised, controlled, open-label trial done at 35 centres in Austria and Germany.\n\n Patients aged 18 years and older were enrolled if they presented with recent symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and were chronically treated with ACEIs or ARBs.\n\n Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to discontinuation or continuation of RAS inhibition for 30 days.\n\n Primary outcome was the maximum sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score within 30 days, where death was scored with the maximum achievable SOFA score.\n\n Secondary endpoints were area under the death-adjusted SOFA score (AUCSOFA), mean SOFA score, admission to the intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, and death.\n\n Analyses were done on a modified intention-to-treat basis.\n\n This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.\n\ngov, NCT04353596.\n\n\nFindings\nBetween April 20, 2020, and Jan 20, 2021, 204 patients (median age 75 years [IQR 6680], 37% females) were randomly assigned to discontinue (n=104) or continue (n=100) RAS inhibition.\n\n Within 30 days, eight (8%) of 104 died in the discontinuation group and 12 (12%) of 100 patients died in the continuation group (p=042).\n\n There was no significant difference in the primary endpoint between the discontinuation and continuation group (median [IQR] maximum SOFA score 000 (000200) vs 100 (000300); p=012).\n\n Discontinuation was associated with a significantly lower AUCSOFA (000 [000925] vs 350 [0002350]; p=0040), mean SOFA score (000 [000031] vs 012 [000078]; p=0040), and 30-day SOFA score (000 [1090th percentile, 000120] vs 000 [0002400]; p=0023).\n\n At 30 days, 11 (11%) in the discontinuation group and 23 (23%) in the continuation group had signs of organ dysfunction (SOFA score ?1) or were dead (p=0017).\n\n There were no significant differences for mechanical ventilation (10 (10%) vs 8 (8%), p=087) and admission to intensive care unit (20 [19%] vs 18 [18%], p=096) between the discontinuation and continuation group.\n\n\nInterpretation\nDiscontinuation of RAS-inhibition in COVID-19 had no significant effect on the maximum severity of COVID-19 but may lead to a faster and better recovery.\n\n The decision to continue or discontinue should be made on an individual basis, considering the risk profile, the indication for RAS inhibition, and the availability of alternative therapies and outpatient monitoring options.\n\n\nFunding\nAustrian Science Fund

Using data from 228,722 Veterans with a history of hypertension who received COVID-19 testing at the VA, we investigated whether the use of ACEI or ARB over the two years prior to the index date was associated with increased odds of (1) a positive COVID-19 test, and (2) a severe outcome (hospitalization, mortality, and use of intensive care unit (ICU) and/or mechanical ventilation) among COVID-19-positive patients.\n\n We used logistic regression with and without propensity score weighting (PSW) to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for the association between ACEI/ARB use and a positive COVID-19 test result.\n\n The association between medication use and COVID-19 outcome severity was examined using multinomial logistic regression comparing participants who were not hospitalized to participants who were hospitalized, were admitted to the ICU, used a mechanical ventilator, or died.\n\n All models were adjusted for relevant covariates, including demographics (age, sex, race, ethnicity), selected comorbidities, and the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI).\n\n\nResults\nThe use of ACEI significantly decreased the odds of a positive COVID-19 test among Veterans with hypertension (OR = 0.917, (0.887, 0.948) and OR = 0.926, (0.894, 0.958) with PSW).\n\n The use of ACEI, but not of ARB, was also associated with significantly increased odds of using mechanical ventilators (OR = 1.265, (1.010, 1.584) and OR = 1.210, (1.053, 1.39) with PSW) among all COVID-19 inpatients compared to outpatients.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn this study of Veterans with hypertension, ACEI was significantly associated with decreased odds of testing positive for COVID-19.

Scarce resources allocation in the COVID-19 outbreak","abstract":"After initially emerging in China, the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak has advanced rapidly.\n The World Health Organization (WHO) has recently declared it a pandemic, with Europe becoming its new epicentre.\n Italy has so far been the most severely hit European country and demand for critical care in the northern region currently exceeds its supply.\n This raises significant ethical concerns, among which is the allocation of scarce resources.\n Professionals are considering the prioritisation of patients most likely to survive over those with remote chances, and this news has triggered an intense debate about the right of every individual to access healthcare.\n The proposed analysis suggests that the national emergency framework in which prioritisation criteria are currently enforced should not lead us to perceive scarce resources allocation as something new.\n From an ethical perspective, the novelty of the current emergency is not grounded in the devastating effects of scarce resources allocation, which is rife in recent and present clinical practice.\n Rather, it has to do with the extraordinarily high number of people who find themselves personally affected by the implications of scarce resources allocation and who suddenly realise that the principle of equals should be treated equally may no longer be applicable.\n Along with the need to allocate appropriate additional financial resources to support the healthcare system, and thus to mitigate the scarcity of resources, the analysis insists on the relevance of a medical ethics perspective that does not place the burden of care and choice solely on physicians.\n","id":"PMC7242866","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BMJ Publishing Group","authors":[{"firstname":"Chiara","surname":"Mannelli","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMp2005689","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The toughest triage:allocating ventilators in a pandemic","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1001/jama.2020.5046","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A framework for rationing ventilators and critical care beds during the COVID-19 pandemic","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1136/medethics-2020-106332","date":"2020-04-20","title":"Who gets the ventilator?

Detailed data on demographic characteristics, underlying medical conditions, and clinical outcomes for persons hospitalized with COVID-19 are needed to inform prevention strategies and community-specific intervention messages. For this report, CDC, the Georgia Department of Public Health, and eight Georgia hospitals (seven in metropolitan Atlanta and one in southern Georgia) summarized medical record-abstracted data for hospitalized adult patients with laboratory-confirmed* COVID-19 who were admitted during March 2020. Among 305 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, 61.6% were aged &lt;65 years, 50.5% were female, and 83.2% with known race/ethnicity were non-Hispanic black (black). Over a quarter of patients (26.2%) did not have conditions thought to put them at higher risk for severe disease, including being aged &gt;=65 years. The proportion of hospitalized patients who were black was higher than expected based on overall hospital admissions. In an adjusted time-to-event analysis, black patients were not more likely than were nonblack patients to receive invasive mechanical ventilation  (IMV) or to die during hospitalization (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.35-1.13). Given the overrepresentation of black patients within this hospitalized cohort, it is important for public health officials to ensure that prevention activities prioritize communities and racial/ethnic groups most affected by COVID-19. Clinicians and public officials should be aware that all adults, regardless of underlying conditions or age, are at risk for serious illness from COVID-19.\nHospitalized cases were selected to describe patients with severe manifestations of COVID-19 that warranted inpatient management. Data were collected from a convenience sample of 305 patients at seven hospitals in metropolitan Atlanta (five community hospitals, one university hospital, and one public hospital) and one community hospital in southern Georgia. Patients were selected sequentially from lists provided in real time by hospitals from a total of 698 patients aged &gt;=18 years who were hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 during March 1-March 30, 2020, including stays for observation and deaths in the emergency department. Over a 3-week period, data were abstracted from electronic medical records and recorded using Research Electronic Data Capture software (version 8.8.0; Vanderbilt University). Hospitalizations for patients transferred between participating hospitals or admitted multiple times to the same hospital were analyzed as a single hospitalization. Data on patient race/ethnicity, age, sex, body mass index (BMI), insurance status, residence (e.g., in a long-term care facility), risk factors for severe COVID-19 (based on currently available data and clinical expertise) , and outcomes were abstracted from medical records. Race was categorized as black (non-Hispanic) or nonblack (all other racial/ethnic groups), and age was analyzed in three groups: 18-49, 50-64, and &gt;=65 years. Fisher's exact tests for proportions and the Wilcoxon rank sum test or the Kruskal-Wallis H test for medians were used to test differences identified in descriptive analyses. Multivariable Cox proportional-hazards analysis was performed on the association between race and time to meeting a composite outcome of IMV or death, adjusting for age, sex, BMI, hospital, admission date, and underlying medical conditions (selected through a stepwise Akaike information criterion approach, which balances a model's fit against its complexity); censoring was used to account for patients still hospitalized without receiving IMV. P-values &lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant. R statistical software (version 3.6.3; The R Foundation) was used to conduct all analyses. \nAmong 305 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, the median age was 60 years (range = 23-95 years, interquartile range [IQR] = 46-69 years) (Figure 1); 50.5% of patients were female, and 284 (93%) were hospitalized in metropolitan Atlanta. Data on race/ethnicity were available for 297 (97.4%) patients, among whom, 247 (83.2%) were black, 32 (10.8%) were non-Hispanic white, eight (2.7%) were non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander, and 10 (3.4%) were Hispanic (Figure 2). Median age was not significantly different between black patients (60 years, IQR = 45.5-69.0 years) and nonblack patients (64.5 years, IQR = 44.8-74.0 years). Most patients had private insurance (40.1%) or Medicare (33.4%); 10.9% had Medicaid, and 14.9% were uninsured. Compared with nonblack patients, black patients were more likely to have Medicaid (13.5% versus 0.0%, p = 0.002) but not more likely to be uninsured. Overall, 20 (6.6%) patients resided in long-term care facilities before hospitalization. Current smoking was reported for 5.2% of patients.\nAge distribution of adults hospitalized with COVID-19 (N = 305) : eight hospitals, Georgia, March 2020\nAbbreviation: COVID-19 = coronavirus disease 2019.\nThe figure is a bar chart showing the age distribution of adults hospitalized with COVID-19 (N = 305) in eight hospitals in Georgia during March 2020.\nNumber of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (N = 305)* (A) and percentage who received invasive mechanical ventilation or died (B),  by race/ethnicity  : eight hospitals, Georgia, March 2020\nAbbreviations: COVID-19 = coronavirus disease 2019; IMV = invasive mechanical ventilation.\n* A total of 273 patients had available race/ethnicity data and known hospitalization outcomes.\n  Vertical bars represent 95% confidence intervals for proportions.\n  Black was defined as non-Hispanic black race/ethnicity; other includes all other racial/ethnic groups.\nThe figure is a bar chart (A) and scatter plot (B) showing the number of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (N = 305) and percentage who received invasive mechanical ventilation or died, by race/ethnicity, in eight hospitals in Georgia during March 2020.\nOverall, 225 (73.8%) patients had conditions considered high-risk for severe COVID-19 (Table 1). Diabetes was documented in 39.7% of patients. Diabetes was most common in patients aged 50-64 years (46.5%; p = 0.001) but was not significantly more common in black patients than in nonblack patients (41.7% versus 32.0%; p = 0.21). Cardiovascular disease, documented in 25.6% of patients, was more prevalent in those aged &gt;=65 years (47.0%; p&lt;0.001) but prevalence was similar in black (25.1%) and nonblack patients (30.0%) (p = 0.48). Overall, 20.3% of patients had chronic lung disease, with no significant differences by age or race. Asthma was documented in 10.5% of all patients and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in 5.2%. Severe obesity (BMI &gt;=40), present in 12.7% of patients, was most common in those aged 18-49 years (21.8%; p&lt;0.001). Severe obesity did not differ significantly by race, although median BMI was higher in black (31.4 [IQR = 27.6-36.9]) than in nonblack patients (29.6 [IQR = 24.3-32.5]; p = 0.003). Hypertension (not considered a high-risk condition) was documented in 67.5% of patients and was more common among black versus nonblack patients (69.6% versus 54.0%; p=0.047).\nUnderlying medical conditions of adults hospitalized with COVID-19 (N = 305), by age group and race/ethnicity* : eight hospitals, Georgia, March 2020\nCharacteristic	All patients, no.

Case fatality among patients aged 18-49 years, 50-64 years, and &gt;=65 years was 3.4%, 9.8%, and 35.6%, respectively (p&lt;0.001). Black patients were not more likely than were nonblack patients to receive IMV, to die, or to experience the composite outcome of IMV or death (Figure 2). Among patients without high-risk conditions, 22.5% were admitted to the ICU, 15.0% received IMV, and 5.1% died while in the hospital. As of April 24, 2020, 24 (7.9%) patients remained hospitalized, including 14 (58.3%) in the ICU and nine (37.5%) on IMV. Overall, the estimated percentage of deaths among patients who received ICU care ranged from 37.0%, assuming all remaining ICU patients survived, to 48.7%, assuming all remaining ICU patients died. In an adjusted time-to-event analysis of IMV or death as a composite outcome, no significant difference was found between black and nonblack patients (HR = 0.63; 95% CI = 0.35-1.13).\nDiscussion\nThis report characterizing a cohort of hospitalized adults with COVID-19 in Georgia (primarily metropolitan Atlanta) found that most patients in the cohort were black, and black patients had a similar probability of receiving IMV or dying during hospitalization compared with nonblack patients. Although a larger proportion of older patients had worse outcomes (IMV or death), a considerable proportion of patients aged 18-64 years who lacked high-risk conditions received ICU-level care and died (23% and 5%, respectively). Estimated case fatality among patients who received ICU care was high (37%-49%) but comparable with that observed in a smaller case series of COVID-19 patients in the state of Washington. Among hospitalized patients, 26% lacked high-risk factors for severe COVID-19, and few patients (7%) lived in institutional settings before admission, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause significant morbidity in relatively young persons without severe underlying medical conditions. Community mitigation recommendations (e.g., social distancing) should be widely instituted, not only to protect older adults and those with underlying medical conditions, but also to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 among persons in the general population who might not consider themselves to be at risk for severe illness.\nThe proportion of hospitalized patients who were black was higher than expected based on overall hospitalizations. At four affiliated hospitals, which accounted for 67% of patients in the cohort, 80% of cohort patients were black compared with 47% of hospitalized patients overall during March 2020 (D. Murphy, personal communication, April 7, 2020). Similarly, COVID-NET, which conducts population-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed COVID-19-associated hospitalizations across 14 sites nationwide,  found that black persons were disproportionately represented among hospitalized patients with COVID-19. It is important to continue ongoing efforts to understand why black persons are disproportionately hospitalized for COVID-19, including the role of social and economic factors (including occupational exposures) in SARS-CoV-2 acquisition risk. It is critical that public health officials ensure that prevention activities prioritize communities and racial groups most affected by COVID-19.\nThe findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, the data are from a convenience sample of hospitalized adult patients in metropolitan Atlanta and southern Georgia, and data collection for this assessment was limited by the intention to conduct the investigation quickly. These patients do not necessarily represent all hospitalized patients with COVID-19 at those hospitals, or within Georgia. Second, patients were not tracked after discharge in this investigation. Finally, race and ethnicity were abstracted from medical records, and methods for recording these categories might have differed across hospitals, which could result in misclassification.\nThis report provides valuable clinical data on a large cohort of hospitalized patients. Although frequency of IMV and fatality did not differ by race, black patients were disproportionately represented among hospitalized patients, reflecting greater severity of COVID-19 among this population. Public officials should consider racial differences among patients affected by COVID-19 when planning prevention activities. Approximately one quarter of patients had no high-risk conditions, and 5% of these patients died, suggesting that all adults, regardless of underlying conditions or age, are at risk for serious COVID-19-associated illness.\nSummary\nWhat is already known about this topic?\nOlder adults and persons with underlying medical conditions are at higher risk for severe COVID-19. Non-Hispanic black patients are overrepresented among hospitalized U.S. COVID-19 patients.\nWhat is added by this report?\nIn a cohort of 305 hospitalized adults with COVID-19 in Georgia (primarily metropolitan Atlanta), black patients were overrepresented, and their clinical outcomes were similar to those of nonblack patients. One in four hospitalized patients had no recognized risk factors for severe COVID-19.\nWhat are the implications for public health practice?\nPrevention activities should prioritize communities and racial groups most affected by severe COVID-19.

in China","abstract":"Background\nSince December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7092819","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical

Extensive Cross-Neutralization between Pandemic and Seasonal A/H1N1 Influenza Viruses Using a Pseudotype Neutralization Assay","abstract":"Background\nCross-immunity between seasonal and pandemic A/H1N1 influenza viruses remains uncertain.\n\n In particular, the extent that previous infection or vaccination by seasonal A/H1N1 viruses can elicit protective immunity against pandemic A/H1N1 is unclear.\n\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nNeutralizing titers against seasonal A/H1N1 (A/Brisbane/59/2007) and against pandemic A/H1N1 (A/California/04/2009) were measured using an HIV-1-based pseudovirus neutralization assay.\n\n Using this highly sensitive assay, we found that a large fraction of subjects who had never been exposed to pandemic A/H1N1 express high levels of pandemic A/H1N1 neutralizing titers.\n\n A significant correlation was seen between neutralization of pandemic A/H1N1 and neutralization of a standard seasonal A/H1N1 strain.\n\n Significantly higher pandemic A/H1N1 neutralizing titers were measured in subjects who had received vaccination against seasonal influenza in 20082009. Higher pandemic neutralizing titers were also measured in subjects over 60 years of age.\n\n\nConclusions/Significance\nOur findings reveal that the extent of protective cross-immunity between seasonal and pandemic A/H1N1 influenza viruses may be more important than previously estimated.\n\n This cross-immunity could provide a possible explanation of the relatively mild profile of the recent influenza pandemic.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2882952","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Batrice","surname":"Labrosse","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mathieu","surname":"Tourdjman","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Raphal","surname":"Porcher","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jrme","surname":"LeGoff","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xavier","surname":"de Lamballerie","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Franois","surname":"Simon","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jean-Michel","surname":"Molina","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Franois","surname":"Clavel","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Linqi","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Linqi","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0009214","date":"2010-01-25","title":"Novel Virus Influenza A (H1N1sw) in South-Eastern France, April-August 2009","abstract":"Background\nIn April 2009, the first cases of pandemic (H1N1)-2009 influenza [H1N1sw] virus were detected in France.\n\n Virological surveillance was undertaken in reference laboratories of the seven French Defence Zones.\n\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nWe report results of virological analyses performed in the Public Hospitals of Marseille during the first months of the outbreak.\n\n (i) Nasal swabs were tested using rapid influenza diagnostic test (RIDT) and two RT-PCR assays.\n\n Epidemiological characteristics of the 99 first suspected cases were analyzed, including detection of influenza virus and 18 other respiratory viruses.\n\n During three months, a total of 1,815 patients were tested (including 236 patients infected H1N1sw virus) and distribution in age groups and results of RIDT were analyzed.\n\n (ii) 600 sera received before April 2009 and randomly selected from in-patients were tested by a standard hemagglutination inhibition assay for antibody to the novel H1N1sw virus.\n\n (iii) One early (May 2009) and one late (July 2009) viral isolates were characterized by sequencing the complete hemagglutinine and neuraminidase genes.\n\n (iiii) Epidemiological characteristics of a cluster of cases that occurred in July 2009 in a summer camp were analyzed.\n\n\nConclusions/Significance\nThis study presents new virological and epidemiological data regarding infection by the pandemic A/H1N1 virus in Europe.\n\n Distribution in age groups was found to be similar to that previously reported for seasonal H1N1. The first seroprevalence data made available for a European population suggest a previous exposure of individuals over 40 years old to influenza viruses antigenically related to the pandemic (H1N1)-2009 virus.\n\n Genomic analysis indicates that strains harbouring a new amino-acid pattern in the neuraminidase gene appeared secondarily and tended to supplant the first strains.\n\n Finally, in contrast with previous reports, our data support the use of RIDT for the detection of infection in children, especially in the context of the investigation of grouped cases.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2822845","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

including hand washing and use of hand sanitizer, have been recommended to mitigate the transmission of influenza, but limited information is available regarding schools' ability to implement these NPIs during an influenza outbreak.\n\n We evaluated implementation of NPIs during fall 2009 in response to H1N1 pandemic influenza (pH1N1) by New York City (NYC) public schools.\n\n\nMethods\nFrom January 25 through February 9, 2010, an online survey was sent to all the 1,632 NYC public schools and principals were asked to participate in the survey or to designate a school nurse or other school official with knowledge of school policies and characteristics to do so.\n\n\nResults\nOf 1,633 schools, 376(23%) accessed and completed the survey.\n\n Nearly all respondents (99%) implemented at least two NPIs.\n\n Schools that had a Flu Response Team (FRT) as a part of school emergency preparedness plan were more likely to implement the NPI guidelines recommended by NYC public health officials than schools that did not have a FRT.\n\n Designation of a room for isolating ill students, for example, was more common in schools with a FRT (72%) than those without (53%) (p&lt;0.001).\n\n\nConclusions\nImplementing an NPI program in a large school system to mitigate the effects of an influenza outbreak is feasible, but there is potential need for additional resources in some schools to increase capacity and adherence to all recommendations.\n\n Public health influenza-preparedness plans should include school preparedness planning and FRTs.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3546112","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Simon

systems improvement analysis","abstract":"Background\nSchool closure was employed as a non-pharmaceutical intervention against pandemic 2009 H1N1, particularly during the first wave.\n\n More than 700 schools in the United States were closed.\n\n However, closure decisions reflected significant variation in rationales, decision triggers, and authority for closure.\n\n This variability presents the opportunity for improved efficiency and decision-making.\n\n\nMethods\nWe identified media reports relating to school closure as a response to 2009 H1N1 by monitoring high-profile sources and searching Lexis-Nexis and Google news alerts, and reviewed reports for key themes.\n\n News stories were supplemented by observing conference calls and meetings with health department and school officials, and by discussions with decision-makers and community members.\n\n\nResults\nThere was significant variation in the stated goal of closure decision, including limiting community spread of the virus, protecting particularly vulnerable students, and responding to staff shortages or student absenteeism.\n\n Because the goal of closure is relevant to its timing, nature, and duration, unclear rationales for closure can challenge its effectiveness.\n\n There was also significant variation in the decision-making authority to close schools in different jurisdictions, which, in some instances, was reflected in open disagreement between school and public health officials.\n\n Finally, decision-makers did not appear to expect the level of scientific uncertainty encountered early in the pandemic, and they often expressed significant frustration over changing CDC guidance.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe use of school closure as a public health response to epidemic disease can be improved by ensuring that officials clarify the goals of closure and tailor closure decisions to those goals.\n\n Additionally, authority to close schools should be clarified in advance, and decision-makers should expect to encounter uncertainty disease emergencies unfold and plan accordingly.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3039590","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

functions for identifying threats to the health of a community.\n\n Very little is known about how these functions are conducted at the local level.\n\n The purpose of the Epidemiology Networks in Action (EpiNet) Study was to describe the epidemiology and surveillance response to the 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) by city and county health departments in the San Francisco Bay Area in California.\n\n The study also documented lessons learned from the response in order to strengthen future public health preparedness and response planning efforts in the region.\n\n\nMethods\nIn order to characterize the epidemiology and surveillance response, we conducted key informant interviews with public health professionals from twelve local health departments in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\n In order to contextualize aspects of organizational response and performance, we recruited two types of key informants: public health professionals who were involved with the epidemiology and surveillance response for each jurisdiction, as well as the health officer or his/her designee responsible for H1N1 response activities.\n\n Information about the organization, data sources for situation awareness, decision-making, and issues related to surge capacity, continuity of operations, and sustainability were collected during the key informant interviews.\n\n Content and interpretive analyses were conducted using ATLAS.\n\nti software.\n\n\nResults\nThe study found that disease investigations were important in the first months of the pandemic, often requiring additional staff support and sometimes forcing other public health activities to be put on hold.\n\n We also found that while the Incident Command System (ICS) was used by all participating agencies to manage the response, the manner in which it was implemented and utilized varied.\n\n Each local health department (LHD) in the study collected epidemiologic data from a variety of sources, but only case reports (including hospitalized and fatal cases) and laboratory testing data were used by all organizations.\n\n While almost every LHD attempted to collect school absenteeism data, many respondents reported problems in collecting and analyzing these data.\n\n Laboratory capacity to test influenza specimens often aided an LHDs ability to conduct disease investigations and implement control measures, but the ability to test specimens varied across the region and even well-equipped laboratories exceeded their capacity.\n\n As a whole, the health jurisdictions in the region communicated regularly about key decision-making (continued on next page) (continued from previous page) related to the response, and prior regional collaboration on pandemic influenza planning helped to prepare the region for the novel H1N1 influenza pandemic.\n\n The study did find, however, that many respondents (including the majority of epidemiologists interviewed) desired an increase in regional communication about epidemiology and surveillance issues.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe study collected information about the epidemiology and surveillance response among LHDs in the San Francisco Bay Area that has implications for public health preparedness and emergency response training, public health best practices, regional public health collaboration, and a perceived need for information sharing.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3681650","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Wayne

variations in legal authority and plan criteria can alter the impact","abstract":"Background\nStates pandemic influenza plans and school closure statutes are intended to guide state and local officials, but most faced a great deal of uncertainty during the 2009 influenza H1N1 epidemic.\n\n Questions remained about whether, when, and for how long to close schools and about which agencies and officials had legal authority over school closures.\n\n\nMethods\nThis study began with analysis of states school-closure statutes and pandemic influenza plans to identify the variations among them.\n\n An agent-based model of one state was used to represent as constants a populations demographics, commuting patterns, work and school attendance, and community mixing patterns while repeated simulations explored the effects of variations in school closure authority, duration, closure thresholds, and reopening criteria.\n\n\nResults\nThe results show no basis on which to justify statewide rather than school-specific or community-specific authority for school closures.\n\n Nor do these simulations offer evidence to require school closures promptly at the earliest stage of an epidemic.\n\n More important are criteria based on monitoring of local case incidence and on authority to sustain closure periods sufficiently to achieve epidemic mitigation.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis agent-based simulation suggests several ways to improve statutes and influenza plans.\n\n First, school closure should remain available to state and local authorities as an influenza mitigation strategy.\n\n Second, influenza plans need not necessarily specify the threshold for school closures but should clearly define provisions for early and ongoing local monitoring.\n\n Finally, school closure authority may be exercised at the statewide or local level, so long as decisions are informed by monitoring incidence in local communities and schools.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3532840","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Margaret

sanitizer interventions have been shown to be effective in reducing illness-related absences.\n\n However, while the importance of hand hygiene in schools is clear, the role of instruction in use is less obvious.\n\n The purpose of this study was to compare absenteeism rates among elementary students given access to hand hygiene facilities versus students given both access and short repetitive instruction in use, particularly during influenza season when illness-related absences are at a peak.\n\n\nMethods\nA hand hygiene intervention was implemented from October to May during the 2009/2010 academic year, including peak flu season, in two Chicago Public Elementary Schools among students grades pre-kindergarten to eighth grade (ages 414).\n\n Classrooms were systematically assigned to an intervention or control group by grade (cluster design).\n\n Hand hygiene facilities (sanitizer and soap) were made available to all students.\n\n Students in the intervention group also received short repetitive instruction in hand hygiene every 2 months.\n\n Only absences as a result of respiratory or gastrointestinal illness were used to establish illness-related absenteeism rates.\n\n Percent absent days were calculated and bivariate analyses were performed to compare percent absent days among students given access to hand hygiene facilities versus students given both access and instruction.\n\n Prior to the intervention, teachers perceptions of students hand hygiene were also evaluated.\n\n Teacher perceptions were analysed to describe attitudes and beliefs.\n\n\nResults\nData were collected and analysed for 773 students reporting 1,886 absences during the study period (1.73% of total school days).\n\n Both the percent total absent days and percent illness-related absent days were significantly lower in the group receiving short instruction during flu season (P?=?0.002, P?&lt;?0.001, respectively).\n\n This difference peaked during the influenza season (when intervention began) and declined in the following months.\n\n Teachers (n?=?23) agreed that hand hygiene is not performed properly among students and reported time constraints as a barrier to frequent hand washing.\n\n\nConclusions\nAdding hand hygiene instruction to existing hand hygiene practices improved attendance at public elementary schools during the flu season.\n\n Standardized and brief repetitive instruction in hand hygiene holds potential to significantly reduce absenteeism.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3470997","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

disease is increasingly used to help guide public health policy.\n\n As directly transmitted infections, such as influenza and tuberculosis, require contact between individuals, knowledge about contact patterns is a necessary pre-requisite of accurate model predictions.\n\n Of particular interest is the potential impact of school closure as a means of controlling pandemic influenza (and potentially other pathogens).\n\n\nMethods\nThis paper uses a population-based prospective survey of mixing patterns in eight European countries to study the relative change in the basic reproduction number (R0 - the average number of secondary cases from a typical primary case in a fully susceptible population) on weekdays versus weekends and during regular versus holiday periods.\n\n The relative change in R0 during holiday periods and weekends gives an indication of the impact collective school closures (and prophylactic absenteeism) may have during a pandemic.\n\n\nResults\nSocial contact patterns differ substantially when comparing weekdays to the weekend and regular to holiday periods mainly due to the reduction in work and/or school contacts.\n\n For most countries the basic reproduction number decreases from the week to weekends and regular to holiday periods by about 21% and 17%, respectively.\n\n However for other countries no significant decrease was observed.\n\n\nConclusion\nWe use a large-scale social contact survey in eight different European countries to gain insights in the relative change in the basic reproduction number on weekdays versus weekends and during regular versus holiday periods.\n\n The resulting estimates indicate that school closure can have a substantial impact on the spread of a newly emerging infectious disease that is

A standard form was used to abstract information from relevant articles identified from six medical, behavioral and social science literature databases.\n\n We also analyzed data from the National Outbreaks Reporting System (NORS), maintained by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention since 2009, to estimate the frequency of mass gathering-related respiratory disease outbreaks reported to the system.\n\n\nResults\nWe identified 21 published articles describing 72 mass gathering-related respiratory disease outbreaks.\n\n Of these 72, 40 (56%) were associated with agriculture fairs and Influenza A H3N2v following probable swine exposure, and 25 (35%) with youth summer camps and pandemic Influenza A H1N1. Outbreaks of measles (n = 1) and mumps (n = 2) were linked to the international importation of disease.\n\n Between 2009 and 2013, 1,114 outbreaks were reported to NORS, including 96 respiratory disease outbreaks due to Legionella.\n\n None of these legionellosis outbreaks was linked to a mass gathering according to available data.\n\n\nConclusion\nMass gathering-related respiratory disease outbreaks may be uncommon in the United States, but have been reported from fairs (zoonotic transmission) as well as at camps where participants have close social contact in communal housing.\n\n International importation can also be a contributing factor.\n\n NORS collects information on certain respiratory diseases and could serve as a platform to monitor mass gathering-related respiratory outbreaks in the future.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4990208","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Jeanette

impact of mass gatherings and holiday traveling on the course of an influenza pandemic: a computational model","abstract":"Background\nDuring the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, concerns arose about the potential negative effects of mass public gatherings and travel on the course of the pandemic.\n\n Better understanding the potential effects of temporal changes in social mixing patterns could help public officials determine if and when to cancel large public gatherings or enforce regional travel restrictions, advisories, or surveillance during an epidemic.\n\n\nMethods\nWe develop a computer simulation model using detailed data from the state of Georgia to explore how various changes in social mixing and contact patterns, representing mass gatherings and holiday traveling, may affect the course of an influenza pandemic.\n\n Various scenarios with different combinations of the length of the mass gatherings or traveling period (range: 0.5 to 5 days), the proportion of the population attending the mass gathering events or on travel (range: 1% to 50%), and the initial reproduction numbers R0 (1.3, 1.5, 1.8) are explored.\n\n\nResults\nMass gatherings that occur within 10 days before the epidemic peak can result in as high as a 10% relative increase in the peak prevalence and the total attack rate, and may have even worse impacts on local communities and travelers' families.\n\n Holiday traveling can lead to a second epidemic peak under certain scenarios.\n\n Conversely, mass traveling or gatherings may have little effect when occurring much earlier or later than the epidemic peak, e.\n\ng.\n\n, more than 40 days earlier or 20 days later than the peak when the initial R0 = 1.5.\nConclusions\nOur results suggest that monitoring, postponing, or cancelling large public gatherings may be warranted close to the epidemic peak but not earlier or later during the epidemic.\n\n Influenza activity should also be closely monitored for a potential second peak if holiday traveling occurs when prevalence is high.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3022852","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

gathering and globalization of respiratory pathogens during the 2013 Hajj","abstract":"Every year, more than 10 million pilgrims arrive in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for the Hajj or Umrah.\n Crowding conditions lead to high rates of respiratory infections among the pilgrims, representing a significant cause of morbidity and a major cause of hospitalization.\n Pre- and post-Hajj nasal specimens were prospectively obtained from a paired cohort (692 pilgrims) and from nonpaired cohorts (514 arriving and 470 departing pilgrims) from 13 countries.\n The countries of residence included Africa (44.2%), Asia (40.2%), the United States (8.4%) and Europe (7.2%).\n Nasal specimens were tested for 34 respiratory pathogens using RT-PCR.\n A total of 80 512 PCRs were performed.\n The prevalence of viruses and bacteria increased, from 7.4% and 15.4% before the Hajj to 45.4% and 31.0% after the Hajj, respectively, due to the acquisition of rhinovirus, coronaviruses (229E, HKU1, OC43), influenza A H1N1, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus.\n We did not identify Middle East respiratory coronavirus carriage.\n At arrival, the prevalence of several viruses was clearly dependent on the pilgrim's country of origin.\n After Hajj participation, these viruses were isolated among pilgrims from all countries, with few exceptions.\n No significant differences were observed between paired and nonpaired cohort results.\n Our results strongly suggest that, given the particularly crowded conditions during the rituals, an international mass gathering such as the Hajj may contribute to the globalization of respiratory pathogens after the cross-contamination of pilgrims harbouring pathogens that easily spread among participants.\n Influenza and pneumococcal vaccination, face mask use and hand hygiene should be considered in the context of the Hajj.\n","id":"PMC7129181","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"European Society of Clinical

In the state of Michigan in particular, there have been 64,998 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 5,943 deaths as of June 11, 2020, which makes Michigan one of the most affected states in the US. While Blacks/African-Americans represent 14% of the Michigan population, they account for 31% of COVID-19 cases and 40% of deaths attributed to COVID-19. Similar trends are observed in New York and Illinois, where there is an overrepresentation of African-Americans and Latinos in COVID-19 cases and deaths.\nOverrepresentation of minority populations in poorer COVID-19 outcomes may be explained by a myriad of factors, such as by weathering, or early health deterioration due to cumulative impact of socioeconomic disparity , higher comorbidity burden, inadequate healthcare, and socioeconomic differences related to unemployment, food insecurity, and housing instability. Several studies have reported non-White, male, older age, current smoking, and comorbid conditions as high risk factors of COVID-19 susceptibility and hospitalization. Racial/ethnic minorities who maintain livelihood as essential workers are more likely to be exposed to the virus, whereas living in high density areas, high proportion of homelessness and incarceration adds to the barriers to social distancing.\nAlthough studies had reported many possible reasons for the overrepresentation of minority populations in poorer health outcomes, the evidence supporting the observed disparity in COVID-19 outcomes remains limited, and more data from diverse communities need to be analyzed. In addition, experiences from COVID-19 highlight the need to not only identify risk factors but also to avoid spurious conclusions of racial/ethnic differences being explained by biology, which could further perpetuate racial/ethnic stereotypes. Data on holistic clinical and sociodemographic factors contributing to racial/ethnic differences in COVID-19 outcomes is limited. Some previous studies have also compared those who tested positive for COVID-19 to those who are negative, instead of population-based controls where selection bias is potentially observed.\nThe objective of this study is to determine sociodemographic and comorbid conditions that are associated with COVID-19 outcomes (e.g., testing positive, hospitalization, admission to ICU, and mortality), utilizing electronic health records (EHR) from the University of Michigan, which serves a large patient population in the US Midwest.\nSubjects and Methods\nEvaluation cohorts\nCOVID-19 cohort:\nWe extracted the EHR data for patients tested for COVID-19 at the University of Michigan Medicine Health System, also known as Michigan Medicine (MM), from March 10, 2020 to April 22, 2020. Our study cohort of 5,698 patients comprises 5,500 patients (96.5%) who were tested at MM and 198 patients (3.5%) who were treated for COVID-19 in MM but tested elsewhere, of which 1,119 were COVID-19 positive. For ease of notation, we refer to them as the tested cohort (n=5,698) and the positive cohort (n=1,119). The tested cohort is a non-random sample of the population, since the testing protocol at MM focused on prioritized testing (e.g., testing symptomatic patients and those at the highest risk of exposure). This cohort also contained transfer patients from other hospitals.\nControl selection:\nTo understand how selection bias factored into our sample, in addition to comparing COVID-19 positive patients with those testing negative, we created two sets of controls from the MM database. The first unmatched control group (n=7,211) is a similar-sized random sample of contemporaneous patients. The second 1:3 frequency-matched control group (n=13,351) is matched by race, sex and age (above or below 50). All controls were alive at the time of data extraction. Study protocols were reviewed and approved by the University of Michigan Medical School Institutional Review Board (IRB ID HUM00180294 and HUM00155849).\nDescription of variables:\nA summary data dictionary, eTable S2A, is available in Supplement with source and definition of each variable used in our analysis.\nCOVID-19 prognosis outcomes:\nAmong the patients diagnosed with COVID-19, we considered various stages of progression of the disease that included hospitalization, admission to the ICU and death. Hospitalizations were defined by inpatients with a COVID-19 diagnosis where the admission date was within the time frame of the data extraction. ICU patients were defined as patients who were admitted to ICU units any time during their COVID-19 related hospitalization. Mortality data including inpatient and non-hospitalized deaths was extracted from EHR.\nClassifying patients who were still in hospital and ICU:\nWe categorized patients into non-hospitalized, hospitalized (includes ICU stays), and hospitalized with ICU stay based on the admission and discharge data. Several patients were still admitted in the hospital (non-ICU, n=53) or were still in an ICU (n=113) at the time of the data extraction. We performed a sensitivity analysis by excluding these patients whose final prognostic outcome is unclear from the analysis (eTable S4 in Supplement).\nGeneration of comorbidities from electronic health records\nWe constructed the comorbid conditions using available International Classification of Diseases (ICD; ninth and tenth editions) code for 23,769 individuals (ntested: 5,225, nunmatched: 6,811, nmatched: 11,733) from EHR. Longitudinal time-stamped diagnoses were recoded to indicator variables for whether a patient ever had a given diagnosis code recorded by MM. To differentiate pre-existing conditions from diagnoses related to COVID-19 testing/treatment, we applied a 14-day-prior restriction on the tested cohort by removing diagnoses that first appeared within the 14 days before the first test or diagnosis date, whichever was earlier (4,622 of the 5,225 tested individuals had diagnoses data after the 14-day-prior restriction). We focused on seven binary disease indicators that have been specifically mentioned in relation to COVID-19 outcomes: respiratory, circulatory, any cancer, type II diabetes, kidney, liver, and autoimmune diseases (ICD codes in eTable S2A in Supplement). We calculated a comorbidity score as the sum of these seven that ranges from 0-7. For exploratory analysis, we defined prior medication use as at least one appearance of a given class of medication in the patient's EHR.\nDefining race/ethnicity groups, SES and other adjustment covariates:\nVariables such as self-reported sex, race/ethnicity, smoking status, alcohol consumption, body mass index (BMI), and age were extracted from the EHR. We classified a patient to be seeking primary care in MM if they have had an encounter in any of the primary care locations in MM since January 1, 2018. Measures of socioeconomic characteristics are defined by US census tract (based on residential address available in each patient's EHR) for the year 2010. The boundaries for the census tracts were normalized to 2010 tract boundaries using the Longitudinal Tract Data Base . We chose three SES indicators included in the National Neighborhood Data Archive (NaNDA): percentage of population with below high school (&lt;HS) education, percentage unemployed and percentage with annual income below federal poverty level (FPL). We also used population density per square mile as a potential predictor.\nStatistical analysis\nSince all outcomes were binary, we performed logistic regression to assess the risk factors of COVID-19 outcomes, by reporting Firth bias-corrected estimate of the odds ratio to address potential separation issues, as well as 95% Wald-type confidence interval and P-value. Continuous predictors were standardized before modeling. Three sets of adjustment covariates were used to check the robustness of inference to the choice of potential confounders: (i) age, race/ethnicity, sex, (ii) adjustment (i)+SES, and (iii) adjustment (ii)+comorbidity score. We present the results of adjustment (ii) in the main text, since adjustment (iii) led to loss of sample size as many of the patients did not have EHR data to construct the pre-existing conditions. Sensitivity analysis after removing those still in ICU or hospital at the time of data extraction were also performed (eTable S4 in Supplement).\nPredictors of being tested: comparing the tested cohort with those who were not tested for COVID-19 (unmatched controls).\nPredictors of COVID-19 susceptibility: comparing the positive cohort with those who were not diagnosed with COVID-19 (unmatched controls)\nPredictors of three COVID-19 prognostic outcomes: among the positive cohort, (i) comparing those who were hospitalized with those who were not, (ii) those who were admitted to ICU with those who were not, and (iii) those who died with those who did not. (this analysis does not use untested controls)\nThree different types of association models were created (eTable S2B in Supplement):  \nAfter analyzing the full cohort including all races, we carried out association analysis stratified by race/ethnicity (NHW or NHAA, given limited sample size for other racial/ethnic groups). Frequency-matched, instead of unmatched controls, were used to assess the COVID-19 susceptibility as the proportion of race/ethnicity in unmatched controls are not comparable to the stratified study population.\nAnalyses were performed in R version 3.6.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing). Statistical significance was defined using a 2-sided significance level of alpha = .05. All unadjusted models and results using other adjustments can be found in eTable S3A for all cohort, S3B and S3C for race/ethnicity-stratified in Supplement.\nResults\nDescriptive Statistics\nA total of 5,698 patients were tested for COVID-19 (median age, 47 years [IQR, 31]; 38% male [2030/5336]; mean BMI 30.1 [SD, 8.1]), among whom 1,119 (19.6%) tested positive (Table 1). Over half of the tested (3,026, 53.1%) had primary care at MM. A majority of those tested were either NHW (3,374, 59.2%) or NHAA (981, 17.2%). Among the 1,119 positive patients, 44.8% (501) were hospitalized, 20.6% (231) were in an ICU, and 3.8% (43) died. As the disease progressed among patients testing positive (from non-hospitalized to hospitalized, ICU, and deceased), the proportion of older age (65 and above), male sex, and ever-smoker, consistently increased (Table 1). BMI showed an increasing trend from non-hospitalized to hospitalized and ICU but not in those who died (pairwise comparison results in eTable S1B in Supplement).\nThe descriptive trends of all three residential SES variables indicate lower SES is associated with poorer COVID outcomes (Table 1). Both the tested cohort and the positive cohort had a higher enrichment of diseases. In particular, type II diabetes and kidney diseases were more common in groups with more severe outcomes. The tested population were also more frequent users of medication (e.g. NSAIDs, statins, and anticoagulants) compared with the unmatched controls (eTable S1A in Supplement).\nDescriptive statistics stratified by NHW and NHAA (eTable S1A and S1B in Supplement) show a stark contrast in COVID-19 outcomes across these two groups that we capture in Figure 1. The test-positive rate was significantly higher in NHAA compared with NHW (42.6% vs. 13.7%, P&lt;.001), hospital admission (52.2% vs. 39%, P&lt;.001), ICU (27% vs. 14.8%, P&lt;.001), and death (5.3% vs. 3.0%, P=.12). Moreover, racial disparities also exist across demographics such as BMI, lower SES, and comorbidity conditions, which were consistently more prevalent in NHAA compared with NHW across subpopulations defined by COVID-19 outcomes (pairwise P&lt;.001, eTable S1C in Supplement).\nAssociation Analysis of COVID-19 Outcomes Using Multivariable Logistic Regression\nFactors Associated with Getting Tested\nDue to dependence on test availability, the testing guidelines varied during the time of the study. Comparing with the random controls from MM, overall, we noticed that male sex, current smoking, percentage of population with &lt;HS education and percentage below FPL were inversely associated with the chance of getting tested whereas NHAA race/ethnicity, past smoking, age, BMI, and all comorbidities were positively associated with getting tested (eTable S5 in Supplement).\nFactors Associated with being Positive or with COVID19 Susceptibility\nFull cohort:\nWe identified the following factors that differed between testing positive for COVID-19 and the randomly selected untested population from MM: NHAA vs NHW odds ratio (OR) was 7.11 (95% CI, 5.71-8.87; P&lt;.001); older age (OR, 1.66 [95% CI, 1.52-1.82]; P&lt;.001), higher BMI (OR, 1.35 [95% CI, 1.23-1.47]; P&lt;.001), and alcohol consumption (ever vs. never; OR, 1.42 [95% CI, 1.17-1.73]; P&lt;.001) (Table 2). Current smoking (self-reported in the latest EHR record) was observed as being protective against COVID-19 outcomes (OR, 0.34 [95% CI, 0.22-0.51]; P&lt;.001), with a positive but insignificant association with past smoking (possibly due to quitting smoking for health reasons). In addition, population density was associated with testing positive (OR, 1.46 [95% CI, 1.33, 1.60]; P&lt;.001). Percentage with income below FPL showed consistent association in protective direction, perhaps due to high correlation and overlap with other SES variables. Table 2 indicates that pre-existing comorbidities were associated with testing positive. Conversely, a comparison between those who testing positive versus those testing negative showed protective effects of existing comorbidity conditions, a reflection of the bias due to targeted testing criteria.\nRace/ethnicity-stratified:\nFormer smokers were strongly associated with testing positive in both NHW (OR, 1.54 [95% CI, 1.22-1.95]; P&lt;.001) and NHAA (OR, 1.74 [95% CI, 1.25-2.42]; P=.001). Overweight/obesity and having any cancer showed stronger effect in the race-stratified analysis, especially obesity in NHAA (OR, 6.15 [95% CI, 3.50-10.82]; P&lt;.001). The stronger association was most likely due to stratification which addresses potential presence of interaction by race. All comorbidities and SES variables show similar directionalities as the full cohort.\nFactors Associated with Prognosis among COVID-19 Diagnosed Patients\nFull Cohort:\nAmong the COVID-19 positive cohort, NHAA were 1.66 (95% CI, 1.09-2.52; P=.02) times more likely to be hospitalized, 1.52 (95% CI, 0.92-2.52; P=.1) times more likely of ICU admission, and 1.17 (95% CI, 0.4-3.45; P=.77) times more likely of death than NHW (Table 3), shown in Figure 1. Higher population density was associated with higher chance of hospitalization (OR, 1.27 [95% CI, 1.20-1.76]; P=.02), whereas older age, male sex and obesity consistently showed strong association with poor prognosis (Table 3). Type II diabetes (OR, 1.62 [95% CI 1.09-2.41]; P=.02) and kidney disease (OR, 2.55 [95% CI, 1.62-4.02]; P&lt;.001) stood out as the strongest risk factors of hospitalization amongst the seven comorbidities. In spite of limited power due to sample size when comparing deceased versus alive, composite comorbidity score (OR, 1.72 [95%CI, 1.08-2.75]; P=.02) and kidney disease (OR, 2.82 [95%CI, 1.09-7.28]; P=.03) appear to be the strongest risk factors, in addition to age and male sex.\nRace/ethnicity-stratified:\nIn NHW, patients with obesity and type II diabetes were 2.89 (95% CI, 1.31-6.35; P=.009) and 2.53 (95% CI, 1.41-4.57; P=.002) times more likely to be hospitalized compared to those without, respectively. In NHAA, males were at higher risk of being hospitalized (OR, 2.96 [95% CI, 1.68-5.2]; P&lt;.001) than females, as well as being admitted to ICU (OR, 2.65 [95% CI, 1.37-5.11]; P=.004). In general, in addition to older age, patients with pre-existing kidney diseases had worse prognosis, especially for mortality in NHAA (OR, 11.9 [95% CI, 2.2-43.5]; P=.004).\nDiscussion\nThis is one of the first studies to compare patient neighborhood SES, sociodemographic factors and health conditions from EHR data to uncover potential risk factors for observed racial disparities in COVID-19 susceptibility and prognosis. We identified racial and socioeconomic disparity in all COVID-19 outcomes (statistically significant for testing positive, hospitalization and suggestive for ICU admission and mortality due to small sample size). Pre-existing health conditions, and higher comorbidity burden were associated with poor prognosis.\nThis work contributes to a new area of COVID-19 research that incorporates both EHR data and SES data to rigorously examine racial/ethnic differences in disease susceptibility and prognosis. Other novel contributions include: (i) we compare the COVID-19 tested positive population with a random subset of the MM population to avoid the biased sample of who gets tested for COVID-19. (ii) We consider outcomes related to both susceptibility and prognosis. (iii) While most of the early studies present unadjusted analysis of various risk factors, we present a comprehensive analytic framework that attempts to adjust for an expanded set of potential confounders with suitably chosen comparison groups.\nIn general, our findings are consistent with existing studies. The observed high prevalence of kidney disease in COVID-19 mortality in NHAA can be possibly explained by the racial/ethnic differences in kidney disease; males were at a higher risk of hospitalization and death, especially among those 50 years and older; health conditions such as obesity, cancer, diabetes mellitus and renal conditions were prevalent in severe prognosis of COVID-19. Notably, our findings largely agree with another recently published work looking at racial/ethnic differences in COVID-19 outcomes in an integrated-delivery health system in Louisiana, which did not identify type II diabetes and kidney disease as risk factors of hospitalization as we do. Similar directional results but different strength of association with SES variables is likely because we used a continuous metric as opposed to the categorical measures used in Price-Haywood et al.\nDue to the prioritized testing scenario, there may be many asymptomatic or mild-symptomatic patients in the control population. Therefore, the comparison results between the positive and the unmatched control reveals the fact that in general, people with low SES and pre-existing health conditions had higher risk of developing severe disease outcomes after being infected with COVID-19. In contrast, a naive comparison between the positive and the negative in the tested population leads to counterintuitive findings (protective effect of smoking, medication use, and worse comorbidity condition) contradicting findings in other COVID-19 studies. This amplifies the need for choosing an appropriate control group.\nThis study has several limitations. First, we may not have captured all hospitalized patients given that only about half (48.3%) of the positive cohort had primary care at MM. It is possible that some of the &quot;not hospitalized&quot; patients actually were hospitalized elsewhere. Second, we did not consider the transfer patients from other hospitals as a special sub-group, who often had more severe outcomes. Third, early in COVID-19 course at MM, all COVID-19 patients were placed in regional infectious containment unit (RICU), some of which did not require ICU-level care. We suggest future study to define ICU patients using requirement of mechanical ventilators. Fourth, one may argue that the untested MM controls are intrinsically different than the tested cohort and do not serve as proper controls and may impact the estimation of the ORs observed in the susceptibility models. In the future, when testing is abundantly available, we may be able to restrict the patient population only to the catchment of MM or those who seek primary care at MM and exclude transfer patients. However, this is only a limitation in susceptibility models, and, the prognosis-outcome models only focused on the tested positive cohort and did not use the untested controls and thus, are not subject to the same selection issues. Lastly, the study results should be interpreted cautiously for generalizability given the demographics varies by region and by countries.\nConclusion\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has reached every corner of the globe affecting millions and tens of millions of their loved ones. Our findings highlight that COVID-19 disproportionately affects those who are vulnerable: the elderly, those with pre-existing conditions, and those in population dense communities. Specifically, NHAAs have a greater risk burden - more likely to test positive, more likely to be hospitalized and more likely to be admitted to the ICU. Our results support targeted screening for the elderly and those with type II diabetes and kidney disease. Moreover, we call for increased investments in testing and prevention efforts in low SES, densely populated communities and racially diverse communities. It is these same communities that employ a greater proportion of essential workers who have been rightly called heroes but have still not been treated and protected as such. Genetics could also play a role in determining susceptibility and prognosis. Thus, it is important to expand this study to consider the multifactorial interplay of genetics and environment in the future.\nSupplementary Material\nReferences\nRacial and Ethnic Disparities in SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic: Analysis of a COVID-19 Observational Registry for a Diverse U.S. Metropolitan Population\nRace, Socioeconomic Deprivation, and Hospitalization for COVID-19 in English participants of a National Biobank\nUnequal Distribution of COVID-19 Risk among Rural Residents by Race and Ethnicity\nMultivariate Analysis of Factors Affecting COVID-19 Case and Death Rate in U.S. Counties: The Significant Effects of Black Race and Temperature\nRacial and Ethnic Disparities in Population Level Covid-19 Mortality\nRacial, Economic and Health Inequality and COVID-19 Infection in the United States\nCOVID-19 and Racial Disparities\nDisparities In Outcomes Among COVID-19 Patients In A Large Health Care System In California\nCharacteristics and Outcomes of COVID-19 Patients in New York City's Public Hospital System\nComprehensive Testing Highlights Racial, Ethnic, and Age Disparities in the COVID-19 Outbreak\nAssessing Differential Impacts of COVID-19 on Black Communities\nCovid-19 by Race and Ethnicity: A National Cohort Study of 6 Million United States Veterans\nHospitalization and Mortality among Black Patients and White Patients with Covid-19\nThis Time Must Be Different: Disparities During the COVID-19 Pandemic\nRacial Health Disparities and Covid-19 : Caution and Context\n&quot;Weathering&quot; and Age Patterns of Allostatic Load Scores Among Blacks and Whites in the United States\nAre Clinicians Contributing to Excess African American COVID-19 Deaths?

Adjusting for covariates, non-Hispanic Blacks were 1.66 times more likely to be hospitalized and 1.52 times more likely to be admitted to ICUs than non-Hispanic Whites.\nMeaning:\nTargeted interventions to support vulnerable populations are needed. Racial disparities existed in COVID-19 outcomes that cannot be explained after controlling for age, sex, and socioeconomic status.\n","References depth 1":[{"doi":"10.1101/2020.04.24.20073148","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Racial and Ethnic Disparities in SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic: Analysis of a COVID-19 Observational Registry for a Diverse U.S. Metropolitan Population","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[]},{"doi":"10.1101/2020.04.27.20082107","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Race, Socioeconomic Deprivation, and Hospitalization for COVID-19 in English participants of a National Biobank","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"CDC.

The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7092819","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical

health outcomes.\n\n More information is needed about racial and ethnic differences in outcomes from Covid-19.\nMethods\nIn this retrospective cohort study, we analyzed data from patients seen within an integrated-delivery health system (Ochsner Health) in Louisiana between March 1 and April 11, 2020, who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19) on qualitative polymerase-chain-reaction assay.\n\n The Ochsner Health population is 31% black non-Hispanic and 65% white non-Hispanic.\n\n The primary outcomes were hospitalization and in-hospital death.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 3626 patients tested positive, of whom 145 were excluded (84 had missing data on race or ethnic group, 9 were Hispanic, and 52 were Asian or of another race or ethnic group).\n\n Of the 3481 Covid-19positive patients included in our analyses, 60.0% were female, 70.4% were black non-Hispanic, and 29.6% were white non-Hispanic.\n\n Black patients had higher prevalences of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease than white patients.\n\n A total of 39.7% of Covid-19positive patients (1382 patients) were hospitalized, 76.9% of whom were black.\n\n In multivariable analyses, black race, increasing age, a higher score on the Charlson Comorbidity Index (indicating a greater burden of illness), public insurance (Medicare or Medicaid), residence in a low-income area, and obesity were associated with increased odds of hospital admission.\n\n Among the 326 patients who died from Covid-19, 70.6% were black.\n\n In adjusted time-to-event analyses, variables that were associated with higher in-hospital mortality were increasing age and presentation with an elevated respiratory rate; elevated levels of venous lactate, creatinine, or procalcitonin; or low platelet or lymphocyte counts.\n\n However, black race was not independently associated with higher mortality (hazard ratio for death vs.\n\n white race, 0.89; 95% confidence interval, 0.68 to 1.17).\n\n\nConclusions\nIn a large cohort in Louisiana, 76.9% of the patients who were hospitalized with Covid-19 and 70.6% of those who died were black, whereas blacks comprise only 31% of the Ochsner Health population.\n\n Black race was not associated with higher in-hospital mortality than white race, after adjustment for differences in

ethnicity, and country of birth on a national scale, 20012013: A retrospective cohort (Scottish Health and Ethnicity Linkage Study)","abstract":"Background\nMigrant and ethnic minority groups are often assumed to have poor health relative to the majority population.\n\n Few countries have the capacity to study a key indicator, mortality, by ethnicity and country of birth.\n\n We hypothesized at least 10% differences in mortality by ethnic group in Scotland that would not be wholly attenuated by adjustment for socio-economic factors or country of birth.\n\n\nMethods and findings\nWe linked the Scottish 2001 Census to mortality data (20012013) in 4.62 million people (91% of estimated population), calculating age-adjusted mortality rate ratios (RRs; multiplied by 100 as percentages) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for 13 ethnic groups, with the White Scottish group as reference (ethnic group classification follows the Scottish 2001 Census).\n\n The Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation, education status, and household tenure were socio-economic status (SES) confounding variables and born in the UK or Republic of Ireland (UK/RoI) an interacting and confounding variable.\n\n Smoking and diabetes data were from a primary care sub-sample (about 53,000 people).\n\n Males and females in most minority groups had lower age-adjusted mortality RRs than the White Scottish group.\n\n The 95% CIs provided good evidence that the RR was more than 10% lower in the following ethnic groups: Other White British (72.3 [95% CI 64.2, 81.3] in males and 75.2 [68.0, 83.2] in females); Other White (80.8 [72.8, 89.8] in males and 76.2 [68.6, 84.7] in females); Indian (62.6 [51.6, 76.0] in males and 60.7 [50.4, 73.1] in females); Pakistani (66.1 [57.4, 76.2] in males and 73.8 [63.7, 85.5] in females); Bangladeshi males (50.7 [32.5, 79.1]); Caribbean females (57.5 [38.5, 85.9]); and Chinese (52.2 [43.7, 62.5] in males and 65.8 [55.3, 78.2] in females).\n\n The differences were diminished but not eliminated after adjusting for UK/RoI birth and SES variables.\n\n A mortality advantage was evident in all 12 minority groups for those born abroad, but in only 6/12 male groups and 5/12 female groups of those born in the UK/RoI.\n\n In the primary care sub-sample, after adjustment for age, UK/RoI born, SES, smoking, and diabetes, the RR was not lower in Indian males (114.7 [95% CI 78.3, 167.9]) and Pakistani females (103.9 [73.9, 145.9]) than in White Scottish males and females, respectively.\n\n The main limitations were the inability to include deaths abroad and the small number of deaths in some ethnic minority groups, especially for people born in the UK/RoI.\n\n\nConclusions\nThere was relatively low mortality for many ethnic minority groups compared to the White Scottish majority.\n\n The mortality advantage was less clear in UK/RoI-born minority group offspring than in immigrants.\n\n These differences need explaining, and health-related behaviours seem important.\n\n Similar analyses are required internationally to fulfil agreed goals for monitoring, understanding, and improving health in ethnically diverse societies

1987 and followed them up over 20 years.\n\n The primary outcome was development of multimorbidity (2+ health conditions).\n\n The relationship between five different risk factors (smoking, alcohol consumption, diet, body mass index (BMI), physical activity) and the development of multimorbidity was assessed.\n\n Social patterning in the development of multimorbidity based on two measures of socioeconomic status (area-based deprivation and household income) was then determined, followed by investigation of potential mediation by the five risk factors.\n\n Multilevel logistic regression

management of this disease have published clinical practice guidelines for quality practice.\n\n However, at present, there are important weaknesses in COPD diagnosis criteria that often lead to underdiagnosis or misdiagnosis.\n\n\nObjective\nWe sought to develop a new support system for COPD diagnosis.\n\n The system was designed to overcome the weaknesses detected in current guidelines with the goals of enabling early diagnosis, and improving the diagnostic accuracy and quality of care provided.\n\n\nMethods\nWe first analyzed the main clinical guidelines for COPD to detect weaknesses that exist in the current diagnostic process, and then proposed a redesign based on a business process management (BPM) strategy for its optimization.\n\n The BPM system acts as a backbone throughout the process of COPD diagnosis in this proposed approach.\n\n The newly developed support system was integrated into a health information system for validation of its use in a hospital environment.\n\n The system was qualitatively evaluated by experts (n=12) and patients (n=36).\n\n\nResults\nAmong the 12 experts, 10 (83%) positively evaluated our system with respect to increasing the speed for making the diagnosis, helping in interpreting results, and encouraging opportunistic diagnosis.\n\n With an overall rating of 4.29 on a 5-point scale, 27/36 (75%) of patients considered that the system was very useful in providing a warning about possible cases of COPD.\n\n The overall assessment of the system was 4.53 on a 5-point Likert scale with agreement to extend its use to all primary care centers.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe proposed system provides a functional method to overcome the weaknesses detected in the current diagnostic process for COPD, which can help foster early diagnosis,

2019 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-2019).\n\n\nDesign\nRetrospective case series.\n\n\nSetting\nSeven hospitals in Zhejiang province, China.\n\n\nParticipants\n62 patients admitted to hospital with laboratory confirmed SARS-Cov-2 infection.\n\n Data were collected from 10 January 2020 to 26 January 2020.\nMain outcome measures\nClinical data, collected using a standardised case report form, such as temperature, history of exposure, incubation period.\n\n If information was not clear, the working group in Hangzhou contacted the doctor responsible for treating the patient for clarification.\n\n\nResults\nOf the 62 patients studied (median age 41 years), only one was admitted to an intensive care unit, and no patients died during the study.\n\n According to research, none of the infected patients in Zhejiang province were ever exposed to the Huanan seafood market, the original source of the virus; all studied cases were infected by human to human transmission.\n\n The most common symptoms at onset of illness were fever in 48 (77%) patients, cough in 50 (81%), expectoration in 35 (56%), headache in 21 (34%), myalgia or fatigue in 32 (52%), diarrhoea in 3 (8%), and haemoptysis in 2 (3%).\n\n Only two patients (3%) developed shortness of breath on admission.\n\n The median time from exposure to onset of illness was 4 days (interquartile range 3-5 days), and from onset of symptoms to first hospital admission was 2 (1-4) days.\n\n\nConclusion\nAs of early February 2020, compared with patients initially infected with SARS-Cov-2 in Wuhan, the symptoms of patients in Zhejiang province are relatively mild.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7224340","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BMJ Publishing

disease (COPD) could become epidemic.\n\n An up-to-date nationwide estimation of COPD prevalence in China is needed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did a cross-sectional survey of a nationally representative sample of individuals from mainland China aged 40 years or older.\n\n The primary outcome was COPD, defined according to the 2017 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) lung function criteria.\n\n\nFindings\nBetween Dec 29, 2014, and Dec 31, 2015, 66?752 adults were recruited to the study population.\n\n The estimated standardised prevalence of COPD was 136% (95% CI 120152).\n\n The prevalence of COPD differed significantly between men and women (190%, 95% CI 169212 vs 81%, 6893; p&lt;00001), mainly because of a significant difference in smoking status between men and women (current smokers 582% vs 40%).\n\n The prevalence of COPD differed by geographic region, with the highest prevalence in southwest China (202%, 95% CI 147258) and the lowest in central China (102%, 82122).\n\n Among adults with COPD, 564% (95% CI 537592) had mild disease (GOLD stage I), 363% (343383) had moderate disease (GOLD stage II), 65% (5574) had severe disease (GOLD stage III), and 09% (0611) had very severe disease (GOLD stage IV).\n\n\nInterpretation\nIn a large, nationally representative sample of adults aged 40 years or older, the estimated overall prevalence of COPD in China in 201415 was 136%, indicating that this disease has become a major public-health problem.\n\n Strategies aimed at prevention and treatment of COPD are needed urgently.\n\n\nFunding\nChinese Central

radiologically stratified exacerbations: insights into pneumonia aetiology in COPD","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>COPD patients have increased risk of developing pneumonia, which is associated with poor outcomes.\n\n It can be symptomatically indistinguishable from exacerbations, making diagnosis challenging.\n\n Studies of pneumonia in COPD have focused on hospitalised patients and are not representative of the ambulant COPD population.\n\n Therefore, we sought to determine the incidence and aetiology of acute exacerbation events with evidence of pneumonic radiographic infiltrates in an outpatient COPD cohort.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>One hundred twenty-seven patients with moderate to very severe COPD aged 4285years underwent blood and sputum sampling over one year, at monthly stable visits and within 72h of exacerbation symptom onset.\n\n 343 exacerbations with chest radiographs were included.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>20.1% of exacerbations had pneumonic infiltrates.\n\n Presence of infiltrate was highly seasonal (Winter vs summer OR 3.056, p?=?0.027).\n\n In paired analyses these exacerbation events had greater increases in systemic inflammation.\n\n Bacterial detection rate was higher in the pneumonic group, with Haemophilus influenzae the most common bacteria in both radiological groups.\n\n Viral detection and sputum microbiota did not differ with chest radiograph appearance.\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par4'>In an outpatient COPD cohort, pneumonic infiltrates at exacerbation were common, and associated with more intense inflammation.\n\n Bacterial pathogen detection and lung microbiota were not distinct, suggesting that exacerbations and pneumonia in COPD share common infectious triggers and represent a continuum of severity rather than distinct aetiological events.\n\n\nTrial registration\nid='Par5'>Trial registration Number: NCT01360398.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (10.1186/s12931-018-0842-8) contains

and to summarize the techniques that have been used by health care providers to personalize alarm limits for patients with COPD enrolled on tele-health programs.\n\n\nMethods\nA cross-sectional survey consisting of 15 questions was distributed and advertised to health care professionals worldwide.\n\n Questions were designed to cover five different aspects of tele-health in COPD: purpose of use, equipment type, clinician perceptions, variables monitored, and personalization of alarm limits.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 138 participants completed the survey from 29 different countries.\n\n As high as 59% of the participants had ever used tele-health for COPD, and 33% still provided tele-health services to patients with COPD.\n\n Tele-health was most commonly used for baseline monitoring, with 90% believing it to be effective.\n\n The three most commonly monitored variables were oxygen saturation, heart rate, and the use of rescue medication.\n\n\nConclusion\nTwenty-nine different countries

changed the trend of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the province.\n\n\nMethods\nEpidemiological data were obtained from the websites of China's Bureau of Health and the People's Government of Jiangsu Province and informal online sources from January 22 to February 20, 2020.\nResults\nThe cumulative number of patients in Jiangsu Province (over 79 million people) was 613. The number of daily confirmed new cases reached the inflection point on January 31 with the maximum of 39 cases.\n\n The temporal number of patients peaked from January 29 to February 9.

The geographical distribution of COVID-2019 cases showed that all 13 cites reported confirmed new cases after only five days of the first confirmed new case in Suzhou.\n\n The cases were concentrated in Nanjing, Suzhou, and Xuzhou with a high population density (over eight million people).\n\n The epidemiological features of COVID-2019 cases in Wuxi, Jiangsu showed that seven confirmed cases were tourists from others areas beyond Hubei Province.\n\n The longest incubation period of COVID-2019 was 19 days based on the onset of laboratory-confirmed cases.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe number of daily confirmed new cases in Jiangsu Province peaked around January 31 and then declined.\n\n This result emphasized that wartime control measures, such as putting cities on lockdown to limit population mobility in Jiangsu Province, resulted in dramatic reductions in COVID-19 cases.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7130124","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Ke-wei","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jie","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hua","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiao-long","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qin-fang","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Fei-yu","surname":"Guo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhi-jie","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Cheng","email":"woerseng@126.com","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1093/pubmed/fdaa014","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Investigating regional variation of respiratory infections in a general practice syndromic surveillance system","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Coronavirus (COVID-19) roundup","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30287-5","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Epidemiology and transmission of COVID-19 in 391 cases and 1286 of their close contacts in Shenzhen, China: a retrospective cohort study","abstract":"Background\nRapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China, prompted heightened surveillance in Shenzhen, China.\n\n The resulting data provide a rare opportunity to measure key metrics of disease course, transmission, and the impact of control measures.\n\n\nMethods\nFrom Jan 14 to Feb 12, 2020, the Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention identified 391 SARS-CoV-2 cases and 1286 close contacts.\n\n We compared cases identified through symptomatic surveillance and contact tracing, and estimated the time from symptom onset to confirmation, isolation, and admission to hospital.\n\n We estimated metrics of disease transmission and analysed factors influencing transmission risk.\n\n\nFindings\nCases were older than the general population (mean age 45 years) and balanced between males (n=187) and females (n=204).\n\n 356 (91%) of 391 cases had mild or moderate clinical severity at initial assessment.\n\n As of Feb 22, 2020, three cases had died and 225 had recovered (median time to recovery 21 days; 95% CI 2022).\n\n Cases were isolated on average 46 days (95% CI 4150) after developing symptoms; contact tracing reduced this by 19 days (95% CI 1127).\n\n Household contacts and those travelling with a case were at higher risk of infection (odds ratio 627 [95% CI 1492633] for household contacts and 706 [1433491] for those travelling with a case) than other close contacts.\n\n The household secondary attack rate was 112% (95% CI 91138), and children were as likely to be infected as adults (infection rate 74% in children &lt;10 years vs population average of 66%).\n\n The observed reproductive number (R) was 04 (95% CI 0305), with a mean serial interval of 63 days (95% CI 5276).\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur data on cases as well as their infected and uninfected close contacts provide key insights into the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. This analysis shows that isolation and contact tracing reduce the time during which cases are infectious in the community, thereby reducing the R.\n\n The overall impact of isolation and contact tracing, however, is uncertain and highly dependent on the number of asymptomatic cases.\n\n Moreover, children are at a similar risk of infection to the general population, although less likely to

chronic kidney disease (CKD).\n\n\nMethods\nWe studied adults with CKD in Stockholm during 200611, who not previously been diagnosed with lower respiratory tract infections.\n\n We used multivariable-adjusted Cox regression with pneumonia as a time-varying exposure to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) [95% confidence intervals (CIs)] for the events of death, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), acute kidney injury (AKI), CKD progression or hospitalization for urinary tract infections (UTIs)/sepsis.\n\n Cataract and knee/joint replacement served as negative control outcomes.\n\n\nResults\nWe identified 71931 adults (mean age 79?years, 59% women), of whom 8379 (12%) were diagnosed with pneumonia during follow-up; incident pneumonia was associated with 10 times higher adjusted mortality risk during the first 90?days [HR = 10.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 9.510.5] and double the mortality beyond 90?days from pneumonia diagnosis (HR = 2.0; 95% CI

2019 (Covid-19) has not been well studied.\n\n\nMethods\nWe carried out a population-based casecontrol study in the Lombardy region of Italy.\n\n A total of 6272 case patients in whom infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was confirmed between February 21 and March 11, 2020, were matched to 30,759 beneficiaries of the Regional Health Service (controls) according to sex, age, and municipality of residence.\n\n Information about the use of selected drugs and patients clinical profiles was obtained from regional databases of health care use.\n\n Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for associations between drugs and infection, with adjustment for confounders, were estimated by means of logistic regression.\n\n\nResults\nAmong both case patients and controls, the mean (SD) age was 6813 years, and 37% were women.\n\n The use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs was more common among case patients than among controls, as was the use of other antihypertensive and non-antihypertensive drugs, and case patients had a worse clinical profile.\n\n Use of ARBs or ACE inhibitors did not show any association with Covid-19 among case patients overall (adjusted odds ratio, 0.95 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.86 to 1.05] for ARBs and 0.96 [95% CI, 0.87 to 1.07] for ACE inhibitors) or among patients who had a severe or fatal course of the disease (adjusted odds ratio, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.63 to 1.10] for ARBs and 0.91 [95% CI, 0.69 to 1.21] for ACE inhibitors), and no association between these variables was found according to sex.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn this large, population-based study, the use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs was more frequent among patients with Covid-19 than among controls because of their higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease.\n\n However, there was no evidence that ACE inhibitors or ARBs affected the risk of COVID-19.\n","id":"PMC7206933","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical

patients exposed to coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), because the viral receptor is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).\n\n\nMethods\nWe assessed the relation between previous treatment with ACE inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, or thiazide diuretics and the likelihood of a positive or negative result on Covid-19 testing as well as the likelihood of severe illness (defined as intensive care, mechanical ventilation, or death) among patients who tested positive.\n\n Using Bayesian methods, we compared outcomes in patients who had been treated with these medications and in untreated patients, overall and in those with hypertension, after propensity-score matching for receipt of each medication class.\n\n A difference of at least 10 percentage points was prespecified as a substantial difference.\n\n\nResults\nAmong 12,594 patients who were tested for Covid-19, a total of 5894 (46.8%) were positive; 1002 of these patients (17.0%) had severe illness.\n\n A history of hypertension was present in 4357 patients (34.6%), among whom 2573 (59.1%) had a positive test; 634 of these patients (24.6%) had severe illness.\n\n There was no association between any single medication class and an increased likelihood of a positive test.\n\n None of the medications examined was associated with a substantial increase in the risk of severe illness among patients who tested positive.\n\n\nConclusions\nWe found no substantial increase in the likelihood of a positive test for Covid-19 or in the risk of severe Covid-19 among patients who tested positive in association with five common classes of antihypertensive medications.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7206932","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical

Influenza Disease Burden from Population-Based Surveillance Data in the United States","abstract":"Annual estimates of the influenza disease burden provide information to evaluate programs and allocate resources.\n We used a multiplier method with routine population-based surveillance data on influenza hospitalization in the United States to correct for under-reporting and estimate the burden of influenza for seasons after the 2009 pandemic.\n Five sites of the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET) collected data on the frequency and sensitivity of influenza testing during two seasons to estimate under-detection.\n Population-based rates of influenza-associated hospitalization and Intensive Care Unit admission from 20102013 were extrapolated to the U.\nS.\n population from FluSurv-NET and corrected for under-detection.\n Influenza deaths were calculated using a ratio of deaths to hospitalizations.\n We estimated that influenza-related hospitalizations were under-detected during 2010-11 by a factor of 2.1 (95%CI 1.72.9) for age &lt; 18 years, 3.1 (2.44.5) for ages 18-64 years, and 5.2 (95%CI 3.88.3) for age 65+.\n Results were similar in 2011-12. Extrapolated estimates for 3 seasons from 20102013 included: 114,192624,435 hospitalizations, 18,49195,390 ICU admissions, and 4,91527,174 deaths per year; 5470% of hospitalizations and 7185% of deaths occurred among adults aged 65+.\n Influenza causes a substantial disease burden in the U.\nS.\n that varies by age and season.\n Periodic estimation of multipliers across multiple sites and age groups improves our understanding of influenza detection in sentinel surveillance systems.\n Adjusting surveillance data using a multiplier method is a relatively simple means to estimate the impact of influenza and the subsequent value of interventions to prevent influenza.\n","id":"PMC4349859","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Carrie","surname":"Reed","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sandra S.","surname":"Chaves","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Pam","surname":"Daily Kirley","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ruth","surname":"Emerson","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Deborah","surname":"Aragon","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Emily B.","surname":"Hancock","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lisa","surname":"Butler","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Joan","surname":"Baumbach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gary","surname":"Hollick","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nancy M.","surname":"Bennett","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Matthew R.","surname":"Laidler","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ann","surname":"Thomas","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Martin I.","surname":"Meltzer","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lyn","surname":"Finelli","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]}]},{"doi":"10.1101/2020.05.10.20097253","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The association of cardiovascular disease and other pre-existing comorbidities with COVID-19 mortality: A systematic review and meta-analysis","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Awadhesh KS, Clare LG, Ritu S, Akriti S, Yogini C, Briana C, et al.

We used multivariable logistic regression models with multiple imputation to identify risk factors for positive SARS-CoV-2 tests within this surveillance network.\nFindings\nWe identified 3802 SARS-CoV-2 test results, of which 587 were positive. In multivariable analysis, male sex was independently associated with testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (296 [18 4%] of 1612 men vs 291 [13 3%] of 2190 women; adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1 55, 95% CI 1 27-1 89). Adults were at increased risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 compared with children, and people aged 40-64 years were at greatest risk in the multivariable model (243 [18 5%] of 1316 adults aged 40-64 years vs 23 [4 6%] of 499 children; adjusted OR 5 36, 95% CI 3 28-8 76). Compared with white people, the adjusted odds of a positive test were greater in black people (388 [15 5%] of 2497 white people vs 36 [62 1%] of 58 black people; adjusted OR 4 75, 95% CI 2 65-8 51). People living in urban areas versus rural areas (476 [26 2%] of 1816 in urban areas vs 111 [5 6%] of 1986 in rural areas; adjusted OR 4 59, 95% CI 3 57-5 90) and in more deprived areas (197 [29 5%] of 668 in most deprived vs 143 [7 7%] of 1855 in least deprived; adjusted OR 2 03, 95% CI 1 51-2 71) were more likely to test positive. People with chronic kidney disease were more likely to test positive in the adjusted analysis (68 [32 9%] of 207 with chronic kidney disease vs 519 [14 4%] of 3595 without; adjusted OR 1 91, 95% CI 1 31-2 78), but there was no significant association with other chronic conditions in that analysis. We found increased odds of a positive test among people who are obese (142 [20 9%] of 680 people with obesity vs 171 [13 2%] of 1296 normal-weight people; adjusted OR 1 41, 95% CI 1 04-1 91). Notably, active smoking was linked with decreased odds of a positive test result (47 [11 4%] of 413 active smokers vs 201 [17 9%] of 1125 non-smokers; adjusted OR 0 49, 95% CI 0 34-0 71).\nInterpretation\nA positive SARS-CoV-2 test result in this primary care cohort was associated with similar risk factors as observed for severe outcomes of COVID-19 in hospital settings, except for smoking. We provide evidence of potential sociodemographic factors associated with a positive test, including deprivation, population density, ethnicity, and chronic kidney disease.\nFunding\nWellcome Trust.\nIntroduction\nThe world is in the midst of a pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19. In the UK, the first cases were detected in late January, 2020, and community transmission began at the end of that month. Initial reports from China, Italy, and Spain described clinical characteristics of people diagnosed with COVID-19 and risk factors for poor outcomes, which include older age, male sex, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and diabetes. However, most research to date has been done among patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, meaning risk factors for infection in the general population cannot be directly assessed. Use of primary care data could help identify risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection to inform patient management, public health measures, and more personalised advice to patient groups.\nResearch in context\nEvidence before this study\nWe searched PubMed, MEDLINE, and Trip Medical Database from inception to April 14, 2020, for community-based studies that described the epidemiology of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or the associated illness, COVID-19, using the terms &quot;(COVID-19 or 2019-nCoV or SARS-CoV-2) AND (primary care or general practice or family practice or community)&quot;, with no language restrictions. We found no relevant studies. Hospital-based studies have reported increasing age, male sex, and certain comorbidities, such as hypertension and diabetes, to be associated with more severe COVID-19 disease. Whether these risk factors apply to the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in primary care is unclear.\nAdded value of this study\nWe did a cross-sectional study of patients with a SARS-CoV-2 test code result in the Oxford Royal College of General Practitioners Research and Surveillance Centre network between Jan 28 and April 4, 2020. We observed 587 patients with positive results and 3215 with negative results. Since we have sociodemographic and clinical data on patients in our sample, we could assess risk factors for a positive SARS-CoV-2 result, adjusted for potential confounding variables. Increasing age, male sex, population density, more deprived areas, and black ethnicity were associated with an increased risk of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Chronic kidney disease and obesity were the only clinical factors associated with a positive test. Current smokers had lower odds of a positive test. To our knowledge, this study is one of the first to investigate risk factors for testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the community.\nImplications of all the available evidence\nOur findings suggest some risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection in this primary care study are similar to those associated with more severe COVID-19 disease, with men and people older than 40 years at increased risk. Research is needed into the effect of chronic conditions on the risk of infection and disease severity, ethnic variations in COVID-19 incidence, and the risk to smokers.\nThe Oxford Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre programme is one of the longest established primary care sentinel networks globally. It includes more than 500 urban and non-urban participating general practices, covering a population of over 4 million people (appendix p 1). The Oxford RCGP Research and Surveillance Network supports Public Health England in national surveillance of communicable diseases such as influenza and assessing vaccine effectiveness, including during the 2009 influenza pandemic. The network has adapted for COVID-19 surveillance by enlarging approximately three-fold to improve coverage and by introducing self-swabbing at home to reduce the risk of disease transmission. We aimed to identify demographic and clinical risk factors for testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 within this primary care surveillance programme.\nMethods\nStudy design and participants\nWe did a cross-sectional study in patients in the Oxford RCGP Research and Surveillance Centre network who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 between Jan 28 and April 4, 2020. Pseudonymised SARS-CoV-2 results and other clinical and sociodemographic data were extracted from computerised primary care medical records of sentinel practices. These data allow estimation of household size, deprivation level, and rural-urban classification. Since the last week of January, 2020, Research and Surveillance Centre practices have submitted nasopharyngeal swabs to Public Health England for SARS-CoV-2 testing from patients presenting with symptoms of influenza or respiratory infections. We included tests done through Public Health England surveillance, contact tracing, and routine UK National Health Service (NHS) primary and secondary care services. Although Public Health England surveillance testing has continued largely unchanged throughout the study period, NHS testing initially focused on people who travelled to high-risk countries or close contact tracing, but it has more recently focused on hospital testing and testing of health-care workers.\nRT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 was done at the Public Health England Colindale Laboratory (London, UK) using previously described methods. From early March, testing from routine NHS services was also done in NHS laboratories using standardised, national quality-assured procedures. The analytical specificity of RT-PCR assays for SARS-CoV-2 is greater than 95% and the analytical sensitivity of tests is typically 90-95%, with comparable performance between commercial tests used in the NHS and those used in the Public Health England Colindale Laboratory. Because of the operational nature of this in-pandemic study, various sampling and diagnostic test arrangements were used, with associated quality-assurance procedures.\nWe included patients who were registered at an RCGP Research and Surveillance Centre practice on Sept 30, 2019, who had an entry in their medical record reporting a positive or negative test for SARS-CoV-2. We have developed a COVID-19 surveillance ontology to ensure consistency of case definition and included only people with a coded positive or negative test, and not those with suspected disease (appendix p 2). Patients with codes in their medical records suggesting they had declined any form of data sharing were excluded (around 2 2% of the registered population).\nThe data used for the analysis were pseudonymised at the point of extraction and encrypted before uploading to the Clinical Informatics Research Group secure server. Personal data were not identifiable during the analysis. The data extraction was done as part of national surveillance work commissioned by Public Health England and approved under Regulation 3 of The Health Service (Control of Patient Information) Regulations 2002. This study was approved by the RCGP Research and Surveillance Centre study approval committee and was classified as a study of usual practice. Therefore, no further ethical approval was required.\nStudy variables\nWe included the following independent demographic variables: age, sex, and ethnicity, using an ontology to maximise case identification; practice-level deprivation using the English Index of Multiple Deprivation quintiles (we combined the two most deprived quintiles as there was a low frequency of testing, leading to sparse data, in the most deprived quintile); household size based on pseudonymised patient address; and rural-urban classification. We included the latest recording of the following clinical variables, which are similar to those associated with increased susceptibility to influenza: body-mass index (BMI); smoking status; pregnancy; hypertension; chronic kidney disease; coronary heart disease; chronic respiratory disease, including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; and type 1 and type 2 diabetes. We created a variable combining patients with malignancy and immunocompromise because there were small numbers in each group. Malignancy was identified using most recently recorded disease codes, and we used records of prescriptions for prednisolone and prescriptions for disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs as surrogates for immunosuppression. The outcome variable was testing positive for SARS-CoV-2.\nStatistical analysis\nDemographic and clinical characteristics of cohort\n	Participants (n=3802)	 	SARS-CoV-2 test result	 	Negative	3215 (84 6%)	 	Positive	587 (15 4%)	 	Missing	0	 	Age (years)	 	0-17	499 (13 1%)	 	18-39	666 (17 5%)	 	40-64	1316 (34 6%)	 	65-74	557 (14 7%)	 	&gt;=75	764 (20 1%)	 	Missing	0	 	Sex	 	Female	2190 (57 6%)	 	Male	1612 (42 4%)	 	Missing	0	 	Ethnicity	 	White	2497 (65 7%)	 	Asian	152 (4 0%)	 	Black	58 (1 5%)	 	Mixed, other	81 (2 1%)	 	Missing	1014 (26 7%)	 	Socioeconomic deprivation level*	 	5 (least deprived)	1855 (48 8%)	 	4	633 (16 6%)	 	3	646 (17 0%)	 	1 and 2 (most deprived)	668 (17 6%)	 	Missing	0	 	Household size	 	1	824 (21 7%)	 	2-4	2341 (61 6%)	 	5-8	408 (10 7%)	 	&gt;=9	135 (3 6%)	 	Missing	94 (2 5%)	 	Settlement or population density	 	Rural	1986 (52 2%)	 	Urban	1816 (47 8%)	 	Missing	0	 	Smoking status	 	Non-smoker	1125 (29 6%)	 	Active smoker	413 (10 9%)	 	Ex-smoker	1753 (46 1%)	 	Missing	511 (13 4%)	 	Pregnancy	 	No	3742 (98 4%)	 	Yes	60 (1 6%)	 	Missing	0	 	BMI 	 	Normal weight	1296 (34 1%)	 	Overweight	1095 (28 8%)	 	Obese	680 (17 9%)	 	Severely obese	145 (3 8%)	 	Missing	586 (15 4%)	 	Hypertension	 	No	2708 (71 2%)	 	Yes	1094 (28 8%)	 	Missing	0	 	Chronic kidney disease	 	No	3595 (94 6%)	 	Yes	207 (5 4%)	 	Missing	0	 	Diabetes	 	No	3299 (86 8)	 	Yes	503 (13 2)	 	Missing	0	 	Chronic heart disease	 	No	3202 (84 2%)	 	Yes	600 (15 8%)	 	Missing	0	 	Chronic respiratory disease	 	No	3544 (93 2%)	 	Yes	258 (6 8%)	 	Missing	0	 	Malignancy or immunocompromised	 	No	3164 (83 2%)	 	Yes	638 (16 8%)	 	Missing	0	 	\nData are n (%). SARS-CoV-2=severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.

We described the proportion of participants with missing data for each variable (table 1). We tested for associations between individual covariates and the outcome of a positive test using univariate logistic regression models. We used multivariate logistic regression to identify variables that were associated with a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 after multiple imputation of missing values. We included all variables in the multivariable model. We imputed missing data using the multiple imputation by chained equations method, with five imputed datasets and ten iterations. For each variable, we specified a predictive mean matching model. We used all variables in the multivariable analysis and did not use auxiliary variables. All analysis results were aggregated with Rubin's rule after appropriate transformation. We checked the acceptability of the imputations by comparison of plots of the distribution of recorded and imputed values for all measurements. We used this method under the assumption that the missing observations for covariates were missing at random. We checked collinearity by measuring the variance inflationary factor for each covariate:all were deemed within acceptable bounds, with the maximum value less than 2 0. We also did sensitivity analyses using complete cases only and with missing ethnicity observations imputed using census data. In this analysis, for each person with missing ethnicity in a given lower super output area, we randomly assigned an ethnic group, matching the proportions of the ethnic group based on census proportions.\nWe used R version 3.5.3 for all analyses; we used the R library mice 3.4.0 for the multiple imputation routine.\nRole of the funding source\nThe funder of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the paper. The corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.\nResults\nBetween Jan 28 and April 4, 2020, we observed 587 patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 results and 3215 with negative results in the surveillance programme. The first positive case presented on Jan 30, 2020, and 100 cases was reached on March 17, 2020. Overall, 2190 (57 6%) of 3802 patients were female and 2497 (65 7%) were white (table 1). The median age of patients who had a test was 58 0 years (IQR 34-73) for men and 51 5 years (33-70) for women. 1986 (52 2%) patients lived in rural areas, and 1855 (48 8%) were ranked as least deprived (quintile 5) according to the Index of Multiple Deprivation. The most common clinical conditions were hypertension (1094 [28 8%] patients) and chronic heart disease (600 [15 8%] patients). 267 (7%) results were obtained from Public Health England surveillance testing, whereas 3535 (93%) were identified through surveillance of primary care medical records.\nUnivariable analysis of demographic and clinical risk factors for testing positive for SARS-CoV-2\n		SARS-CoV-2 positivity	Unadjusted odds ratio (95% CI)	p value	 	Age (years)	..	..	&lt;0 0001	 		0-17	23/499 (4 6%)	1 (ref)	..	 		18-39	84/666 (12 6%)	2 98 (1 85-4 81)	..	 		40-64	243/1316 (18 5%)	4 69 (3 00-7 28)	..	 		65-74	88/557 (15 8%)	3 88 (2 40-6 25)	..	 		&gt;=75	149/764 (19 5%)	5 00 (3 18-7 90)	..

BMI=body-mass index.\nSocioeconomic deprivation level was assessed at the practice level using the English Index of Multiple Deprivation quintiles.\nBMI categories were based on WHO classification (normal weight 18 5-24 9 kg/m2, overweight 25 0-29 9 kg/m2, obese 30 0-39 9 kg/m2, severely obese &gt;=40 kg/m2).\nIn multivariable analysis, adjusted for all other variables in table 3, male sex remained independently associated with testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1 55, 95% CI 1 27-1 89). Adults were at increased risk compared with children, and people aged 40-64 years (5 36, 3 28-8 76) and 75 years and older (5 23, 3 00-9 09) were at greatest risk. Compared with white people, black people remained at increased risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (4 75, 2 65-8 51). Urban areas (4 59, 3 57-5 90) versus rural areas, and more deprived areas (most deprived vs least deprived; 2 03, 1 51-2 71) were associated with increased odds of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test.\nActive smoking was associated with decreased odds of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result (adjusted OR 0 49, 95% CI 0 34-0 71). People with chronic kidney disease were more likely than those without to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the adjusted analysis (1 91, 1 31-2 78), but there was no significant association with the other chronic conditions (table 3). We found evidence of increased odds of a positive test among people with obesity compared to those of normal weight (1 41, 1 04-1 91).\nIn sensitivity analyses, we did a complete case analysis (appendix p 3) and imputed missing ethnicity data using local census data (appendix p 4), but found no marked differences in our results.\nDiscussion\nWe report one of the first and largest cross-sectional analyses using primary care data to assess risk factors for testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. In our sample, we found increasing age, male sex, increasing deprivation, urban location, and black ethnicity were associated with increased odds of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Current smoking was linked with decreased odds of a positive test. Chronic kidney disease and increased BMI were the only clinical factors independently associated with a positive test.\nA literature review suggested that COVID-19 has affected more men than women, and principally those aged 30-65 years, with around half of cases being older than 50 years. We found a similar increased risk of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test in men, and in people older than 40 years.\nSARS-CoV-2 transmission is known to be associated with high population density due to increased social mixing, which is consistent with our finding of higher odds of a positive test in urban areas. Social deprivation has been associated with increased risk of other respiratory infections, and there is evidence that the risk of COVID-19-related death is higher in more deprived parts of England, although this analysis has not been adjusted for potential confounders. We found an association between increasing deprivation and increased odds of a positive test, independent of household size, urban location, and smoking. Perhaps surprisingly, we did not find an association between increased household size and risk of SARS-CoV-2 positivity, despite a previously reported higher risk of transmission among household contacts. Behavioural responses to social distancing measures might have accounted for this finding. For example, small households could be studio flats or single-room occupancies without communal space, such that people might be more inclined to risk infection by leaving home.\nPreliminary evidence has raised concerns regarding the potential increased risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes among people of Asian and black ethnicities, but few epidemiological studies have assessed risk by ethnic group. An analysis of 3370 people admitted to intensive care in the UK with confirmed COVID-19 found that 402 (11 9%) were black, 486 (14 4%) were Asian, and 2236 (66 4%) were white, compared with respective national figures of 3 3%, 7 5%, and 86 0%. These results did not adjust for potential sociodemographic or clinical confounders. Overall numbers of black people, Asian people, and people from minority ethnic groups were small in our study, meaning our results should be interpreted with caution. However, we found that black people had higher odds of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result than white people, which remained significant after adjusting for comorbidities such as hypertension and diabetes, the prevalence of which is increased in black ethnic groups. Other socioeconomic factors that we did not measure, such as employment in high-risk positions, education, income, and structural barriers to health care, might have contributed to this association and should be urgently explored.\nSystematic reviews have shown that people with COVID-19 who have chronic comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease are at high risk of progressing to severe COVID-19 disease. Risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection could be different, and we found no evidence of an association between these conditions and a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. We found that chronic kidney disease and obesity were associated with testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. Both chronic kidney disease and obesity have been associated with increased risk of other respiratory infections. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are recommended treatments for chronic kidney disease and have been postulated to impact SARS-CoV-2 host-cell interactions. However observational evidence does not support this effect, and further analyses to investigate the relationship between medications, chronic illnesses, and SARS-CoV-2 positivity.\nPrevious studies have reported that smoking is associated with increased risk of intensive care unit admission or death among people with COVID-19. However, several studies reported a low prevalence of smoking among people with COVID-19. A Chinese study found that only 137 (12 6%) of 1085 patients with COVID-19 were current smokers, compared with 27 7% of Chinese adults, and an analysis of cases by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found only 96 (1 3%) of 7162 COVID-19 cases were active smokers, compared with 13 7% in the general US population. These studies could be biased by confounding and by difficulties in accurately identifying current smokers among patients unwell with COVID-19. We found that active smoking was associated with lower odds of having a positive test result. There are several plausible reasons for this result. Active smoking might affect nasopharyngeal viral load and therefore affect RT-PCR test sensitivity, rather than protecting against actual infection, although this effect is not known to occur with influenza RT-PCR testing. Alternatively, as patients with symptoms are more likely to have been tested and included in our analysis, selection bias could affect this result. Smokers are more likely to have a cough, meaning they might also be more likely to be tested for SARS-CoV-2 than non-smokers, even if they are SARS-CoV-2 negative. This more frequent testing could increase the proportion of smokers with negative SARS-CoV-2 results in our sample, which would bias our results. However, the proportion of smokers in our study was low. Furthermore, ex-smokers and people with chronic lung disease would also be expected to cough more, but these groups did not have higher odds of SARS-CoV-2 test positivity. Therefore, the relationship between smoking and SARS-CoV-2 infection merits further investigation. Nicotine might downregulate angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors, which are used by SARS-CoV-2 for cell entry, although studies have found increased angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 lung expression among smokers and people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Our findings should not be used to conclude that smoking prevents SARS-CoV-2 infection, or to encourage ongoing smoking, particularly given the well documented harms to overall health from smoking, the potential for smoking to increase COVID-19 disease severity, and the possible alternative explanations for these findings.\nTo our knowledge, our study is one of the first to report risk factors for testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. Our use of rich primary care surveillance data allowed adjustment for potential confounding factors. The Oxford RCGP Research and Surveillance Centre is an established network of sentinel practices, meaning clinicians are experienced in undertaking surveillance research and use coding ontologies to standardise reporting.\nLike all routine datasets, some data will be missing from our set. Where data are missing at random, multiple imputation has the potential to reduce bias and improve precision. However, the missing at random assumption is not testable. In certain situations when the missing at random assumption does not hold, we can rely on a complete-case analysis to provide unbiased estimates (eg, when the likelihood of being a complete case is independent of the outcome, conditional on the other covariates). In this study, we presented both approaches, with similar results. We acknowledge that ethnicity, for example, might not be missing at random. However, our findings remained unchanged in a sensitivity analysis that did not rely on the missing at random assumption, in which we imputed missing ethnicity based on ethnicity proportions in each participant's local geographical area.\nAlthough our study population of primary care patients is likely to be more similar to the general population than that of hospital-based studies, there remains a risk of selection bias because results might reflect the groups of patients who were more likely to present for assessment and be selected for SARS-CoV-2 testing in accordance with guidelines. If certain groups (eg, men, people in deprived areas, non-smokers, and black people) are only likely to present or be tested when more severely unwell, those who were tested could be more likely to be positive for COVID-19. Conversely, groups with lower thresholds for presentation might be tested with less severe symptoms, and therefore be more likely to test negative. It was not possible to assess the effects of thresholds for presentation and changes in testing guidelines in this analysis. Population-based surveys should ensure consistent levels of testing across subgroups as far as possible to reduce the risk of selection bias.\nAlthough RT-PCR testing is the gold standard for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, overall test sensitivity in clinical use might be reduced by factors such as swab technique and the timing relative to symptom onset. Therefore, some SARS-CoV-2 cases could have been missed, particularly among patients with lower viral loads, which could bias results if any of the variables that we studied (eg, active smoking) were associated with differences in viral load, rather than actual infection. Also, the sentinel network changed from in-practice nasopharyngeal swabbing to self-swabbing on March 14, 2020, which nonetheless has been found to be a reliable method when testing for influenza.\nFurther data are needed to establish the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2, particularly in relation to emerging factors such as ethnicity, deprivation, population density, and smoking. Population-based surveys could help reduce selection bias and ensure adequate inclusion of different population subgroups. Our data from primary care could help monitor incident infections and, therefore, the effect of public health mearues, and we plan analyses of rates of hospitalisation and death as the pandemic unfolds.\nIn conclusion, primary care sentinel network data provide important insights into the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2, although our study is limited by its small scale and selection of patients presenting for SARS-CoV-2 testing through routing health-care services. Our findings on smoking might be due to presentation confounding and should not encourage people to continue or take up smoking. Increasing age, male sex, socioeconomic deprivation, increased population density, black ethnicity, chronic kidney disease, and obesity were all associated with increased risk of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test.\nData sharing\nThe Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre dataset can be accessed by researchers.

Transmission Dynamics in Wuhan, China, of Novel CoronavirusInfected Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nThe initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7121484","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical Society","authors":[{"firstname":"Qun","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuhua","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoye","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yeqing","surname":"Tong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ruiqi","surname":"Ren","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kathy S.M.","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Eric H.Y.","surname":"Lau","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jessica Y.","surname":"Wong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuesen","surname":"Xing","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nijuan","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chao","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tian","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Man","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wenxiao","surname":"Tu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chuding","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lianmei","surname":"Jin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rui","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Suhua","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rui","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yinbo","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ge","surname":"Shao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhongfa","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhiqiang","surname":"Deng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Boxi","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhitao","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yanping","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guoqing","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tommy T.Y.","surname":"Lam","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Joseph T.","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"George F.","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Benjamin J.","surname":"Cowling","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gabriel M.","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zijian","surname":"Feng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1101/2020.02.07.937862","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus: the species and its viruses:a statement of the Coronavirus Study Group","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30211-7","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study","abstract":"Background\nIn December, 2019, a pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China.\n\n We aimed to further clarify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020.

Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having

virus genome from a patient with 2019-nCoV infection and compared it with other related coronavirus genomes.\n Overall, the genome of 2019-nCoV has 89% nucleotide identity with bat SARS-like-CoVZXC21 and 82% with that of human SARS-CoV.\n The phylogenetic trees of their orf1a/b, Spike, Envelope, Membrane and Nucleoprotein also clustered closely with those of the bat, civet and human SARS coronaviruses.\n However, the external subdomain of Spikes receptor binding domain of 2019-nCoV shares only 40% amino acid identity with other SARS-related coronaviruses.\n Remarkably, its orf3b encodes a completely novel short protein.\n Furthermore, its new orf8 likely encodes a secreted protein with an alpha-helix, following with a beta-sheet(s) containing six strands.\n Learning from the roles of civet in SARS and camel in MERS, hunting for the animal source of 2019-nCoV and its more ancestral virus would be important for understanding the origin and evolution of this novel lineage B betacoronavirus.\n These findings provide the basis for starting further studies on the pathogenesis, and optimizing the design of diagnostic, antiviral and vaccination strategies for this emerging infection.\n","id":"PMC7067204","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Taylor &amp; Francis","authors":[{"firstname":"Jasper

characterisation and epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 9998% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and

clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings of emerging 2019-nCoV pneumonia in humans.\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\nFifty-one patients (25 men and 26 women; age range 1676 years) with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction underwent thin-section CT.\n\n The imaging findings, clinical data, and laboratory data were evaluated.\n\n\nResults\nFifty of 51 patients (98%) had a history of contact with individuals from the endemic center in Wuhan, China.\n\n Fever (49 of 51, 96%) and cough (24 of 51, 47%) were the most common symptoms.\n\n Most patients had a normal white blood cell count (37 of 51, 73%), neutrophil count (44 of 51, 86%), and either normal (17 of 51, 35%) or reduced (33 of 51, 65%) lymphocyte count.\n\n CT images showed pure ground-glass opacity (GGO) in 39 of 51 (77%) patients and GGO with reticular and/or interlobular septal thickening in 38 of 51 (75%) patients.\n\n GGO with consolidation was present in 30 of 51 (59%) patients, and pure consolidation was present in 28 of 51 (55%) patients.\n\n Forty-four of 51 (86%) patients had bilateral lung involvement, while 41 of 51 (80%) involved the posterior part of the lungs and 44 of 51 (86%) were peripheral.\n\n There were more consolidated lung lesions in patients 5 days or more from disease onset to CT scan versus 4 days or fewer (431 of 712 lesions vs 129 of 612 lesions; P &lt; .\n\n001).\n\n Patients older than 50 years had more consolidated lung lesions than did those aged 50 years or younger (212 of 470 vs 198 of 854; P &lt; .\n\n001).\n\n Follow-up CT in 13 patients showed improvement in seven (54%) patients and progression in four (31%) patients.\n\n\nConclusion\nPatients with fever and/or cough and with conspicuous ground-glass opacity lesions in the peripheral and posterior lungs on CT images, combined with normal or decreased white blood cells and a history of epidemic exposure, are highly suspected of having 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7233366","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Radiological Society of North

public health and medicinal measures will both be needed to contain spreading of the virus and to optimize patient outcomes.\n Although little is known about the virus, an examination of the genome sequence shows strong homology with its better?studied cousin, SARS?CoV.\n The spike protein used for host cell infection shows key nonsynonymous mutations that might hamper the efficacy of previously developed therapeutics but remains a viable target for the development of biologics and macrocyclic peptides.\n Other key drug targets, including RNA?dependent RNA polymerase and coronavirus main proteinase (3CLpro), share a strikingly high (&gt;95?%) homology to SARS?CoV.\n Herein, we suggest four potential drug candidates (an ACE2?based peptide, remdesivir, 3CLpro?1 and a novel vinylsulfone protease inhibitor) that could be used to treat patients suffering with the 2019?nCoV.\n We also summarize previous efforts into drugging these targets and hope to help in the development of

face bacterial, fungal and viral infections in the 21st century","abstract":"Chloroquine (CQ) and its hydroxyl analogue hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) are weak bases with a half-century long use as antimalarial agents.\n Apart from this antimalarial activity, CQ and HCQ have gained interest in the field of other infectious diseases.\n One of the most interesting mechanisms of action is that CQ leads to alkalinisation of acid vesicles that inhibit the growth of several intracellular bacteria and fungi.\n The proof of concept of this effect was first used to restore intracellular pH allowing antibiotic efficacy for Coxiella burnetii, the agent of Q fever, and doxycycline plus HCQ is now the reference treatment for chronic Q fever.\n There is also strong evidence of a similar effect in vitro against Tropheryma whipplei, the agent of Whipple's disease, and a clinical trial is in progress.\n Other bacteria and fungi multiply in an acidic environment and encouraging in vitro data suggest that this concept may be generalised for all intracellular organisms that multiply in an acidic environment.\n For viruses, CQ led to inhibition of uncoating and/or alteration of post-translational modifications of newly synthesised proteins, especially inhibition of glycosylation.\n These effects have been well described in vitro for many viruses, with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) being the most studied.\n Preliminary in vivo clinical trials suggest that CQ alone or in combination with antiretroviral drugs might represent an interesting way to treat HIV infection.\n In conclusion, our review re-emphasises the paradigm that activities mediated by lysosomotropic agents may offer an interesting weapon to face present and future infectious diseases

humans.\n Human-to-human transmissions have been described with incubation times between 2-10 days, facilitating its spread via droplets, contaminated hands or surfaces.\n We therefore reviewed the literature on all available information about the persistence of human and veterinary coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces as well as inactivation strategies with biocidal agents used for chemical disinfection, e.\ng.\n in healthcare facilities.\n The analysis of 22 studies reveals that human coronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus or endemic human coronaviruses (HCoV) can persist on inanimate surfaces like metal, glass or plastic for up to 9 days, but can be efficiently inactivated by surface disinfection procedures with 6271% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite within 1 minute.\n Other biocidal agents such as 0.050.2% benzalkonium chloride or 0.02% chlorhexidine digluconate are less effective.\n As no specific therapies are available for SARS-CoV-2, early containment and prevention of further spread will be crucial to stop the ongoing outbreak and to control this novel infectious thread.\n","id":"PMC7132493","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"The Healthcare Infection Society.

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020.

SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 597 (SD 133) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (615%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 311) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (646 years [112] vs 519 years [129]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (135%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 12 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

uncertainty regarding the population denominator, especially in health systems where patient registration is not required.\n\n\nMethods\nBased on the observation of a positive association between number of cases reported and number of consultations by the participating general practitioners (GPs), we define several weighted incidence estimators using external information on consultation volume in GPs.\n\n These estimators are applied to data reported in a French primary care surveillance system based on voluntary GPs (the Sentinelles network) for comparison.\n\n\nResults\nDepending on hypotheses for weight computations, relative changes in weekly national-level incidence estimates up to 3% for influenza, 6% for diarrhea, and 11% for varicella were observed.\n\n The use of consultation-weighted estimates led to bias reduction in the estimates.\n\n At the regional level (NUTS2 level - Nomenclature of Statistical Territorial Units Level 2), relative changes were even larger between incidence estimates, with changes between -40% and +55%.\n\n Using bias-reduced weights decreased variation in incidence between regions and increased spatial autocorrelation.\n\n\nConclusions\nPost-stratification using external administrative data may improve incidence estimates in surveillance systems based on voluntary

prescribing quality indicators","abstract":"Background\nInformation on prescribing quality is increasingly used by policy makers, insurance companies and health care providers.\n\n For reliable assessment of prescribing quality it is important to correctly identify the patients eligible for recommended treatment.\n\n Often either diagnostic codes or clinical measurements are used to identify such patients.\n\n We compared these two approaches regarding the outcome of the prescribing quality assessment and their ability to identify treated and undertreated patients.\n\n\nMethods\nThe approaches were compared using electronic health records for 3214 diabetes patients from 70 general practitioners.\n\n We selected three existing prescribing quality indicators (PQI) assessing different aspects of treatment in patients with hypertension or who were overweight.\n\n We compared population level prescribing quality scores and proportions of identified patients using definitions of hypertension or being overweight based on diagnostic codes, clinical measurements or both.\n\n\nResults\nThe prescribing quality score for prescribing any antihypertensive treatment was 93% (95% confidence interval 90-95%) using the diagnostic code-based approach, and 81% (78-83%) using the measurement-based approach.\n\n Patients receiving antihypertensive treatment had a better registration of their diagnosis compared to hypertensive patients in whom such treatment was not initiated.\n\n Scores on the other two PQI were similar for the different approaches, ranging from 64 to 66%.\n\n For all PQI, the clinical measurement -based approach identified higher proportions of both well treated and undertreated patients compared to the diagnostic code -based approach.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe use of clinical measurements is recommended when PQI are used to identify undertreated patients.\n\n Using diagnostic codes or clinical measurement values has little impact on the outcomes of proportion-based PQI when both numerator and denominator are equally affected.\n\n In situations when a diagnosis is better registered for treated than untreated patients, as we observed for hypertension, the diagnostic code-based approach results in overestimation of provided treatment.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2890640","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

infection is associated with serious adverse events leading to hospitalization, debilitating complications, and death in elderly individuals.\n Immunization is considered to be the cornerstone for preventing these adverse health outcomes, and vaccination programs are timed to optimize protection during the annual influenza season.\n Trivalent inactivated influenza virus vaccines are believed to be both effective and cost-saving; however, in spite of widespread influenza vaccination programs, rates of hospitalization for acute respiratory illness and cardiovascular diseases have been increasing in this population during recent annual influenza seasons.\n From meta-analyses summarizing estimates of influenza vaccine effectiveness from available observational clinical studies, this review aims to examine how effective current influenza vaccine strategies are in the aging and older adult population and to analyze which are the most important biases that interfere with measurements of influenza vaccine effectiveness.\n Furthermore, consideration is given to strategies that should be adopted in order to optimize influenza vaccine effectiveness in the face of immune

evaluates the representativeness of the RCGP RSC network against the English population.\n\n\nParticipants and method\nThe cohort includes 1?042?063 patients registered in 107 participating general practitioner (GP) practices.\n\n We compared the RCGP RSC data with English national data in the following areas: demographics; geographical distribution; chronic disease prevalence, management and completeness of data recording; and prescribing and vaccine uptake.\n\n We also assessed practices within the network participating in a national swabbing programme.\n\n\nFindings to date\nWe found a small over-representation of people in the 2544 age band, under-representation of white ethnicity, and of less deprived people.\n\n Geographical focus is in London, with less practices in the southwest and east of England.\n\n We found differences in the prevalence of diabetes (national: 6.4%, RCPG RSC: 5.8%), learning disabilities (national: 0.44%, RCPG RSC: 0.40%), obesity (national: 9.2%, RCPG RSC: 8.0%), pulmonary disease (national: 1.8%, RCPG RSC: 1.6%), and cardiovascular diseases (national: 1.1%, RCPG RSC: 1.2%).\n\n Data completeness in risk factors for diabetic population is high (7799%).\n\n We found differences in prescribing rates and costs for infections (national: 5.58%, RCPG RSC: 7.12%), and for nutrition and blood conditions (national: 6.26%, RCPG RSC:

relevance for specific studies.\n\n This network is a rich source for research into routine practice.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4838708","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BMJ Publishing

Mutation in the Egg-Adapted H3N2 Vaccine Strain Not Antigenic Drift in Circulating Viruses","abstract":"Background\nInfluenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) is generally interpreted in the context of vaccine match/mismatch to circulating strains with evolutionary drift in the latter invoked to explain reduced protection.\n\n During the 201213 season, however, detailed genotypic and phenotypic characterization shows that low VE was instead related to mutations in the egg-adapted H3N2 vaccine strain rather than antigenic drift in circulating viruses.\n\n\nMethods/Findings\nComponent-specific VE against medically-attended, PCR-confirmed influenza was estimated in Canada by test-negative case-control design.\n\n Influenza A viruses were characterized genotypically by amino acid (AA) sequencing of established haemagglutinin (HA) antigenic sites and phenotypically through haemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay.\n\n H3N2 viruses were characterized in relation to the WHO-recommended, cell-passaged vaccine prototype (A/Victoria/361/2011) as well as the egg-adapted strain as per actually used in vaccine production.\n\n Among the total of 1501 participants, influenza virus was detected in 652 (43%).\n\n Nearly two-thirds of viruses typed/subtyped were A(H3N2) (394/626; 63%); the remainder were A(H1N1)pdm09 (79/626; 13%), B/Yamagata (98/626; 16%) or B/Victoria (54/626; 9%).\n\n Suboptimal VE of 50% (95%CI: 3363%) overall was driven by predominant H3N2 activity for which VE was 41% (95%CI: 1759%).\n\n All H3N2 field isolates were HI-characterized as well-matched to the WHO-recommended A/Victoria/361/2011 prototype whereas all but one were antigenically distinct from the egg-adapted strain as per actually used in vaccine production.\n\n The egg-adapted strain was itself antigenically distinct from the WHO-recommended prototype, and bore three AA mutations at antigenic sites B [H156Q, G186V] and D [S219Y].\n\n Conversely, circulating viruses were identical to the WHO-recommended prototype at these positions with other genetic variation that did not affect antigenicity.\n\n VE was 59% (95%CI:1680%) against A(H1N1)pdm09, 67% (95%CI: 3085%) against B/Yamagata (vaccine-lineage) and 75% (95%CI: 2991%) against B/Victoria (non-vaccine-lineage) viruses.\n\n\nConclusions\nThese findings underscore the need to monitor vaccine viruses as well as circulating strains to explain vaccine performance.\n\n Evolutionary drift in circulating viruses cannot be regulated, but influential mutations introduced as part of egg-based vaccine production may be amenable to improvements.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3965421","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Danuta

influenza H3N2 vaccine","abstract":"The effectiveness of the annual influenza vaccine has declined in recent years, especially for the H3N2 component, and is a concern for global public health.\n A major cause for this lack in effectiveness has been attributed to the egg-based vaccine production process.\n Substitutions on the hemagglutinin glycoprotein (HA) often arise during virus passaging that change its antigenicity and hence vaccine effectiveness.\n Here, we characterize the effect of a prevalent substitution, L194P, in egg-passaged H3N2 viruses.\n X-ray structural analysis reveals that this substitution surprisingly increases the mobility of the 190-helix and neighboring regions in antigenic site B, which forms one side of the receptor binding site (RBS) and is immunodominant in recent human H3N2 viruses.\n Importantly, the L194P substitution decreases binding and neutralization by an RBS-targeted broadly neutralizing antibody by three orders of magnitude and significantly changes the HA antigenicity as measured by binding of human serum antibodies.\n The receptor binding mode and specificity are also altered to adapt to avian receptors during egg passaging.\n Overall, these findings help explain the low effectiveness of the seasonal vaccine against H3N2 viruses, and suggest that alternative approaches should be accelerated for producing influenza vaccines as well as isolating clinical isolates.\n","id":"PMC5667890","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Nicholas

paediatric influenza vaccination on existing influenza vaccination programmes in England and Wales: a modelling and cost-effectiveness analysis","abstract":"Background\nIn 2013 England and Wales began to fund a live attenuated influenza vaccine programme for individuals aged 216 years.\n\n Mathematical modelling predicts substantial beneficial herd effects for the entire population as a result of reduced influenza transmission.\n\n With a decreased influenza-associated disease burden, existing immunisation programmes might be less cost-effective.\n\n The aim of this study was to assess the epidemiological effect and cost-effectiveness of the existing elderly and risk group vaccination programme under the new policy of mass paediatric vaccination in England.\n\n\nMethods\nFor this cost-effectiveness analysis, we used a transmission model of seasonal influenza calibrated to 14 seasons of weekly consultation and virology data in England and Wales.\n\n We combined this model with an economic evaluation to calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, measured in cost per quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) gained.\n\n\nFindings\nOur results suggest that well timed administration of paediatric vaccination would reduce the number of low-risk elderly influenza cases to a greater extent than would vaccination of the low-risk elderly themselves if the elderly uptake is achieved more slowly.\n\n Although high-risk vaccination remains cost-effective, substantial uncertainty exists as to whether low-risk elderly vaccination remains cost-effective, driven by the choice of cost-effectiveness threshold.\n\n Under base case assumptions and a cost-effectiveness threshold of 15?000 per QALY, the low-risk elderly seasonal vaccination programme will cease to be cost-effective with a mean incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 22?000 per QALY and a probability of cost-effectiveness of 20%.\n\n However, under a 30?000 per QALY threshold, the programme will remain cost-effective with 83% probability.\n\n\nInterpretation\nWith the likely move to decreased cost-effectiveness thresholds, reassessment of existing risk group-based vaccine programme cost-effectiveness in the presence of the paediatric vaccination programme is needed.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Institute for Health Research, the Medical Research

These estimates demonstrate moderate to good levels of protection, particularly against influenza B in children, but relatively less against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09.

principles for sharing bio-specimens and data","abstract":"There is a growing international agreement on the need to provide greater access to research data and bio-specimen collections to optimize their long-term value and exploit their potential for health discovery and validation.\n This is especially evident for rare disease research.\n Currently, the rising value of data and bio-specimen collections does not correspond with an equal increase in data/sample-sharing and data/sample access.\n Contradictory legal and ethical frameworks across national borders are obstacles to effective sharing: more specifically, the absence of an integrated model proves to be a major logistical obstruction.\n The Charter intends to amend the obstacle by providing both the ethical foundations on which data sharing should be based, as well as a general Material and Data Transfer Agreement (MTA/DTA).\n This Charter is the result of a careful negotiation of different stakeholders' interest and is built on earlier consensus documents and position statements, which provided the general international legal framework.\n Further to this, the Charter provides tools that may help accelerate sharing.\n The Charter has been formulated to serve as an enabling tool for effective and transparent data and bio-specimen sharing and the general MTA/DTA constitutes a mechanism to ensure uniformity of access across projects and countries, and may be regarded as a consistent basic agreement for addressing data and material sharing globally.\n The Charter is forward looking in terms of emerging issues from the perspective of a multi-stakeholder group, and where possible, provides strategies that may address these issues.\n","id":"PMC4795058","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing

nasopharyngeal virology swabs.\n\n Patients who attend a scheduled blood test will be consented to donate additional blood samples.\n\n Approximately 100150 blood samples will be collected from each of the following age bands  18 29, 30 39, 40 49, 50 59, 60 69 and 70+ years.\n\n\nMethods\nWe will send the samples to the Public Health England (PHE) Seroepidemiology Unit for processing and storage.\n\n These samples will be tested for influenza antibodies, using haemagglutination inhibition assays.\n\n Serology results will be pseudonymised, sent to the RCGP RSC and combined using

Weekly incidence using the ontological definition was 17.93/100,000 (95% CI 15.63-20.41), whereas for the ICD-10 definition the rate was 8.13/100,000 (95% CI 6.70-9.87), and for the RSC definition the rate was 10.24/100,000 (95% CI 8.55-12.12).\n\n Codes from the four supporting concepts were generally consistent across our three IID case definitions: 37.38% (3905/10,448) (95% CI 36.16-38.5) for the ontological definition, 38.33% (2287/5966) (95% CI 36.79-39.93) for the RSC definition, and 40.82% (1933/4736) (95% CI 39.03-42.66) for the ICD-10 definition.\n\n The proportion of laboratory results associated with a positive test result was 19.68% (546/2775).\n\n\nConclusions\nThe standard RCGP RSC definition of IID, and its mapping to ICD-10, underestimates disease incidence.\n\n The ontological approach identified a larger proportion of new IID cases; the ontology divides contributory elements and enables transparency and comparison of rates.\n\n Results illustrate how improved diagnostic coding of IID combined with an ontological approach to case definition would provide a clearer picture of IID in the community, better inform GPs and public health services about circulating disease, and empower them to respond.\n\n We need to improve the Pathology Bounded Code List (PBCL) currently used by laboratories to electronically report results.\n\n Given advances in stool microbiology testing with a move to nonculture, PCR-based methods, the way microbiology results are reported and coded via PBCL needs to be reviewed and modernized.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5639210","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"JMIR Publications","authors":[{"firstname":"Gunther","surname":"Eysenbach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Samuli","surname":"Pesl","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Samuli","surname":"Pesl","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Alexander","surname":"Rodin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Simon","surname":"de Lusignan","email":"s.lusignan@surrey.ac.uk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Simon","surname":"de Lusignan","email":"s.lusignan@surrey.ac.uk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Stacy","surname":"Shinneman","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Stacy","surname":"Shinneman","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ivelina","surname":"Yonova","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ivelina","surname":"Yonova","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jeremy","surname":"van Vlymen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jeremy","surname":"van Vlymen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Alex J","surname":"Elliot","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Alex J","surname":"Elliot","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Frederick","surname":"Bolton","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Frederick","surname":"Bolton","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gillian E","surname":"Smith","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Gillian E","surname":"Smith","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sarah","surname":"O'Brien","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Sarah","surname":"O'Brien","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1136/bmjhci-2019-100013","date":"2019-05-28","title":"Ontology to identify pregnant women in electronic health records: primary care sentinel network database study","abstract":"Objective\nTo develop an ontology to identify pregnant women from computerised medical record systems with dissimilar coding systems in a primary care sentinel network.\n\n\nMaterials and methods\nWe used a three-step approach to develop our pregnancy ontology in two different coding schemata, one hierarchical and the other polyhierarchical.\n\n We developed a coding systemindependent pregnancy case identification algorithm using the Royal College of General Practitioners Research and Surveillance Centre sentinel network database which held 1.8 million patients data drawn from 150 primary care providers.\n\n We tested the algorithm by examining individual patient records in a 10% random sample of all women aged 29 in each year from 2004 to 2016.

We conclude that R0 and initial population susceptibility were strongly related, emphasising the challenges of identifying these parameters.\n Relatively high R0 values alongside low initial

The virus (2019-nCoV) has spread elsewhere in China and to 24 countries, including South Korea, Thailand, Japan and USA.\n Fortunately, there has only been limited human-to-human transmission outside of China.\n Here, we assess the risk of sustained transmission whenever the coronavirus arrives in other countries.\n Data describing the times from symptom onset to hospitalisation for 47 patients infected early in the current outbreak are used to generate an estimate for the probability that an imported case is followed by sustained human-to-human transmission.\n Under the assumptions that the imported case is representative of the patients in China, and that the 2019-nCoV is similarly transmissible to the SARS coronavirus, the probability that an imported case is followed by sustained human-to-human transmission is 0.41 (credible interval [0.27, 0.55]).\n However, if the mean time from symptom onset to hospitalisation can be halved by intense surveillance, then the probability that an imported case leads to sustained transmission is only 0.012 (credible interval [0, 0.099]).\n This emphasises the importance of current surveillance efforts in countries around the world, to ensure that the ongoing outbreak will not become a global pandemic.\n","id":"PMC7073840","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"Robin

Weekly incidence using the ontological definition was 17.93/100,000 (95% CI 15.63-20.41), whereas for the ICD-10 definition the rate was 8.13/100,000 (95% CI 6.70-9.87), and for the RSC definition the rate was 10.24/100,000 (95% CI 8.55-12.12).\n\n Codes from the four supporting concepts were generally consistent across our three IID case definitions: 37.38% (3905/10,448) (95% CI 36.16-38.5) for the ontological definition, 38.33% (2287/5966) (95% CI 36.79-39.93) for the RSC definition, and 40.82% (1933/4736) (95% CI 39.03-42.66) for the ICD-10 definition.\n\n The proportion of laboratory results associated with a positive test result was 19.68% (546/2775).\n\n\nConclusions\nThe standard RCGP RSC definition of IID, and its mapping to ICD-10, underestimates disease incidence.\n\n The ontological approach identified a larger proportion of new IID cases; the ontology divides contributory elements and enables transparency and comparison of rates.\n\n Results illustrate how improved diagnostic coding of IID combined with an ontological approach to case definition would provide a clearer picture of IID in the community, better inform GPs and public health services about circulating disease, and empower them to respond.\n\n We need to improve the Pathology Bounded Code List (PBCL) currently used by laboratories to electronically report results.\n\n Given advances in stool microbiology testing with a move to nonculture, PCR-based methods, the way microbiology results are reported and coded via PBCL needs to be reviewed and modernized.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5639210","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"JMIR Publications","authors":[{"firstname":"Gunther","surname":"Eysenbach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Samuli","surname":"Pesl","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Samuli","surname":"Pesl","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Alexander","surname":"Rodin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Simon","surname":"de Lusignan","email":"s.lusignan@surrey.ac.uk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Simon","surname":"de Lusignan","email":"s.lusignan@surrey.ac.uk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Stacy","surname":"Shinneman","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Stacy","surname":"Shinneman","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ivelina","surname":"Yonova","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ivelina","surname":"Yonova","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jeremy","surname":"van Vlymen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jeremy","surname":"van Vlymen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Alex J","surname":"Elliot","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Alex J","surname":"Elliot","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Frederick","surname":"Bolton","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Frederick","surname":"Bolton","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gillian E","surname":"Smith","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gillian E","surname":"Smith","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sarah","surname":"O'Brien","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sarah","surname":"O'Brien","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.5551/jat.29397","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Evaluation of obesity in school-age children","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.14236/jhi.v23i4.920","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Ethnicity Recording in Primary Care Computerised Medical Record Systems: An Ontological Approach","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"English_Indices_of_Deprivation_2015_-_Frequently_Asked_Questions_Dec_2016.pdf URL: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/579151/.

We considered hospitalizations for the following diagnoses: non-bacterial gastroenteritis, bacterial gastroenteritis and dehydration (along with a secondary diagnosis of gastroenteritis).\n\n The data source was the hospital discharge records database.\n\n All rates were stratified by age.\n\n\nResults\nIn the study period, there were 61,130 pediatric hospitalizations for non-bacterial gastroenteritis, 5,940 for bacterial gastroenteritis, and 38,820 for dehydration.\n\n In &lt;1-year group, the relative risk of hospitalization for non-bacterial gastroenteritis was 24 times higher than in adolescents, then it dropped to 14.5 in 1- to 4-year-olds and to 3.2 in 5- to 9-year-olds.\n\n At the national level, the percentage of admissions for bacterial gastroenteritis was small compared with non-bacterial, while including admissions for dehydration revealed a significant variability in diagnostic coding among regions that affected the regional performance of the indicator.\n\n\nConclusions\nFor broadest application, we propose a pediatric gastroenteritis admission rate that consists of including bacterial gastroenteritis and dehydration diagnoses in the numerator, as well as infants aged &lt;3months.\n\n We also suggest adjusting for age and including day hospital admissions.\n\n Future evaluation by a clinical panel at the national level might be helpful to determine appropriate application for such measures, and make recommendations to policy makers.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3923239","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Jacopo","surname":"Lenzi","email":"jacopo.lenzi2@unibo.it","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lorenza","surname":"Luciano","email":"lorenza.luciano2@unibo.it","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kathryn Mack","surname":"McDonald","email":"Kathryn.McDonald@stanford.edu","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Simona","surname":"Rosa","email":"simona.rosa@unibo.it","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gianfranco","surname":"Damiani","email":"gdamiani@rm.unicatt.it","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Giovanni","surname":"Corsello","email":"giocors@alice.it","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Maria Pia","surname":"Fantini","email":"mariapia.fantini@unibo.it","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.ijid.2011.02.006","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Gastroenteritis in childhood: a retrospective study of 650 hospitalized pediatric patients","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(16)00620-6","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical workload in UK primary care: a retrospective analysis of 100 million consultations in England, 200714","abstract":"Background\nPrimary care is the main source of health care in many health systems, including the UK National Health Service (NHS), but few objective data exist for the volume and nature of primary care activity.\n\n With rising concerns that NHS primary care workload has increased substantially, we aimed to assess the direct clinical workload of general practitioners (GPs) and practice nurses in primary care in the UK.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did a retrospective analysis of GP and nurse consultations of non-temporary patients registered at 398 English general practices between April, 2007, and March, 2014.

among adults in Delhi","abstract":"Background and Objectives:\nAllergic Rhinitis is rather erroneously viewed as a trivial disease.\n\n It is important in that it can significantly affect quality of life.\n\n There is paucity of community based prevalence studies on the disease in India.\n\n This study was planned to assess the prevalence of allergic rhinitis in adults, the proportion of asthmatics among them, risk factors associated and treatment seeking behaviour among the patients.\n\n\nMaterials and Methods:\nA community based cross sectional study was conducted in Mehrauli, South Delhi among 1200 adults, aged 30 years and over selected by systematic random sampling from two randomly selected wards.\n\n A pre-tested questionnaire was used to collect information regarding symptoms, risk factors and treatment seeking behaviour.\n\n Allergic Rhinitis was diagnosed as per ARIA guidelines.\n\n Spirometry was done to diagnose asthma among them.\n\n Multivariate logistic regression analysis was done to find the association of risk factors with disease.\n\n\nResults:\nThe prevalence of Allergic Rhinitis was found to be 11% (132 subjects) and 33.3% (44 patients) among them also had asthma.\n\n Overcrowding (aOR = 6.4), absence of cross-ventilation (aOR = 2.5), occupational exposure to dust/smoke (aOR = 2.1), tobacco smoking (aOR = 2.1), family history of allergic diseases (aOR = 2.7) and clinical allergy (aOR = 10.2) were found to be independent risk factors associated with Rhinitis.\n\n More patients of Rhinitis with asthma (75%) took treatment, relative to those without asthma (40%) who, mostly relied on home remedies (42%) or, did not seek any treatment (18%) (P = 0.031).\n\n\nInterpretations and Conclusion:\nThe burden of Allergic Rhinitis is high with a considerable overlap with asthma.\n\n These allergic diseases and emphasize the importance of early and regular treatment.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4943409","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Medknow Publications &amp; Media Pvt

sexually transmitted infections.\n\n Most university students belong to this age group but little is known about their sexual behaviours.\n\n The aim of the study was to explore university students perspectives of factors and mechanisms that influence risky sexual behaviours among university students in the United Kingdom.\n\n\nMethods\nAll students at a university in a northern city of England were invited via email to participate in qualitative telephone interviews.\n\n Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim.\n\n Framework analytical approach was used.\n\n\nResults\nTwenty interviews were conducted with a diverse sample of students.\n\n The social context of university lifestyle was perceived to affect risky sex through high levels of alcohol consumption, increased sexual opportunities, liberation from moral surveillance and expectations of the stereotypical highly sexually active student.\n\n Individual and cultural differences were also perceived to account for some patterns of risky sex with older students, overseas students and religious students perceived to be less likely to engage in risky sex due to academic priorities and a tendency to be more likely to adhere to moral values.\n\n Risk denial was also a key factor that led students to engage in risky sex.\n\n Poor access to sexual health services including inconvenient opening times, lack of confidentiality and stigma were perceived to contribute to the limited use of sexually transmitted infections testing and contraceptive services.\n\n\nConclusions\nLifestyle, individual and structural factors seem to play an important role in influencing the risky sexual behaviours of university students.\n\n Therefore preventive interventions that focus on these factors could be very useful in this sub-population of young people.\n\n This study provides useful baseline information that helps us understand how and why some United Kingdom university students engage in risky sexual behaviours that puts them at risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4203964","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

virus detection.\n\n\nMethods\nWe compared seven published real-time RTPCR assays and two new assays that we have developed.\n\n To determine the analytical sensitivity of each assay, we constructed a synthetic universal control ribonucleic acid (uncRNA) containing all of the assays target regions on one RNA strand and spiked human blood or urine with known quantities of African or Asian Zika virus strains.\n\n Viral loads in 33 samples from Zika virus-infected patients were determined by using one of the new assays.\n\n\nFindings\nOligonucleotides of the published real-time RTPCR assays, showed up to 10 potential mismatches with the Asian lineage causing the current outbreak, compared with 0 to 4 mismatches for the new assays.\n\n The 95% lower detection limit of the seven most sensitive assays ranged from 2.1 to 12.1 uncRNA copies/reaction.\n\n Two assays had lower sensitivities of 17.0 and 1373.3 uncRNA copies/reaction and showed a similar sensitivity when using spiked samples.\n\n The mean viral loads in samples from Zika virus-infected patients were 5??104 RNA copies/mL of blood and 2??104 RNA copies/mL of urine.\n\n\nConclusion\nWe provide reagents and updated protocols for Zika virus detection suitable for the current outbreak strains.\n\n Some published assays might be unsuitable for Zika virus detection, due to the limited sensitivity and potential incompatibility with some strains.\n\n Viral concentrations in the clinical samples were close to the technical detection limit, suggesting that the use of insensitive assays will cause false-negative results.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5153932","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"World Health Organization","authors":[{"firstname":"Victor

severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) during its emergence in humans.\n In spite of intense study, it remains unclear whether the deletion actually reflects adaptation to humans.\n Here we engineered full, partially deleted (?29?nt), and fully deleted ORF8 into a SARS-CoV infectious cDNA clone, strain Frankfurt-1. Replication of the resulting viruses was compared in primate cell cultures as well as Rhinolophus bat cells made permissive for SARS-CoV replication by lentiviral transduction of the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor.\n Cells from cotton rat, goat, and sheep provided control scenarios that represent host systems in which SARS-CoV is neither endemic nor epidemic.\n Independent of the cell system, the truncation of ORF8 (29?nt deletion) decreased replication up to 23-fold.\n The effect was independent of the type I interferon response.\n The 29?nt deletion in SARS-CoV is a deleterious mutation acquired along the initial human-to-human transmission chain.\n The resulting loss of fitness may be due to a founder effect, which has rarely been documented in processes of viral emergence.\n These results have important implications for the retrospective assessment of the threat posed by SARS.\n","id":"PMC6181990","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing Group

infections in adults and children.\n While their clinical representation resembles that of many other agents of the common cold, their evolutionary histories, and host associations could provide important insights into the natural history of past human pandemics.\n For two of these viruses, we have strong evidence suggesting an origin in major livestock species while primordial associations for all four viruses may have existed with bats and rodents.\n HCoV-NL63 and -229E may originate from bat reservoirs as assumed for many other coronaviruses, but HCoV-OC43 and -HKU1 seem more likely to have speciated from rodent-associated viruses.\n HCoV-OC43 is thought to have emerged from ancestors in domestic animals such as cattle or swine.\n The bovine coronavirus has been suggested to be a possible ancestor, from which HCoV-OC43 may have emerged in the context of a pandemic recorded historically at the end of the 19th century.\n New data suggest that HCoV-229E may actually be transferred from dromedary camels similar to Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus.\n This scenario provides important ecological parallels to the present prepandemic pattern of host

We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 490 years (IQR 410580).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 80 days [IQR 50130]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical

(COVID-19) have been produced that differ substantially in magnitude.\n\n We aimed to provide robust estimates, accounting for censoring and ascertainment biases.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected individual-case data for patients who died from COVID-19 in Hubei, mainland China (reported by national and provincial health commissions to Feb 8, 2020), and for cases outside of mainland China (from government or ministry of health websites and media reports for 37 countries, as well as Hong Kong and Macau, until Feb 25, 2020).\n\n These individual-case data were used to estimate the time between onset of symptoms and outcome (death or discharge from hospital).\n\n We next obtained age-stratified estimates of the case fatality ratio by relating the aggregate distribution of cases to the observed cumulative deaths in China, assuming a constant attack rate by age and adjusting for demography and age-based and location-based under-ascertainment.\n\n We also estimated the case fatality ratio from individual line-list data on 1334 cases identified outside of mainland China.\n\n Using data on the prevalence of PCR-confirmed cases in international residents repatriated from China, we obtained age-stratified estimates of the infection fatality ratio.\n\n Furthermore, data on age-stratified severity in a subset of 3665 cases from China were used to estimate the proportion of infected individuals who are likely to require hospitalisation.\n\n\nFindings\nUsing data on 24 deaths that occurred in mainland China and 165 recoveries outside of China, we estimated the mean duration from onset of symptoms to death to be 178 days (95% credible interval [CrI] 169192) and to hospital discharge to be 247 days (229281).\n\n In all laboratory confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases from mainland China (n=70?117), we estimated a crude case fatality ratio (adjusted for censoring) of 367% (95% CrI 356380).\n\n However, after further adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment, we obtained a best estimate of the case fatality ratio in China of 138% (123153), with substantially higher ratios in older age groups (032% [027038] in those aged &lt;60 years vs 64% [5772] in those aged ?60 years), up to 134% (112159) in those aged 80 years or older.\n\n Estimates of case fatality ratio from international cases stratified by age were consistent with those from China (parametric estimate 14% [0435] in those aged &lt;60 years [n=360] and 45% [18111] in those aged ?60 years [n=151]).\n\n Our estimated overall infection fatality ratio for China was 066% (039133), with an increasing profile with age.\n\n Similarly, estimates of the proportion of infected individuals likely to be hospitalised increased with age up to a maximum of 184% (110376) in those aged 80 years or older.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThese early estimates give an indication of the fatality ratio across the spectrum of COVID-19 disease and show a strong age gradient in risk of death.\n\n\nFunding\nUK Medical Research Council.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7158570","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Science ;, The Lancet Pub.

At the same time and separately, the RCGP RSCs surveillance has been extended to monitor the temporal and geographical distribution of COVID-19 infection in the community as well as assess the effectiveness of the containment strategy.\n\n\nObjectives\nThe aims of this study are to surveil COVID-19 in both asymptomatic populations and ambulatory cases with respiratory infections, ascertain both the rate and pattern of COVID-19 spread, and assess the effectiveness of the containment policy.\n\n\nMethods\nThe RCGP RSC, a network of over 500 general practices in England, extract pseudonymized data weekly.\n\n This extended surveillance comprises of five components: (1) Recording in medical records of anyone suspected to have or who has been exposed to COVID-19. Computerized medical records suppliers have within a week of request created new codes to support this.\n\n (2) Extension of current virological surveillance and testing people with influenza-like illness or lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI)with the caveat that people suspected to have or who have been exposed to COVID-19 should be referred to the national containment pathway and not seen in primary care.\n\n (3) Serology sample collection across all age groups.\n\n This will be an extra blood sample taken from people who are attending their general practice for a scheduled blood test.\n\n The 100 general practices currently undertaking annual influenza virology surveillance will be involved in the extended virological and serological surveillance.\n\n (4) Collecting convalescent serum samples.\n\n (5) Data curation.\n\n We have the opportunity to escalate the data extraction to twice weekly if needed.\n\n Swabs and sera will be analyzed in PHE reference laboratories.\n\n\nResults\nGeneral practice clinical system providers have introduced an emergency new set of clinical codes to support COVID-19 surveillance.\n\n Additionally, practices participating in current virology surveillance are now taking samples for COVID-19 surveillance from low-risk patients presenting with LRTIs.\n\n Within the first 2 weeks of setup of this surveillance, we have identified 3 cases: 1 through the new coding system, the other 2 through the extended virology sampling.\n\n\nConclusions\nWe have rapidly converted the established national RCGP RSC influenza surveillance system into one that can test the effectiveness of the COVID-19 containment policy.\n\n The extended surveillance has already seen the use of new codes with 3 cases

We used multivariable logistic regression models with multiple imputation to identify risk factors for positive SARS-CoV-2 tests within this surveillance network.\n\n\nFindings\nWe identified 3802 SARS-CoV-2 test results, of which 587 were positive.\n\n In multivariable analysis, male sex was independently associated with testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (296 [184%] of 1612 men vs 291 [133%] of 2190 women; adjusted odds ratio [OR] 155, 95% CI 127189).\n\n Adults were at increased risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 compared with children, and people aged 4064 years were at greatest risk in the multivariable model (243 [185%] of 1316 adults aged 4064 years vs 23 [46%] of 499 children; adjusted OR 536, 95% CI 328876).\n\n Compared with white people, the adjusted odds of a positive test were greater in black people (388 [155%] of 2497 white people vs 36 [621%] of 58 black people; adjusted OR 475, 95% CI 265851).\n\n People living in urban areas versus rural areas (476 [262%] of 1816 in urban areas vs 111 [56%] of 1986 in rural areas; adjusted OR 459, 95% CI 357590) and in more deprived areas (197 [295%] of 668 in most deprived vs 143 [77%] of 1855 in least deprived; adjusted OR 203, 95% CI 151271) were more likely to test positive.\n\n People with chronic kidney disease were more likely to test positive in the adjusted analysis (68 [329%] of 207 with chronic kidney disease vs 519 [144%] of 3595 without; adjusted OR 191, 95% CI 131278), but there was no significant association with other chronic conditions in that analysis.\n\n We found increased odds of a positive test among people who are obese (142 [209%] of 680 people with obesity vs 171 [132%] of 1296 normal-weight people; adjusted OR 141, 95% CI 104191).\n\n Notably, active smoking was linked with decreased odds of a positive test result (47 [114%] of 413 active smokers vs 201 [179%] of 1125 non-smokers; adjusted OR 049, 95% CI 034071).\n\n\nInterpretation\nA positive SARS-CoV-2 test result in this primary care cohort was associated with similar risk factors as observed for severe outcomes of COVID-19 in hospital settings, except for smoking.\n\n We provide evidence of potential sociodemographic factors associated with a positive test, including deprivation, population density, ethnicity, and chronic kidney disease.\n\n\nFunding\nWellcome Trust.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7228715","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Science ;, The Lancet Pub.

General Practitioners Clinical Informatics Digital Hub: Protocol to Develop Extended COVID-19 Surveillance and Trial Platforms","abstract":"Background\nRoutinely recorded primary care data have been used for many years by sentinel networks for surveillance.\n\n More recently, real world data have been used for a wider range of research projects to support rapid, inexpensive clinical trials.\n\n Because the partial national lockdown in the United Kingdom due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in decreasing community disease incidence, much larger numbers of general practices are needed to deliver effective COVID-19 surveillance and contribute to in-pandemic clinical trials.\n\n\nObjective\nThe aim of this protocol is to describe the rapid design and development of the Oxford Royal College of General Practitioners Clinical Informatics Digital Hub (ORCHID) and its first two platforms.\n\n The Surveillance Platform will provide extended primary care surveillance, while the Trials Platform is a streamlined clinical trials platform that will be integrated into routine primary care practice.\n\n\nMethods\nWe will apply the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) metadata principles to a new, integrated digital health hub that will extract routinely collected general practice electronic health data for use in clinical trials and provide enhanced communicable disease surveillance.\n\n The hub will be findable through membership in Health Data Research UK and European metadata repositories.\n\n Accessibility through an online application system will provide access to study-ready data sets or developed custom data sets.\n\n Interoperability will be facilitated by fixed linkage to other key sources such as Hospital Episodes Statistics and the Office of National Statistics using pseudonymized data.\n\n All semantic descriptors (ie, ontologies) and code used for analysis will be made available to accelerate analyses.\n\n We will also make data available using common data models, starting with the US Food and Drug Administration Sentinel and Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership approaches, to facilitate international studies.\n\n The Surveillance Platform will provide access to data for health protection and promotion work as authorized through agreements between Oxford, the Royal College of General Practitioners, and Public Health England.\n\n All studies using the Trials Platform will go through appropriate ethical and other regulatory approval processes.\n\n\nResults\nThe hub will be a bottom-up, professionally led network that will provide benefits for member practices, our health service, and the population served.\n\n Data will only be used for SQUIRE (surveillance, quality improvement, research, and education) purposes.\n\n We have already received positive responses from practices, and the number of practices in the network has doubled to over 1150 since February 2020. COVID-19 surveillance has resulted in tripling of the number of virology sites to 293 (target 300), which has aided the collection of the largest ever weekly total of surveillance swabs in the United Kingdom as well as over 3000 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) serology samples.\n\n Practices are recruiting to the PRINCIPLE (Platform Randomised trial of INterventions against COVID-19 In older PeopLE) trial, and these participants will be followed up through ORCHID.\n\n These initial outputs demonstrate the feasibility of ORCHID to provide an extended national digital health hub.\n\n\nConclusions\nORCHID will provide equitable and innovative use of big data through a professionally led national primary care network and the application of FAIR principles.\n\n The secure data hub will host routinely collected general practice data linked to other key health care repositories for clinical trials and support enhanced in situ surveillance without always requiring large volume data extracts.\n\n ORCHID will support rapid data extraction, analysis, and dissemination with the aim of improving future research and development in general practice to positively impact patient care.\n\n\nInternational Registered Report Identifier (IRRID)\nDERR1-10.2196/19773\n","id":"PMC7333793","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"JMIR

live corpora to identify new candidate terms for inclusion in the open access and collaborative (OAC) CHV.\n\n\nMethods\nThe CAU system consisted of three main parts: a Web crawler and an HTML parser, a candidate term filter that utilizes natural language processing tools including term recognition methods, and a human review interface.\n\n In evaluation, the CAU system was applied to the health-related social network website PatientsLikeMe.\n\ncom.\n\n The systems utility was assessed by comparing the candidate term list it generated to a list of valid terms hand extracted from the text of the crawled webpages.\n\n\nResults\nThe CAU system identified 88,994 unique terms 1- to 7-grams (n-grams are n consecutive words within a sentence) in 300 crawled PatientsLikeMe.\n\ncom webpages.\n\n The manual review of the crawled webpages identified 651 valid terms not yet included in the OAC CHV or the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Metathesaurus, a collection of vocabularies amalgamated to form an ontology of medical terms, (ie, 1 valid term per 136.7 candidate n-grams).\n\n The term filter selected 774 candidate terms, of which 237 were valid terms, that is,

opportunity to improve public health surveillance.\n In a field that has traditionally relied on an established system of mandatory and voluntary reporting of known infectious diseases by doctors and laboratories to governmental agencies, innovations in social media and so-called user-generated information could lead to faster recognition of cases of infectious disease.\n More direct access to such data could enable surveillance epidemiologists to detect potential public health threats such as rare, new diseases or early-level warnings for epidemics.\n But how useful are data from social media and the Internet, and what is the potential to enhance surveillance? The challenges of using these emerging surveillance systems for infectious disease epidemiology, including the specific resources needed, technical requirements, and acceptability to public health practitioners and policymakers, have wide-reaching implications for public health surveillance in the 21st century.\n","id":"PMC3955375","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Wiley

information in eight languages focused on the epidemiological role of pathogens as well as geographical locations with their latitudes/longitudes.\n The system consists of four main stages: topic classification, named entity recognition (NER), disease/location detection and event recognition.\n Higher order event analysis is used to detect more precisely specified warning signals that can then be notified to registered users via email alerts.\n Evaluation of the system for topic recognition and entity identification is conducted on a gold standard corpus of annotated news

Rubin's rules for combining these multiply imputed estimates are based on asymptotic theory.\n\n The resulting combined estimates may be more accurate if the posterior distribution of the population

dependent on the missingness mechanism and the effect size of missing predictors.\n When the data are MAR, MI can yield comparable forecasting performance but generally requires a larger computational

of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the province.\n\n\nMethods\nEpidemiological data were obtained from the websites of China's Bureau of Health and the People's Government of Jiangsu Province and informal online sources from January 22 to February 20, 2020.\nResults\nThe cumulative number of patients in Jiangsu Province (over 79 million people) was 613. The number of daily confirmed new cases reached the inflection point on January 31 with the maximum of 39 cases.\n\n The temporal number of patients peaked from January 29 to February 9. The proportion of confirmed cases who were residents or travelers to Hubei Province was 100.0%58.8% before January 31 and then gradually declined.\n\n The proportion of close contacts increased gradually from January 27 to February 17. The geographical distribution of COVID-2019 cases showed that all 13 cites reported confirmed new cases after only five days of the first confirmed new case in Suzhou.\n\n The cases were concentrated in Nanjing, Suzhou, and Xuzhou with a high population density (over eight million people).\n\n The epidemiological features of COVID-2019 cases in Wuxi, Jiangsu showed that seven confirmed cases were tourists from others areas beyond Hubei Province.\n\n The longest incubation period of COVID-2019 was 19 days based on the onset of laboratory-confirmed cases.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe number of daily confirmed new cases in Jiangsu Province peaked around January 31 and then declined.\n\n This result emphasized that wartime control measures, such as putting cities on lockdown to limit population

retrospective cohort study","abstract":"Background\nRapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China, prompted heightened surveillance in Shenzhen, China.\n\n The resulting data provide a rare opportunity to measure key metrics of disease course, transmission, and the impact of control measures.\n\n\nMethods\nFrom Jan 14 to Feb 12, 2020, the Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention identified 391 SARS-CoV-2 cases and 1286 close contacts.\n\n We compared cases identified through symptomatic surveillance and contact tracing, and estimated the time from symptom onset to confirmation, isolation, and admission to hospital.\n\n We estimated metrics of disease transmission and analysed factors influencing transmission risk.\n\n\nFindings\nCases were older than the general population (mean age 45 years) and balanced between males (n=187) and females (n=204).\n\n 356 (91%) of 391 cases had mild or moderate clinical severity at initial assessment.\n\n As of Feb 22, 2020, three cases had died and 225 had recovered (median time to recovery 21 days; 95% CI 2022).\n\n Cases were isolated on average 46 days (95% CI 4150) after developing symptoms; contact tracing reduced this by 19 days (95% CI 1127).\n\n Household contacts and those travelling with a case were at higher risk of infection (odds ratio 627 [95% CI 1492633] for household contacts and 706 [1433491] for those travelling with a case) than other close contacts.\n\n The household secondary attack rate was 112% (95% CI 91138), and children were as likely to be infected as adults (infection rate 74% in children &lt;10 years vs population average of 66%).\n\n The observed reproductive number (R) was 04 (95% CI 0305), with a mean serial interval of 63 days (95% CI 5276).\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur data on cases as well as their infected and uninfected close contacts provide key insights into the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. This analysis shows that isolation and contact tracing reduce the time during which cases are infectious in the community, thereby reducing the R.\n\n The overall impact of isolation and contact tracing, however, is uncertain and highly dependent on the number of asymptomatic cases.\n\n Moreover, children are at a similar risk of infection to the general population, although less likely to have severe symptoms; hence they should be considered in analyses of transmission and control.\n\n\nFunding\nEmergency Response Program of Harbin Institute of Technology, Emergency Response Program of Peng Cheng Laboratory, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7185944","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Qifang","surname":"Bi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yongsheng","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shujiang","surname":"Mei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chenfei","surname":"Ye","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuan","surname":"Zou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhen","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaojian","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lan","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shaun A","surname":"Truelove","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tong","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Cong","surname":"Cheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiujuan","surname":"Tang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoliang","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yu","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Binbin","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Suli","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yu","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Juncen","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Ma","email":"tma@hit.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Justin","surname":"Lessler","email":"justin@jhu.edu","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tiejian","surname":"Feng","email":"fengtiej@126.com","contributions":"0"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Early transmission dynamics in Wuhan, China, of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical characteristics of 138 hospitalized patients with 2019 novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1101/2020.02.10.20021675","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Epidemiological and clinical features of the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak in China","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) situation reports","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.7326/M20-0504","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The Incubation Period of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) From Publicly Reported Confirmed Cases: Estimation and Application","abstract":"Background:\nA novel human coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified in China in December 2019. There is limited support for many of its key epidemiologic features, including the incubation period for clinical disease (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]), which has important implications for surveillance and control activities.\n\n\nObjective:\nTo estimate the length of the incubation period of COVID-19 and describe its public health implications.\n\n\nDesign:\nPooled analysis of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported between 4 January 2020 and 24 February 2020.\nSetting:\nNews reports and press releases from 50 provinces, regions, and countries outside Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n\n\nParticipants:\nPersons with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection outside Hubei province, China.\n\n\nMeasurements:\nPatient demographic characteristics and dates and times of possible exposure, symptom onset, fever onset, and hospitalization.\n\n\nResults:\nThere were 181 confirmed cases with identifiable exposure and symptom onset windows to estimate the incubation period of COVID-19. The median incubation period was estimated to be 5.1 days (95% CI, 4.5 to 5.8 days), and 97.5% of those who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days (CI, 8.2 to 15.6 days) of infection.\n\n These estimates imply that, under conservative assumptions, 101 out of every 10000 cases (99th percentile, 482) will develop symptoms after 14 days of active monitoring or quarantine.\n\n\nLimitation:\nPublicly reported cases may overrepresent severe cases, the incubation period for which may differ from that of mild cases.\n\n\nConclusion:\nThis work provides additional evidence for a median incubation period for COVID-19 of approximately 5 days, similar to SARS.\n\n Our results support current proposals for the length of quarantine or active monitoring of persons potentially exposed to SARS-CoV-2, although longer monitoring periods might be justified in extreme cases.\n\n\nPrimary Funding Source:\nU.\n\nS.\n\n Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institute of General Medical Sciences, and Alexander von Humboldt Foundation.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7081172","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"American College of Physicians","authors":[{"firstname":"Stephen A.","surname":"Lauer","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kyra H.","surname":"Grantz","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qifang","surname":"Bi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Forrest K.","surname":"Jones","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qulu","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hannah R.","surname":"Meredith","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Andrew S.","surname":"Azman","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nicholas G.","surname":"Reich","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Justin","surname":"Lessler","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Incubation period of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infections among travellers from Wuhan, China, 20-28 January 2020","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Outbreak of 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) at a New York City school","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Transmission dynamics and control of severe acute respiratory syndrome","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Estimating the severity and subclinical burden of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Analysis of coarsely observed data [R package coarseDataTools version 0 6-5].

characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7092819","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical Society","authors":[{"firstname":"Wei-jie","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng-yi","surname":"Ni","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng-yi","surname":"Ni","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yu","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wen-hua","surname":"Liang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chun-quan","surname":"Ou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jian-xing","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Shan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chun-liang","surname":"Lei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"David S.C.","surname":"Hui","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Du","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lan-juan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guang","surname":"Zeng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kwok-Yung","surname":"Yuen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ru-chong","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chun-li","surname":"Tang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tao","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ping-yan","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jie","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shi-yue","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jin-lin","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zi-jing","surname":"Liang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi-xiang","surname":"Peng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Li","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ya-hua","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Peng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jian-ming","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ji-yang","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhong","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gang","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhi-jian","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shao-qin","surname":"Qiu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jie","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chang-jiang","surname":"Ye","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shao-yong","surname":"Zhu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nan-shan","surname":"Zhong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical features predicting mortality risk in patients with viral pneumonia: the MuLBSTA Score","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical courses and outcomes of hospitalized adult patients with seasonal influenza in Korea, 2011-2012: Hospital-based Influenza Morbidity &amp;

about the health sequelae of pneumonia in persons with chronic kidney disease (CKD).\n\n\nMethods\nWe studied adults with CKD in Stockholm during 200611, who not previously been diagnosed with lower respiratory tract infections.\n\n We used multivariable-adjusted Cox regression with pneumonia as a time-varying exposure to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) [95% confidence intervals (CIs)] for the events of death, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), acute kidney injury (AKI), CKD progression or hospitalization for urinary tract infections (UTIs)/sepsis.\n\n Cataract and knee/joint replacement served as negative control outcomes.\n\n\nResults\nWe identified 71931 adults (mean age 79?years, 59% women), of whom 8379 (12%) were diagnosed with pneumonia during follow-up; incident pneumonia was associated with 10 times higher adjusted mortality risk during the first 90?days [HR = 10.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 9.510.5] and double the mortality beyond 90?days from pneumonia diagnosis (HR = 2.0; 95% CI 1.92.1).\n\n Incident pneumonia was similarly associated with higher adjusted risk of MACE (&lt;90?days: HR = 12.6; 95% CI 12.013.3; ?90?days: HR = 1.5; 95% CI 1.41.6).\n\n The adjusted risk of CKD progression and UTI/sepsis hospitalization was highest within 90?days from pneumonia but remained elevated thereafter.\n\n For AKI, the association with incident pneumonia was only seen within 90?days.\n\n Neither cataract nor knee/joint replacement was related to pneumonia.\n\n\nConclusions\nIncident pneumonia was associated with increased risks of MACE, CKD progression, severe UTI/sepsis and death, with risks highest soon after pneumonia diagnosis but extending beyond 90?days.\n\n Our findings highlight the susceptibility for adverse outcomes of CKD patients following pneumonia diagnosis, and may inform clinical decisions regarding vaccination strategies.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7643674","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Oxford University

By extracting and analyzing all available published clinical data, we identified several major clinical characteristics associated with increased disease severity and mortality among patients with COVID-19. Specifically, preexisting chronic conditions such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes are strongly associated with an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19; surprisingly, however, we found no correlation between chronic liver disease and increased disease severity.\n In addition, we found that both acute cardiac injury and acute kidney injury are highly correlated with an increased risk of COVID-19-related mortality.\n Given the high risk of comorbidity and the high mortality rate associated with tissue damage, organ function should be monitored closely in patients diagnosed with COVID-19, and this approach should be included when establishing new guidelines for managing these high-risk patients.\n Moreover, additional clinical data are needed in order to determine whether a supportive therapy can help mitigate the development of severe, potentially fatal complications, and further studies are needed to identify the pathophysiology and the mechanism underlying this novel coronavirus-associated infectious disease.\n Taken together, these findings provide new insights regarding clinical strategies for improving the management and outcome of patients with COVID-19.","id":"PMC7187729","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"AAAS","authors":[{"firstname":"Xinhui","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuexian","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuexian","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhaoxian","surname":"Cai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhaoxian","surname":"Cai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaotian","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaotong","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaotong","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Junxia","surname":"Min","email":"junxiamin@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Junxia","surname":"Min","email":"junxiamin@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fudi","surname":"Wang","email":"fwang@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fudi","surname":"Wang","email":"fwang@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2002032","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China","abstract":"Background\nSince December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and

2019 (Covid-19) has not been well studied.\n\n\nMethods\nWe carried out a population-based casecontrol study in the Lombardy region of Italy.\n\n A total of 6272 case patients in whom infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was confirmed between February 21 and March 11, 2020, were matched to 30,759 beneficiaries of the Regional Health Service (controls) according to sex, age, and municipality of residence.\n\n Information about the use of selected drugs and patients clinical profiles was obtained from regional databases of health care use.\n\n Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for associations between drugs and infection, with adjustment for confounders, were estimated by means of logistic regression.\n\n\nResults\nAmong both case patients and controls, the mean (SD) age was 6813 years, and 37% were women.\n\n The use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs was more common among case patients than among controls, as was the use of other antihypertensive and non-antihypertensive drugs, and case patients had a worse clinical profile.\n\n Use of ARBs or ACE inhibitors did not show any association with Covid-19 among case patients overall (adjusted odds ratio, 0.95 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.86 to 1.05] for ARBs and 0.96 [95% CI, 0.87 to 1.07] for ACE inhibitors) or among patients who had a severe or fatal course of the disease (adjusted odds ratio, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.63 to 1.10] for ARBs and 0.91 [95% CI, 0.69 to 1.21] for ACE inhibitors), and no association between these variables was found according to sex.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn this large, population-based study, the use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs was more frequent among patients with Covid-19 than among controls because of their higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease.\n\n However, there was no evidence that ACE inhibitors or ARBs affected the risk of COVID-19.\n","id":"PMC7206933","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical

inhibitors might influence the severity of COVID-19. We aimed to evaluate whether continuing versus discontinuing reninangiotensin system inhibitors (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers) affects outcomes in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19.\nMethods\nThe REPLACE COVID trial was a prospective, randomised, open-label trial done at 20 large referral hospitals in seven countries worldwide.\n\n Eligible participants were aged 18 years and older who were admitted to hospital with COVID-19 and were receiving a reninangiotensin system inhibitor before admission.\n\n Individuals with contraindications to continuation or discontinuation of reninangiotensin system inhibitor therapy were excluded.\n\n Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to continuation or discontinuation of their reninangiotensin system inhibitor using permuted block randomisation, with allocation concealed using a secure web-based randomisation system.\n\n The primary outcome was a global rank score in which participants were ranked across four hierarchical tiers incorporating time to death, duration of mechanical ventilation, time on renal replacement or vasopressor therapy, and multiorgan dysfunction during the hospitalisation.\n\n Primary analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population.\n\n The REPLACE COVID trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.\n\ngov, NCT04338009.\n\n\nFindings\nBetween March 31 and Aug 20, 2020, 152 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to either continue or discontinue reninangiotensin system inhibitor therapy (continuation group n=75; discontinuation group n=77).\n\n Mean age of participants was 62 years (SD 12), 68 (45%) were female, mean body-mass index was 33 kg/m2 (SD 8), and 79 (52%) had diabetes.\n\n Compared with discontinuation of reninangiotensin system inhibitors, continuation had no effect on the global rank score (median rank 73 [IQR 40110] for continuation vs 81 [38117] for discontinuation; ?-coefficient 8 [95% CI ?13 to 29]).\n\n There were 16 (21%) of 75 participants in the continuation arm versus 14 (18%) of 77 in the discontinuation arm who required intensive care unit admission or invasive mechanical ventilation, and 11 (15%) of 75 participants in the continuation group versus ten (13%) of 77 in the discontinuation group died.\n\n 29 (39%) participants in the continuation group and 28 (36%) participants in the discontinuation group had at least one adverse event (?2 test of adverse events between treatment groups p=077).\n\n There was no difference in blood pressure, serum potassium, or creatinine during follow-up across the two groups.\n\n\nInterpretation\nConsistent with international society recommendations, reninangiotensin system inhibitors can be safely continued in patients admitted to hospital

They were randomized in two groups.\n\n The former dosage of ACEis/ARBs was continued in one group while in another group, the ACEis/ARBs were replaced by amlodipine  carvedilol according to the dose equivalents.\n\n The primary outcomes were length of stay in hospitals and intensive care units.\n\n Other outcomes include mechanical ventilation, non-invasive ventilation, readmission, and COVID-19 symptoms after discharge.\n\n\nResults\n We randomized 64 patients with COVID-19 into two groups.\n\n Most patients were aged 66-80 and 46-65 years-old, 33 (51.6%) and 27 (42.2%), respectively.\n\n The study groups were nearly similar in baseline vital signs and characteristics.\n\n In addition, there was no significant difference in terms of recorded systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements between groups.\n\n Furthermore, we did not find a significant difference between the days of intensive care unit or ward admission, the discharge rate, or readmission rates between the two groups.\n\n\nConclusions\n This randomized triple-blind multi-centric clinical trial did not show any deleterious effects of ACEi/ARB medications in hypertensive COVID-19 patients.\n\n\n","id":"PMC8344947","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Oxford University Press","authors":[{"firstname":"Farhad","surname":"Najmeddin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Maedeh","surname":"Solhjoo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Haleh","surname":"Ashraf","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mohammadreza","surname":"Salehi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fatemeh","surname":"Rasooli","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Morteza","surname":"Ghoghaei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Abbas","surname":"Soleimani","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Maryam","surname":"Bahreini","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1002/sim.5984","date":"2013-09-03","title":"The use of propensity score methods with survival or time-to-event outcomes: reporting measures of effect similar to those used in randomized experiments","abstract":"Propensity score methods are increasingly being used to estimate causal treatment effects in observational studies.\n In medical and epidemiological studies, outcomes are frequently time-to-event in nature.\n Propensity-score methods are often applied incorrectly when estimating the effect of treatment on time-to-event outcomes.\n This article describes how two different propensity score methods (matching and inverse probability of treatment weighting) can be used to estimate the measures of effect that are frequently reported in randomized controlled trials: (i) marginal survival curves, which describe survival in the population if all subjects were treated or if all subjects were untreated; and (ii) marginal hazard ratios.\n The use of these propensity score methods allows one to replicate the measures of effect that are commonly reported in randomized controlled trials with time-to-event outcomes: both absolute and relative reductions in the probability of an event occurring can be determined.\n We also provide guidance on variable selection for the propensity score model, highlight methods for assessing the balance of baseline covariates between treated and untreated subjects, and describe the implementation of a sensitivity analysis to assess the effect of unmeasured confounding variables on the estimated treatment effect when outcomes are time-to-event in nature.\n The methods in the paper are illustrated by estimating the effect of discharge statin prescribing on the risk of death in a sample of patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction.\n In this tutorial article, we describe and illustrate all the steps necessary to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the effect of treatment on time-to-event outcomes.\n  2013 The authors.\n Statistics in Medicine published by John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.\n","id":"PMC4285179","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BlackWell Publishing Ltd","authors":[{"firstname":"Peter C","surname":"Austin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1093/eurheartj/ehs114","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Do observational studies using propensity score methods agree with randomized trials?

severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was confirmed between February 21 and March 11, 2020, were matched to 30,759 beneficiaries of the Regional Health Service (controls) according to sex, age, and municipality of residence.\n\n Information about the use of selected drugs and patients clinical profiles was obtained from regional databases of health care use.\n\n Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for associations between drugs and infection, with adjustment for confounders, were estimated by means of logistic regression.\n\n\nResults\nAmong both case patients and controls, the mean (SD) age was 6813 years, and 37% were women.\n\n The use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs was more common among case patients than among controls, as was the use of other

December 2019, the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has rapidly spread and overwhelmed healthcare systems worldwide, urging physicians to understand how to manage this novel infection.\n Early in the pandemic, more severe forms of COVID-19 have been observed in patients with cardiovascular comorbidities, who are often treated with renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS)-blockers, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), but whether these are indeed independent risk factors is unknown.\n The cellular receptor for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the membrane-bound angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), as for SARS-CoV(-1).\n Experimental data suggest that expression of ACE2 may be increased by RAAS-blockers, raising concerns that these drugs may facilitate viral cell entry.\n On the other hand, ACE2 is a key counter-regulator of the RAAS, by degrading angiotensin II into angiotensin (1-7), and may thereby mediate beneficial effects in COVID-19. These considerations have raised concerns about the management of these drugs, and early comments shed vivid controversy among physicians.\n This review will describe the homeostatic balance between ACE-angiotensin II and ACE2-angiotensin (1-7) and summarize the pathophysiological rationale underlying the debated role of the RAAS and its modulators in the context of the pandemic.\n In addition, we will review available evidence investigating the impact of RAAS blockers on the course and prognosis of COVID-19 and discuss why retrospective observational studies should be interpreted with caution.\n These considerations highlight the importance of solid evidence-based data in order to guide physicians in the management of RAAS-interfering drugs in the general population as well as in patients with more or less severe forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n","id":"PMC7937723","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Frontiers Media S.A.","authors":[{"firstname":"Simon B.","surname":"Gressens","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Georges","surname":"Leftheriotis","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jean-Claude","surname":"Dussaule","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Martin","surname":"Flamant","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Bernard I.","surname":"Levy","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Emmanuelle","surname":"Vidal-Petiot","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.ejim.2021.09.007","date":"2021-09-14","title":"The pivotal link between ACE2 deficiency and SARS-CoV-2 infection: One year later","abstract":"","id":"PMC8450306","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"European Federation of Internal Medicine.

ACE2 receptors are ubiquitous and widely expressed in the heart, vessels, gut, lung (particularly in type 2 pneumocytes and macrophages), kidney, testis and brain.\n ACE2 is mostly bound to cell membranes and only scarcely present in the circulation in a soluble form.\n An important salutary function of membrane-bound and soluble ACE2 is the degradation of angiotensin II to angiotensin1-7.\n Consequently, ACE2 receptors limit several detrimental effects resulting from binding of angiotensin II to AT1 receptors, which include vasoconstriction, enhanced inflammation and thrombosis.\n The increased generation of angiotensin1-7 also triggers counter-regulatory protective effects through binding to G-protein coupled Mas receptors.\n Unfortunately, the entry of SARS-CoV2 into the cells through membrane fusion markedly down-regulates ACE2 receptors, with loss of the catalytic effect of these receptors at the external site of the membrane.\n Increased pulmonary inflammation and coagulation have been reported as unwanted effects of enhanced and unopposed angiotensin II effects via the ACE?Angiotensin II?AT1 receptor axis.\n Clinical reports of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 show that several features associated with infection and severity of the disease (i.\ne.\n, older age, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease) share a variable degree of ACE2 deficiency.\n We suggest that ACE2 down-regulation induced by viral invasion may be especially detrimental in people with baseline ACE2 deficiency associated with the above conditions.\n The additional ACE2 deficiency after viral invasion might amplify the dysregulation between the adverse ACE?Angiotensin II?AT1 receptor axis and the protective ACE2?Angiotensin1-7?Mas receptor axis.\n In the lungs, such dysregulation would favor the progression of inflammatory and thrombotic processes triggered by local angiotensin II hyperactivity unopposed by angiotensin1-7.\n In this setting, recombinant ACE2, angiotensin1-7 and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers could be promising therapeutic approaches in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n","id":"PMC7167588","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"European Federation of Internal Medicine.

This includes patients with hypertension, heart disease, diabetes mellitus, and clearly the elderly.\n Many of those patients are treated with renin-angiotensin system blockers.\n Because the ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) protein is the receptor that facilitates coronavirus entry into cells, the notion has been popularized that treatment with renin-angiotensin system blockers might increase the risk of developing a severe and fatal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection.\n The present article discusses this concept.\n ACE2 in its full-length form is a membrane-bound enzyme, whereas its shorter (soluble) form circulates in blood at very low levels.\n As a mono-carboxypeptidase, ACE2 contributes to the degradation of several substrates including angiotensins I and II.\n ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors do not inhibit ACE2 because ACE and ACE2 are different enzymes.\n Although angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers have been shown to upregulate ACE2 in experimental animals, the evidence is not always consistent and differs among the diverse angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers and differing organs.\n Moreover, there are no data to support the notion that ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker administration facilitates coronavirus entry by increasing ACE2 expression in either animals or humans.\n Indeed, animal data support elevated ACE2 expression as conferring potential protective pulmonary and cardiovascular effects.\n In summary, based on the currently available evidence, treatment with renin-angiotensin system blockers should not be discontinued because of concerns with coronavirus infection.\n","id":"PMC7225046","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Lippincott, Williams &amp; Wilkins","authors":[{"firstname":"A.H.

novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 490 years (IQR 410580).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 80 days [IQR 50130]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and

urgent threat to global health.\n This study was conducted to provide the international community with a deeper understanding of this new infectious disease.\n Epidemiological, clinical features, laboratory findings, radiological characteristics, treatment, and clinical outcomes of 135 patients in northeast Chongqing were collected and analyzed in this study.\n A total of 135 hospitalized patients with COVID?19 were enrolled.\n The median age was 47 years (interquartile range, 36?55), and there was no significant gender difference (53.3% men).\n The majority of patients had contact with people from the Wuhan area.\n Forty?three (31.9%) patients had underlying disease, primarily hypertension (13 [9.6%]), diabetes (12 [8.9%]), cardiovascular disease (7 [5.2%]), and malignancy (4 [3.0%]).\n Common symptoms included fever (120 [88.9%]), cough (102 [76.5%]), and fatigue (44 [32.5%]).\n Chest computed tomography scans showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs of all the patients.\n All patients received antiviral therapy (135 [100%]) (Kaletra and interferon were both used), antibacterial therapy (59 [43.7%]), and corticosteroids (36 [26.7%]).\n In addition, many patients received traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) (124 [91.8%]).\n It is suggested that patients should receive Kaletra early and should be treated by a combination of Western and Chinese medicines.\n Compared to the mild cases, the severe ones had lower lymphocyte counts and higher plasma levels of Pt, APTT, d?dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, PCT, ALB, C?reactive protein, and aspartate aminotransferase.\n This study demonstrates the clinic features and therapies of 135 COVID?19 patients.\n Kaletra and TCM played an important role in the treatment of the viral pneumonia.\n

Pathways in the MMPs Activation and Progression of Lung Injury Induced by Cigarette Smoke Exposure in ACE2 Knockout Mice","abstract":"Inflammation-mediated abnormalities in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are implicated in the pathogenesis of lung injury.\n Angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2), an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) homologue that displays antagonist effects on ACE/angiotensin II (Ang II) axis, could also play a protective role against lung diseases.\n However, the relationship between ACE2 and MMPs activation in lung injury is still largely unclear.\n The purpose of this study is to investigate whether MMPs activity could be affected by ACE2 and which ACE2 derived signaling pathways could be also involved via using a mouse model with lung injury induced by cigarette smoke (CS) exposure for 1 to 3 weeks.\n Wild-type (WT; C57BL/6) and ACE2 KO mice (ACE2-/-) were utilized to study CS-induced lung injury.\n Increases in the resting respiratory rate (RRR), pulmonary immunokines, leukocyte infiltration and bronchial hyperplasia were observed in the CS-exposed mice.\n Compared to WT mice, more serious physiopathological changes were found in ACE2-/- mice in the first week of CS exposure.\n CS exposure increased pulmonary ACE and ACE2 activities in WT mice, and significantly increased ACE in ACE2-/- mice.\n Furthermore, the activity of pulmonary MMPs was decreased in CS-exposed WT mice, whereas this activity was increased in ACE2-/- mice.\n CS exposure increased the pulmonary p-p38, p-JNK and p-ERK1/2 level in all mice.\n In ACE2-/- mice, a significant increase p-STAT3 signaling was detected; however, no effect was observed on the p-STAT3 level in WT mice.\n Our results support the hypothesis that ACE2 deficiency influences MMPs activation and STAT3 phosphorylation signaling to promote more pulmonary inflammation in the development of lung
