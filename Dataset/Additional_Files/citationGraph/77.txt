Fall prevention programs have been implemented in various forms. The Otago exercise program (OEP) is one of the most recent home-base exercise training program.\nObjectives\nThis study was conducted to examine the effectiveness of OEP to reduce falls among elderly people in Shahroud, IR Iran.\nMaterials and Methods\nThis randomised control trial was conducted among the elderly community dwellers in Shahroud city of the Semnan province, IR Iran, with experience of falls in the last 12 months. Subjects of the study (n = 317) were recruited from elderly senior citizens at public health centers. Block systematic random sampling was applied to categorize the subjects in experimental and control groups. The experimental group (n = 160) received OEP for six months and was compared with the control group (n = 157) who received general health training. This study was registered with the following ID, IRCT2014012016285N1.\nResults\nThe findings of the study showed that OEP improved physical performance (Berg-Balance-Score with P &gt; 0.025, and Timed-Up-Go-Test with P &gt; 0.017) and functional capacity (Arm-Curl-Test with P &gt; 0.00 and Chair-Stand-Test with P &gt; 0.01). In addition, OEP significantly reduced the incidence of falls (P &lt;= 0.00) among senior citizens in the experimental group.\nDiscussion\nThe OEP as a home-based exercise is effective for the reduction of the incidence of falls among senior citizens with a history of falls. The OEP can be recommended for elderly homebound people who do not have access to facilities.\n1. Background\nFall is a worldwide health problem among elderly people. Approximately 30% of community dwellers aged 65 and older fall annually. Falls are not only associated with morbidity and mortality in the older population, but are also linked to poorer overall functioning, low quality of life and early admission to hospitals and long term care facilities.\nFall prevention programs have been implemented in various forms. However, most of the previous fall prevention programs are costly and require a lot of time and effort. Moreover, they are implemented by trained personnel at luxurious settings. This means that public availability of most programs is not possible. Researchers have applied different approaches and strategies to prevent falls among vulnerable elderly people in the community. To meet this public need, the necessity for a home-base exercise program has been proposed by some researchers. For those homebound elderly, application of a home-based exercise training can be an alternative option to prevent falls. Therefore, there is growing attention towards the application of home-based exercise programs for the elderly.\nDespite obvious advantages of home-base exercise programs, surprisingly, only a few randomized controlled intervention studies on falls have investigated the effects of home-base training intervention for community-dwelling elderly. In addition, there have been some drawbacks in previous home-base programs. Most previous home-base interventions still rely on expert personnel who closely supervise their clients and provide them with high standard care at their homes. The Otago Exercise Program (OEP) is one of the most recent home-based exercise training programs. The OEP was first introduced in New Zealand. The program is a strength and balance retraining program, combined with walking, known as the OEP. The program was designed for three times a week and progressed over time. Four randomized controlled trials, with different settings and timings, disclosed the effects of the program on the elderly.\nThe first Otago trial addressed female elderly community dwellers, over the age of 80, who were grouped in exercise and control groups. Physiotherapists who were responsible to attend four home visits over the first two months conducted this OEP. They scheduled the program for 30-minute sessions to be conducted three times a week, plus walking outside the home three times a week. For monitoring purposes, regular telephone contacts were done. In the control group, usual home visits were done and usual home visit care was provided for the clients. The results showed that there was no significant difference between the control and experimental groups in Instrumental Activity of Daily Life (IADL) or the physical self-maintenance scale.\nIn the second trial of the OEP, researchers continued telephone contacts to motivate the subjects in the experimental group to keep up the program. At this time, the researcher merely measured incidence of falls, falls-induced injuries and subjects' compliance to the exercise program. According to the results of this study, 44% of the subjects continued the program for two-years. They reported significant reduction in the incidence of falls, although the rate of falls in the first and second year in experimental group was unchanged. One of recommendations of this trial was a booster home visit at the end of the sixth month. In the third and fourth trials, the OEP was altered to a different model and researchers tried to look at the cost-effectiveness of the program. At this stage the program was delivered by trained district nurses, and also included male senior citizens. Moreover, they included subjects of 75 years old and over. The content of the exercise program was intact, yet they increased the home visits frequency to weeks one, two, four and eight. Moreover, they planned a booster visit at the end of the sixth month. The results of the study revealed that the OEP is beneficial for elderly people. The program failed to decrease the rate of falls in elderly people under 80; however, it successfully reduced the rate of falls among the elderly community dwellers 80 years old and above. Moreover, the researchers concluded that the OEP can be cost-effective, especially if trained practice nurses conduct the program.\n2. Objectives\nDespite growing application of OEP, it has not been applied and tested in Middle East countries. The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of OEP to reduce falls among community elderly dwellers in Shahroud city of the Semnan province, IR Iran.\n3. Materials and Methods\nThis study was a randomised clinical trial conducted on senior citizens living in Shahroud, IR Iran. Figure 1 shows the flow chart of the study.\nFlow Chart of the Study\n3.1. Sampling\nBlock random sampling was applied to assign participants into experimental and control groups. In this multicenter study, each public health center was randomly assigned as control or experimental blocks. All subjects at each health center were allocated to control or experimental groups based on their allocated health centers. This prevented data contamination between subjects in the control and experimental groups.\nThe researchers planned to have at least 150 subjects in each of the control and experimental groups based on the sample size calculation formula. To estimate a sample size for a proportion in a study, three numbers are needed; estimate of the expected proportion (p), desired level of absolute precision (d), and confidence level (e.g. 1.96 for 95% confidence level) (Z).\nThe sample size formula is presented below:\nThe inclusion criteria were as follow. All subjects were 60 years old and above, able to walk at least 10 meters long, had permanent residency in an urban area in the last 12 months and had previous experience of falls. Moreover, they had a female family member (to maintain homogeneity) as a caregiver (aged 18 - 50) who had health literacy. Health literacy was tested by reading an instructional booklet and explaining the content to the researchers. \nExclusion criteria were acute or chronic disease, which may restrict exercise for subjects. A physician's approval letter was filled by GPs working at the district health centers. Other reasons for exclusion from the study were being unable to walk independently for 10 m, having previous hip replacement surgery or previous history of lower extremities fracture in the last 12 months, severe articular involvement limiting physical activity and recommendations discouraging participation for any reason by an orthopedic surgeon. In addition, elderly people with high vigorous level of activity in the last 12 months were excluded from the study.\nIn this study, 12,315 elderly individuals were registered at district health centers, under the health services of Shahroud Medical University (SHMU), IR Iran, from January 2012 to January 2013. Of all registered elderly people, 2,223 subjects attended the district health centers and were interviewed and examined by GPs. However, 1,772 subjects were excluded for different reasons, such as being unwilling to participate in the project, which was either the decision of the client (n = 461) or their caregivers (n = 284), having experience of vigorous activity during the last 12 months (n = 13), not having an eligible caregiver (n = 573), suffering from an acute disease or not approved to participate in the exercise training by the panel doctor (n = 441). The final number of subjects who were selected to participate in the program was 451.\nThe number of subjects in both groups who rejected to complete the program at any stage of the program was 144 individuals, of whom 115 were from the experimental group and 119 were from the control group. The total number of subjects who participated in the study for six months was 157 individuals in the control group and 160 in the experimental group, giving a total number of 317 elderly people.\nTo recruit and train the executive team, public health Deputy of Dean at SHMU, mobilized general practitioners, nurses and chief health officers in all district health centers participated in a workshop on &quot;Fall in Elderly&quot;. The workshop was run by the same instructor and a package of instructions was provided for the participants. The package included a CD with video clips to instruct on how to do all the clinical exams and interview with the clients and how to fill up the forms and questionnaires. All medical tests were performed by a GP, blinded about the program and subjects in both groups. The inter-rater reliability between the two examiners with the same knowledge and skills was conducted and revealed strong reliability (r = 0.94).\nSubjects in the experimental group received the OEP for six months in the presence of their family caregivers. All training sessions were held at the client's home. In addition to face-to-face education, participants were given a pictorial booklet of all training exercises. They were instructed on how to use the training booklet. A flexible timetable (based on participants' preference) in a logbook was arranged for the subjects to allocate 45 to 60 minutes for exercise three times a week. Each OEP session consisted of a five- to ten-minute warm-up, 30- to 40-minute strength training, and five- to ten-minute cool-down training. They were instructed to strictly follow sequences of the training as warm up, exercise and cool down. In order to confirm accuracy of the participants and caregivers performance (monitoring and recording), an orientation session and regular home visits (once a month) were planned. The control group received a booklet on general health for elderly people published by the &quot;Iranian Ministry of Health, Treatment and Medical Education&quot;. All participants' family members were allowed to call the researcher during the programme to ask their questions. In addition, the researcher called them frequently to assure if they are using their booklet properly.\n3.2. Ethics\nThe proposal of this study was approved and supervised by the research committee and medical ethic committee of Shahroud University of Medical Sciences. In addition, this randomized control trial was registered with the following ID, IRCT2014012016285N1. All participants, elderly people and their family caregivers, filled the informed consent. They were visited by a panel of doctors to approve safety of training for their clients. Participants were encouraged to call their doctors or researcher in case of any query. Moreover, they were assured that any injury during pre and post-tests at the rehabilitation center would be supported by the university hospital. Moreover, they were assured that all the information would be kept confidential and would not be revealed unless for research purposes and in an anonymous form. Participants were allowed to decline participation at any stage of research, yet they were not allowed to switch from either group to another.\n3.3. Study Intervention\nThis study followed the standard OEP to prevent falls. The Otago university formally validated and approved the study to be conducted in Iran via email. The procedure started with five-minute gentle warm up, continued by 30- to 45-minute exercise activity and finished with a 5 - 10 minute cool down exercise. The exercise protocol included strengthening and balance exercises.\n3.4. Measurement Outcomes\nDemographic characteristics' of the subjects were collected from their health records at the health centers. The outcome measures included &quot;functional capacity&quot;, &quot;physical performance&quot; and &quot;incidence of falls&quot;. All these outcome variables were examined before and after the exercise training program. The functional capacity included, the Berg balance scale (BBS) and the timed up and go test (TUGT). Chair stand test (CST) and arm curl test (ACT) assessed physical performance for each subject.\n3.5. Berg Balance Scale\nThe BBS contains 14 static and dynamic activities (e.g. transfers, standing unsupported and sit-to-stand) and more difficult tasks (e.g. tandem standing, turning 360  and single-leg stance). For scoring, a five-point scale, ranging from 0 - 4 was used. Zero indicated the lowest level of function and four indicated the highest level of function. The total score varied between 0 and 56. In interpretation of BBS, three levels of low, medium and high risk of falls were categorized. Low risk of falls corresponded to scores 41 to 56; medium risk of falls corresponded to scores 21 to 40 and high risk of falls corresponded to scores 0 to 20.\n3.6. Timed Up and Go Test\nThe TUGT measures the individual's ability to stand up from a standard arm chair, walk a three-meter distance in a flat direction, then turn back and walk to the chair, and sit down in seconds. A client with normal ability is expected to accomplish the task in less than 12 seconds. A longer time needed to finish the test is considered as impaired TUGT results. The client is instructed to start with the following sentence; &quot;When I say 'go' I want you to stand up and walk to the line, turn and then walk back to the chair and sit down again. Walk at your normal pace&quot;.\n3.7. Chair Stand Test\nThe Chair Stand Test, or 30 seconds Chair Stand Test, is a physical performance test used to assess the clients' lower-extremity function, which has been shown to predict subsequent development of disability, because it reflects the effects of chronic disease, coexisting conditions and overall physiologic decline. A five-repetition test is a measure of strength while a ten-repetition test is a measure of strength and endurance.\n3.8. Arm Curl Test\nThe ACT is used to measure upper extremity strength, which is assessed by the number of times a weight (0.5 Kg for females and 1 Kg for males) can be lifted (on their dominant hand) in a 30-second time period. The goal of this test is to have the client to perform as many biceps muscle curls as possible in 30 seconds. This test should be performed on the dominant arm side (or stronger side). The subject sits on the chair, holding the weight in their hand using a suitcase grip (palm facing towards the body) with their arm in a vertically down position beside the chair. The upper arm against the body should be immobilized, so that only the lower arm is moving. Interpretation of the test differs based on sex and age category of the subjects. The results are reported as below average, average and above average.\n3.9. Statistical Analysis\nTo analyze the data, the SPSS version 21 was applied. Descriptive and inferential statistics were performed by the SPSS software, and the mean, standard deviation, and frequency of variables were obtained. Moreover, t-Test and x2 were applied in inferential statistical methods. Statistical significance was determined at &lt; 0.05. Normality of the results was tested by skewness of +- 1, indicating that all results were normally distributed.\n4. Results\nThe baseline characteristics of the subjects of the study are summarized in Table 1. It presents the mean (M) and standard deviation (SD) baseline assessment of the 317 subjects in both control (n = 157) and experimental (n = 160) groups. Moreover, the t value, degree of freedom (df) and significance level for comparison of values of control and experimental groups are shown in Table 1.\n Comparative Characteristics of Subjects in the Control and Experimental Groups\nVariables	Control (n = 157)	Experimental (n = 160)	t	df	P Value	 	Age 	70.06 +- 5.20	70.60 +- 5.80	-0.88	315	.382	 	BMI 	27.40 +- 2.97	27.03 +- 3.05	1.12	315	.263	 	Medication Number	5.33 +- 1.47	5.35 +- 1.49	-0.11	315	.910	 	Special Medication	1.29 +- 0.10	1.27 +- 0.87	0.12	315	.905	 	TUGT 	25.78 +- 5.34	25.40 +- 5.71	0.68	315	.495	 	BBS	30.97 +- 8.12	30.54 +- 7.22	0.48	315	.629	 	FES	53.13 +- 15.45	52.91 +- 16.45	0.22	315	.823	 	ABCS	76.12 +- 22.20	77.28 +- 21.03	0.07	315	.946	 	Falls Frequency	1.56 +- 0.66	1.58 +- 0.63	-0.29	315	.775	 	\nAbbreviations: ABCS, Activity-specific Balance Confidence Scale; BMI, Body Mass Index; FES, Falls Efficacy Scale; TUGT, Timed Up and Go Test.\nAs presented in Table 1, all variables had significance values more than 0.05, indicating that there was no difference between subjects in the control and experimental groups and they were well matched.\nIn order to compare homogeneity of groups, the chi-square test for differences between groups regarding demographic parameters including age, sex, activity of daily living (ADL), gender, balance, marital status, cognitive status, living area and living arrangement was conducted. In addition, in this study, cognitive status was measured by the Abbreviated Mental Test Score (AMTS). This test is routinely applied for elderly people. In this study neither of the subjects had severe cognitive impairment. This is because of the exclusion criteria, which excluded subjects with severe dementia and very low cognitive status. The P values of characteristics among subjects of this study were all greater than 0.05, indicating that subjects in the control and experimental groups were well matched.\nThe TUGT and BBS are two tests, which show subjects' functional capacity. The findings of this study regarding TUGT indicated that more than 85% of the subjects in both groups were suffering from moderate to severe gate disturbances. In addition, the P value for TUGT was 0.39, which rejects differences between baseline results of TUGT in control and experimental groups. In addition, the results of the study regarding BBS indicated that 70 to 75 percent of the subjects were at intermediate to high risk of falls due to balance impairment. The P value result for BBS was 0.16, which rejects there being differences between pre-intervention results of BBS in the control and experimental groups. All outcome variables were not significantly different between subjects in the control and experimental group, indicating that these groups were well matched.\nTo ensure fulfilment of the research objectives regarding the effects of exercise training on physical performance, the chi-square test was applied. Physical performance is evaluated by measurement of ACT and CST. The results of ACT are shown in Table 2. The comparison of post-intervention results of ACT, using the chi-square test, showed that there is a significant difference between post intervention results in the control and experimental groups (P &lt;= 0.00). In addition, the results of CST are shown in Table 2. The results, using the chi-square test showed that there was a significant different between control and experimental groups when comparing the post-intervention results of ACT (P &lt; 0.00) and CST (P &lt;= 0.001).\n Comparison of Outcome Variables Between Post-intervention Results in the Control and Experimental Groupsa\nOutcome Variables	Groups	X2	df	P Value	 		Control	Experimental				 	ACT			22.32	1	.00	 	Below	79 (49.68)	41 (25.6)				 	Average	77 (49.05)	109 (68.1)				 	Above	1 (00.27)	10 (06.3)				 	CST			55.65	2	.001	 	Weak	57 (31.90)	23 (14.4)				 	Strong	78 (68.10)	81 (50.6)				 	Strong and Endurance	22 (14)	56 (35)				 	TUGT			36.99	2	.017	 	Mild Impairment	21 (13.38)	71(44.38)				 	Moderate	98 (62.42)	65 (40.62)				 	Severe	38 (24.20)	24 (15)				 	BBS			21.31	2	.025	 	Low risk	33 (16.60)	45 (28.1)				 	Medium Risk	88 (68.80)	107 (66.9)				 	High Risk	36 (14.60)	8 (5)				 	Frequency of Falls			21. 19	3	.00	 	None	3 (1.90)	22 (11.87)				 	One	56 (35.70)	76 (44.37)				 	Two	92 (58.60)	60 (42.50)				 	Three	6 (3.80)	2 (1.25)				 	\nAbbreviations: ACT, Arm Curl Test; CST, Chair Stand Test; TUGT, Timed Up and Go Test; BBS, Berg Balance Scale.\naData are presented as No. (%).\nTo assess improvement of functional capacity, the results of TUGT and BBS were compared for subjects' post intervention results in the control and experimental groups. The TUGT results, as shown in Table 2, present significant differences between control and experimental groups when comparing the post-intervention results of TUGT (x2 = 36.99, df = 2, P-value = 0.017). In addition, BBS results, as are shown in Table 2, present significant differences between control and experimental groups when comparing the post-intervention results (x2 = 21.31, df = 2, P-value = 0.025).\nFigure 2 shows the change in means of measures for incidence of fall before and after intervention in both control and experimental groups.\nTrend of Falls Incidence Before and After Intervention in Control and Experimental Groups\nAccording to the results for comparing the mean in the control group the mean of fall incidence raised from 1.58 to 1.64 from pre to post intervention assessment. On the other hand, in the experimental group the means of fall incidence declined from 1.58 to 1.26 from pre to post intervention assessment. As it is indicated from the above-mentioned results, OEP can improve outcome variables such as TUGT, FES, BBS and ABCS. In addition, the OEP reduced the frequency of falls among subjects of the study.\n5. Discussion\nThe purpose of this study was to examine the effects of OEP to decline the incidence of falls among elderly community dwellers. The main advantage of this study was that the investigation was conducted on a normal community population covering all elderly people from both sexes and both rural and urban communities. The study followed standardized procedures for recruitment of participants, sampling, data collection and baseline assessment for clinical tests and follow-up of the outcomes, using trained research staff. The other advantage of this study was that the study was conducted in a developing country. There are scarce data regarding elderly people in developing countries. Moreover, the key subject of this study was falls. Based on the current knowledge, this is the first RCT on falls prevention in Iran.\nSubjects of the study were recruited from a population of elderly people with experience of at least one episode of fall. Previous falls is a risk factor and predisposing variable for falls among elderly community dwellers. The OEP as a home-based exercise designed to be applied for elderly people, can be used for those senior citizens who cannot benefit from luxurious institutional rehabilitation instruments. The OEP is a combination of muscle strengthening, balance training, and walking programs for the reduction of falls among senior citizens.\nThe results of this study add to the evidence on the effectiveness of the OEP for senior citizens in Iran. In other words, the results of this study support the hypothesis that a six-month home-based exercise training program, with supervision of a trained family member as a caregiver, can improve physical functioning and functional balance among elderly community-dwellers with a previous history of falls. The findings of this study are in accordance with the results of the systemic review and meta-analysis of Thomas et al. This study was six months in duration; however, the results are consistent with the study of Campbell et al., which showed that the benefits of OEP can last at least for two years.\nIn this study, the OEP was conducted by trained nurses and health officers. Robertson et al. (2001) recommended that OEP should be delivered by nurses. It can be as effective as when conducted by physiotherapists yet more cost-effective when nurses deliver the program to the community. Moreover, this study did not report any major and/or sever complaint due to exercise. The findings of this study were similar to a research conducted by Matsuda et al. which showed that home-based exercise training was completely safe.\nBalance as an important outcome of the study improved in subjects of the experimental group. It is likely that impaired balance is a stronger risk factor for falls (Sherrington et al. 2011). This was confirmed by Steadman et al. (2003), indicating that exercise improves balance and mobility and prevents falls among senior citizens. This study showed that OEP as a home-based exercise can improve functional capacity (BBS and TUGT), as a good predictor for balance. In addition, this study confirmed that OEP can increase subjects' physical performance, which is measured by ACT and CST. Rikli and Jones (1999) stated that CST is a valid instrument for predicting falls among elderly community dwellers, and concluded that strength in lower extremities (measured by CST) is more important than upper extremities in prevention of falls in elderly people. This study measured both upper and lower extremities before and after OEP and the results suggested that OEP can improve physical performance in elderly people.\nThere were some limitations that may affect the outcome of this study. The primary limitation of the study was the application of falls self-report profiles. In the data collection, self-reported data are condemned to be reluctant regarding their validity. In some cases, in order to validate falls, the researcher asked the clients' caregivers to approve occurrence of falls. In addition, the health condition of the majority of the subjects played a deterrent role for participation in the program.\nThis study supports the effectiveness of OEP to improve balance and prevent falls among elderly people. The findings of this study can be more applicable for homebound senior citizens and especially feasible as an alternative for costly high-tech exercises.\nAuthors Contribution:Ali Dadgari and Tengku Aizan Hamid were responsible for all related activities of the study, writing of the manuscript and supervision.

falls prevention interventions, translation into falls reductions has not yet been fully realised.\n\n While the hip fracture rate is decreasing, the number and rate of fall-related hospital admissions among older people is increasing.\n\n The challenge now is to deliver the most effective interventions efficiently at a population level, and for these interventions to be taken up by older people.\n\n\nObjective\nTo support the development, and evaluation of, effective falls prevention policy and practice in the state of Victoria, Australia.\n\n\nMethods\nThe RE-AIM model (Reach, Efficacy, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance) was used to identify strategies for an effective programme.\n\n Research objectives were developed to support the strategies.\n\n These include: (1) identification of subgroups of older people most frequently admitted to hospital for falls; (2) examining the acceptability of established falls interventions; (3) identification of factors that encourage and support relevant lifestyle changes; (4) identifying opportunities to incorporate confirmed interventions in existing programmes and services; (5) developing guidelines for sustainability.\n\n The research results will subsequently guide strategy details for the falls prevention plan.\n\n RE-AIM will provide the framework for the evaluation structure.\n\n\nOutcome measures\nMeasures to monitor the implementation of the selected interventions will be determined for each intervention, based on the five key factors of the RE-AIM model.\n\n The overall effect of

exercise and osteoporosis education program for older adults at risk of falls and fractures","abstract":"Background\nOsteoporosis affects over 220 million people worldwide, and currently there is no cure for the disease.\n\n Thus, there is a need to develop evidence-based, safe and acceptable prevention strategies at the population level that target multiple risk factors for fragility fractures to reduce the health and economic burden of the condition.\n\n\nMethods/design\nThe Osteo-cise: Strong Bones for Life study will investigate the effectiveness and feasibility of a multi-component targeted exercise, osteoporosis education/awareness and behavioural change program for improving bone health and muscle function and reducing falls risk in community-dwelling older adults at an increased risk of fracture.\n\n Men and women aged ?60?years will participate in an 18-month randomised controlled trial comprising a 12-month structured and supervised community-based program and a 6-month research to practise translational phase.\n\n Participants will be randomly assigned to either the Osteo-cise intervention or a self-management control group.\n\n The intervention will comprise a multi-modal exercise program incorporating high velocity progressive resistance training, moderate impact weight-bearing exercise and high challenging balance exercises performed three times weekly at local community-based fitness centres.\n\n A behavioural change program will be used to enhance exercise adoption and adherence to the program.\n\n Community-based osteoporosis education seminars will be conducted to improve participant knowledge and understanding of the risk factors and preventative measures for osteoporosis, falls and fractures.\n\n The primary outcomes measures, to be collected at baseline, 6, 12, and 18?months, will include DXA-derived hip and spine bone mineral density measurements and functional muscle power (timed stair-climb test).\n\n Secondary outcomes measures include: MRI-assessed distal femur and proximal tibia trabecular bone micro-architecture, lower limb and back maximal muscle strength, balance and function (four square step test, functional reach test, timed up-and-go test and 30-second sit-to-stand), falls incidence and health-related quality of life.\n\n Cost-effectiveness will also be assessed.\n\n\nDiscussion\nThe findings from the Osteo-cise: Strong Bones for Life study will provide new information on the efficacy of a targeted multi-modal community-based exercise program incorporating high velocity resistance training, together with an osteoporosis education and behavioural change program for improving multiple risk factors for falls and fracture in older adults at risk of fragility fracture.\n\n\nTrial registration\nAustralian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry reference

and turning have also been associated with an increased risk of hip fracture in older people.\n\n Despite the importance of stability during turning, there has been little focus on identifying this impairment in at risk older people, or in evaluating interventions aiming to improve this outcome.\n\n This study will evaluate the effectiveness of a 16 week tailored home based exercise program in older adults aged (50 years and above) who were identified as having unsteadiness during turning.\n\n\nMethods/Design\nA single blind randomized controlled trial will be conducted, with assessors blind to group allocation.\n\n Study participants will be aged 50 years and above, living in the community and have been identified as having impaired turning ability [outside of age and gender normal limits on the Step Quick Turn (180 degree turn) task on the Neurocom Balance Master with long plate].\n\n After a comprehensive baseline assessment, those classified as having balance impairment while turning will be randomized to intervention or control group.\n\n The intervention group will receive a 16 week individualized balance and strength home exercise program, based on the Otago Exercise Program with additional exercises focused on improving turning ability.\n\n Intervention group will attend four visit to the assessment centre over 16 weeks period, for provision, monitoring, modification of the exercise and encourage ongoing participation.\n\n Participants in the control group will continue with their usual activities.\n\n All participants will be re-assessed on

community-based randomised controlled trial of a multi-modal exercise and osteoporosis education program for older adults at risk of falls and fractures","abstract":"Background\nOsteoporosis affects over 220 million people worldwide, and currently there is no cure for the disease.\n\n Thus, there is a need to develop evidence-based, safe and acceptable prevention strategies at the population level that target multiple risk factors for fragility fractures to reduce the health and economic burden of the condition.\n\n\nMethods/design\nThe Osteo-cise: Strong Bones for Life study will investigate the effectiveness and feasibility of a multi-component targeted exercise, osteoporosis education/awareness and behavioural change program for improving bone health and muscle function and reducing falls risk in community-dwelling older adults at an increased risk of fracture.\n\n Men and women aged ?60?years will participate in an 18-month randomised controlled trial comprising a 12-month structured and supervised community-based program and a 6-month research to practise translational phase.\n\n Participants will be randomly assigned to either the Osteo-cise intervention or a self-management control group.\n\n The intervention will comprise a multi-modal exercise program incorporating high velocity progressive resistance training, moderate impact weight-bearing exercise and high challenging balance exercises performed three times weekly at local community-based fitness centres.\n\n A behavioural change program will be used to enhance exercise adoption and adherence to the program.\n\n Community-based osteoporosis education seminars will be conducted to improve participant knowledge and understanding of the risk factors and preventative measures for osteoporosis, falls and fractures.\n\n The primary outcomes measures, to be collected at baseline, 6, 12, and 18?months, will include DXA-derived hip and spine bone mineral density measurements and functional muscle power (timed stair-climb test).\n\n Secondary outcomes measures include: MRI-assessed distal femur and proximal tibia trabecular bone micro-architecture, lower limb and back maximal muscle strength, balance and function (four square step test, functional reach test, timed up-and-go test and 30-second sit-to-stand), falls incidence and health-related quality of life.\n\n Cost-effectiveness will also be assessed.\n\n\nDiscussion\nThe findings from the Osteo-cise: Strong Bones for Life study will provide new information on the efficacy of a targeted multi-modal community-based exercise program incorporating high velocity resistance training, together with an osteoporosis education and behavioural change program for improving multiple risk factors for falls and fracture in older adults at risk of fragility fracture.\n\n\nTrial registration\nAustralian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry reference

moderate severity Alzheimer's disease: protocol for a randomised trial","abstract":"Background\nBalance dysfunction and falls are common problems in later stages of dementia.\n\n Exercise is a well-established intervention to reduce falls in cognitively intact older people, although there is limited randomised trial evidence of outcomes in people with dementia.\n\n The primary objective of this study is to evaluate whether a home-based balance exercise programme improves balance performance in people with mild to moderate severity Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\nMethods/design\nTwo hundred and fourteen community dwelling participants with mild to moderate severity Alzheimer's disease will be recruited for the randomised controlled trial.\n\n A series of laboratory and clinical measures will be used to evaluate balance and mobility performance at baseline.\n\n Participants will then be randomized to receive either a balance training home exercise programme (intervention group) from a physiotherapist, or an education, information and support programme from an occupational therapist (control group).\n\n Both groups will have six home visits in the six months following baseline assessment, as well as phone support.\n\n All participants will be re-assessed at the completion of the programme (after six months), and again in a further six months to evaluate sustainability of outcomes.\n\n The primary outcome measures will be the Limits of Stability (a force platform measure of balance) and the Step Test (a clinical measure of balance).\n\n Secondary outcomes include other balance and mobility measures, number of falls and falls risk measures, cognitive and behavioural measures, and carer burden and quality of life measures.\n\n Assessors will be blind to group allocation.\n\n\nDiscussion\nBy introducing a balance programme at an early stage of the dementia pathway, when participants are more likely capable of safe and active participation in balance training, there is potential that balance performance will be improved as dementia progresses, which may reduce the high falls risk at this later stage.\n\n If successful, this approach has the potential for widespread application through community based services for people with mild to moderate severity Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\nTrial registration\nThe protocol for this study is registered

effectiveness of interventions designed to increase activity levels.\n\n This study systematically reviewed the literature to determine the extent of agreement between subjectively (self-report e.\n\ng.\n\n questionnaire, diary) and objectively (directly measured; e.\n\ng.\n\n accelerometry, doubly labeled water) assessed physical activity in adults.\n\n\nMethods\nEight electronic databases were searched to identify observational and experimental studies of adult populations.\n\n Searching identified 4,463 potential articles.\n\n Initial screening found that 293 examined the relationship between self-reported and directly measured physical activity and met the eligibility criteria.\n\n Data abstraction was completed for 187 articles, which described comparable data and/or comparisons, while 76 articles lacked comparable data or comparisons, and a further 30 did not meet the review's eligibility requirements.\n\n A risk of bias assessment was conducted for all articles from which data was abstracted.\n\n\nResults\nCorrelations between self-report and direct measures were generally low-to-moderate and ranged from -0.71 to 0.96. No clear pattern emerged for the mean differences between self-report and direct measures of physical activity.\n\n Trends differed by measure of physical activity employed, level of physical activity measured, and the gender of participants.\n\n Results of the risk of bias assessment indicated that 38% of the studies had lower quality scores.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe findings suggest that the measurement method may have a significant impact on the observed levels of physical activity.\n\n Self-report measures of physical activity were both higher and lower than directly measured levels of physical activity, which poses a problem for both reliance on self-report measures and for attempts to correct for self-report  direct measure differences.\n\n This review reveals the need for valid, accurate and reliable measures of physical activity in evaluating current and changing physical activity levels, physical activity interventions, and the relationships between physical activity and health outcomes.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2588639","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Stphanie A","surname":"Prince","email":"sprin063@uottawa.ca","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kristi B","surname":"Adamo","email":"kadamo@cheo.on.ca","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Meghan E","surname":"Hamel","email":"meghanhamel@gmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jill","surname":"Hardt","email":"jillhardt@gmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sarah Connor","surname":"Gorber","email":"Sarah.ConnorGorber@statcan.ca","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mark","surname":"Tremblay","email":"mtremblay@cheo.on.ca","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1177/0269215506069475","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A systematic review of the human activity profile","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1111/j.1532-5415.2005.53455.x","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Development of a common outcome data set for fall injury prevention trials: the prevention of falls network Europe consensus","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Effects of preventive home visits to elderly people living in the community: systematic review.","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMcp020719","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical practice.

process by emphasizing the necessity of its differentiation, and consequently individualization, developing, and improving the technique in women and men.\n Indicating differences can also help in determining the risk of injury in order to prevent from them by diversifying training programs.\n However, there is no information regarding this problem in the existing literature pertaining to table tennis.\n Therefore, the aim of the study was to evaluate the differences in the values of selected angular and kinematic parameters during topspin forehand and topspin backhand shots between male and female table tennis players.\n Methods: Six male and six female advanced table tennis players performed topspin forehand and topspin backhand shots, both receiving a backspin ball.\n The angular parameters in four events (ready position, backswing, maximum acceleration, and forward) at chosen joints as well as the maximal acceleration of the playing hand were measured, using the myoMotion system, and were compared between male and female players.\n Results: Significant differences (p ? 0.05) were found in the magnitude of angular parameters and maximum hand acceleration between men and women.\n The movement pattern of topspin strokes performed by men takes into account, more than that in the case of women, movements that use large muscle groups and large joints (hip joints, trunk joints, shoulder joints in extension, and flexion).\n The difference in the values of maximal acceleration reached almost 50 m/s2 in topspin forehand (p &lt; 0.01) and 20 m/s2 in backhand (p &lt; 0.01).\n Conclusions: Differentiation of movement patterns can be a manifestation of movement optimization due to anthropological differences and limitations.\n The differences in the values of maximal acceleration suggest that women could use both sides to perform a topspin attack against the backspin ball, while men should seek opportunities to make a stronger shot with a forehand topspin.\n","id":"PMC7459798","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"Ziemowit","surname":"Ba?kosz","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"S?awomir","surname":"Winiarski","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ivan","surname":"Malagoli

intent to move rapidly, without special equipment or venue, induces an improvement of explosive plantar flexion force, which is attributable to neuromuscular rather than musculotendinous adaptations. Although the training effect on balance performance was trivial, we found a sign of improvement (i.e., neuromuscular adaptations during standing). In conclusion, functional neuromuscular capacity can be enhanced by home-based calf-raise exercise in elderly men, which may protect against mobility loss with aging.\nThis study examined whether home-based, high-speed calf-raise training changes the rate of torque development (RTD) during plantar flexion contractions and balance performance in elderly men. Thirty-four healthy elderly men (73 +- 5 yr) were randomly assigned to a training or control group (n = 17 in each group). The subjects in the training group completed 8 wk (3 times/wk) of home-based bilateral calf-raise training using body mass. Before and after the intervention, RTD during plantar flexion contractions and center-of-pressure (COP) displacement during single-leg standing were measured. Surface electromyographic amplitude of the triceps surae and tibialis anterior during the strength and single-leg standing was measured. Clinical magnitude-based inferences were used to interpret the training effect, with the smallest worthwhile effect assumed to be 0.2 of the baseline SD. The peak RTD increased 21% (90% confidence limits, +-19%) relative to the control group, which was accompanied by corresponding changes of the medial gastrocnemius (MG) and soleus (SOL) activations. The effect on COP displacement was possibly trivial (0%, +-13%), whereas substantial reduction in the MG (-19%, +-15%) and SOL (-25%, +-13%) activations during standing was observed. Our findings indicate that calf-raise training at home, performed without special equipment or venue, induces a substantial increase in the plantar flexors' rapid force-generating capability and triceps surae activations. Although the training effect on standing balance performance was not substantial, observed changes in the triceps surae activations during standing are expected to contribute to future balance performance improvement.\nNEW &amp; NOTEWORTHY Calf-raise training with the intent to move rapidly, without special equipment or venue, induces an improvement of explosive plantar flexion force, which is attributable to neuromuscular rather than musculotendinous adaptations. Although the training effect on balance performance was trivial, we found a sign of improvement (i.e., neuromuscular adaptations during standing). In conclusion, functional neuromuscular capacity can be enhanced by home-based calf-raise exercise in elderly men, which may protect against mobility loss with aging.\nage-related decline of explosive strength of the skeletal muscles can be a significant limiting factor in daily activities. Explosive strength is often evaluated as the rate of force development (RFD), which is defined as the slope of the time force/torque curve during the initial phase of isometric contraction from a low or resting level. Izquierdo et al. observed that the RFD during isometric squat was lower in elderly than in young people and that a lower RFD was related to impaired balance performance. In addition, it was suggested that an age-related decrement of plantar flexion RFD leads to a high risk of falling. These findings indicate the importance of preventing the reduction in RFD for elderly people so as to maintain their functional capacity in daily life. In particular, it is possible that an increase in the plantar flexion RFD would result in improved balance performance and thus help to reduce the risk of falling.\nResistance exercise involving explosive muscle contraction (i.e., as fast and forcefully as possible) is effective for enhancement of RFD in elderly as well as young people. The exercise load in those previous studies was relatively high [8-12 repetition maximum load, 75-80% of 1 repetition maximum load, and &gt;=80% or &gt;90% of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) force or torque]. In contrast, at least for plantar flexion, training with low exercise load (30-40% of 1 repetition maximum load) at high speed induced an increase in RFD in young individuals. In addition, power training at low load improved balance performance in elderly people. With the consideration that the muscularity of the plantar flexors in elderly people is reduced compared with young people and that relatively low external load moved at a high speed can involve high forces of agonist muscles, we expected that training with low exercise load, such as calf-raise exercises using body mass at high speed (i.e., with the intent to move rapidly), would induce an increase in their plantar flexion RFD and balance performance. Clarification of the training response induced by body mass-based exercise would provide beneficial information regarding effective training programs for elderly people, because such exercises can be performed regardless of location and without special equipment and might reduce injury risks while facilitating continuation of the exercise. The purpose of the current study was to examine the effect of home-based, high-speed calf-raise training for the plantar flexors on rapid force production and balance performance in elderly men.\nMETHODS\nSubjects\nThirty-four healthy elderly men (73 +- 5 yr, 165 +- 7 cm, 64 +- 9 kg, means +- SD) volunteered to join the study. The study participants were assigned to a training or control group (n = 17 in each group) by stratified randomization in advance so as to match the age, height, and body mass between the two groups. The mean height in the training group was less than that in the control group by 2.5 cm (a small difference), but differences in age (1 yr) and body mass (0.6 kg) were trivial. All of the participants were functionally independent in daily life, whereas some of them participated in walking [n = 10 (training group) and n = 11 (control group)], ground golf [n = 9 (training group) and n = 8 (control group)], table tennis [n = 3 (training group) and n = 0 (control group)], softball [n = 2 (training group) and n = 2 (control group)], and/or tennis [n = 0 (training group) and n = 2 (control group)], once or twice per week, and others were sedentary [n = 2 (training group), n = 2 (control group)]. None of the participants performed resistance exercises. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Shibaura Institute of Technology. The subjects were informed of the purpose and potential risks of the study and provided written informed consent before participation.\nExperimental Design\nThe subjects in the training group performed 8 wk of home-based bilateral calf-raise training and maintained their usual diet. The time of day for exercising was not controlled to maximize compliance with the exercises and to diminish the possibility of dropout from the study. The subjects in the control group were requested to continue their normal daily activities and eating habits throughout the same period. Before and after the intervention (2-3 days after the last training session in the training group), maximum and explosive plantar flexion strength; balance performance; muscle activation of the medial gastrocnemius (MG), lateral gastrocnemius (LG), soleus (SOL), and tibialis anterior (TA) during strength and balance measurements; muscle thickness of the triceps surae; and muscle architecture (muscle thickness, pennation angle, and fascicle length) of MG were determined. The test measurements were performed on the pivot leg, defined as the opposite leg to that used for kicking a ball.\nTraining Protocol\nThe subjects in the training group conducted bilateral calf-raise exercises at home, three times per week for 8 wk, with 1 or 2 days between the training sessions. One session of the training comprised 3 sets of 10 repetitions with a 2-min rest between sets. From a standing position with both feet on flat ground, the subjects raised their heels (concentric phase) as fast as possible and dropped them at a moderate speed (~2 s), with the knees straight. One cycle of this action was performed every 5 s. The touching of a wall or chair was allowed during the training sessions so as to prevent falls during exercise. The first training session was performed in the laboratory with the aid of explanation and feedback by an examiner. Midway through the intervention (i.e., after 4 wk from the beginning of the training program), the subjects visited our laboratory again to be checked as to whether the training protocol was being performed correctly. During the intervention period, each subject was asked to note on a form the following instructions: 1) please check the box of the day when you conducted the calf-raise exercises, 2) in each set, if you completed 10 repetitions, please check the box on a form; otherwise, please enter the number of repetitions that you did. The subjects submitted the forms twice (i.e., midway through the intervention and after the intervention). In addition, an examiner sometimes called to verify the forms. As a result, all subjects in the training group completed the program correctly (i.e., 3 times per week, 3 sets of 10 repetitions) without any injuries or diseases.\nStrength Testing\nIsometric plantar flexion MVC was measured with a specially customized dynamometer equipped with a torque transducer (TD200; Kubota, Osaka, Japan) (Fig. 1). The subject sat on the bench of the dynamometer (hip joint angle = 80 , knee joint angle = 0 , and ankle joint angle = 0 ; anatomical position = 0 ), while securing the knee and foot on the bench and footplate with nonelastic straps to prevent knee flexion and heel raise during contractions. Care was taken to adjust the centers of rotation of the dynamometer and ankle joint. We carefully matched the subject's relative position on the dynamometer between the measurements before and after the intervention. After several submaximal plantar flexion contractions with the intent to perform rapidly as a warm-up, the subject was encouraged to perform plantar flexion as fast and forcefully as possible and to maintain plantar flexion for 3 s. The contractions were conducted three times with 1-min rests, and verbal encouragement was provided during all contractions. The torque signals were acquired at 1,000 Hz with an analog-to-digital converter (PowerLab16/35; ADInstruments, New South Wales, Australia) and transferred to a computer. In addition, to normalize the electromyographic (EMG) values of TA to those from the MVC trial, isometric dorsiflexion with maximal effort was also performed. With the use of a fourth-order zero-phase lag Butterworth filter, the torque signal was low-pass filtered at 15 Hz. The peak value of each torque signal was defined as MVC torque. The rate of torque development (RTD) was defined as the slope of the filtered time-torque curve over time intervals of 0-10 to 0-250 ms from the onset of plantar flexion, respectively (Figs. 2 and 3). The peak value of the first derivative of the time-torque curve (RTDpeak) was also determined using derivative function (time period: 0.001 s). The onset of plantar flexion was defined as the instant when plantar flexion torque exceeded the baseline by 2.5% of MVC torque. We assessed RTD at several time intervals, because different physiological factors are reported to be related to early and later phases of RTD and because a previous longitudinal study observed phase-specific changes in RTD after resistance training. In addition, RTD normalized to MVC torque (normalized RTD) was calculated. The trial in which the highest RTDpeak or MVC torque was observed was used for the later analyses of RTD and MVC torque, respectively. The means of the coefficient of variation (CV) and intraclass correlation coefficients type 1.1 [ICC (1,1)] of the highest and second-highest values were 10.1% and 0.930 for RTDpeak and 3.2% and 0.977 for MVC torque, respectively. Day-to-day repeatability of the measurements (for elderly men, n = 10, 74 +- 6 yr) was also evaluated. The means of CVs and ICCs (1,1) were 10.6% and 0.914 for RTDpeak and 6.1% and 0.938 for MVC torque, respectively.\nExperimental setup for strength testing.\nExamples of torque (A) and smoothed electromyography (EMG) signals (B; a 50-ms moving root mean square window) of the medial gastrocnemius during maximal voluntary isometric plantar flexion. Time = 0 corresponds to the onset of plantar flexion. Onsets of the plantar flexion/EMG signal are denoted by black circle/triangle, and time intervals of 100 ms relative to onsets are indicated by white circle/triangle. Rate of torque development (RTD) was defined as the slope of the time-torque curve over time intervals of 0-10 to 0-250 ms from the onset of plantar flexion. The peak value of the first derivative of the time-torque curve was defined as RTDpeak. Rate of EMG rise (RER) was defined as the slope of the time-smoothed EMG curve over time intervals of 0-10 to 0-250 ms from the onset of EMG signals. Determinations of RTD and RER over the time interval of 0-100 are indicated as examples. The difference between the onset of plantar flexion and EMG signals was defined as electromechanical delay of the medial gastrocnemius (EMDMG).\nExamples of time-torque curve of a subject in the training (A) and control (B) groups before (dotted lines) and after (solid lines) the 8-wk training period. Onset of plantar flexion is denoted by black circles. Vertical lines and white circles indicate time intervals of 100 ms relative to the onset of plantar flexion as an example of 1 time point.\nBalance Performance Measurement\nStatic balance performance with single-leg standing was evaluated similarly to a previous study. The subjects stood barefoot with one leg (pivot leg) on the platform of a center-of-pressure (COP) tracking instrument (T.K.K.5810; Takei Scientific Instruments, Niigata, Japan) for 30 s with their eyes open. During the standing, the participants fixed their gaze on a visual target mounted on a wall, 2 m in front of them, located at eye height above the floor. They were asked to hold their arms at their sides and to lift the opposite foot (kicking foot) with the knee flexed at ~90 . Three trials were performed with sufficient rests between the trials. If the subjects could not keep the raised foot up or the supporting leg left on the platform, then the trial was ended. The COP signals were sampled at 20 Hz and stored on a personal computer without being lowpass filtered. Before the subject stood on the platform, we confirmed no COP displacement on the raw data (i.e., high-frequency noise contamination seems unlikely). The data of the first 5 s from the beginning of the onset were eliminated to prevent the effect of postural changes on the COP trajectory. Thereafter, the COP displacement was determined for the time period corresponding to 5-30 s, and the total COP displacement divided by the above time period (i.e., 25 s) was defined as COP speed. The minimum of COP speed among the trials in which the subject could remain standing for 30 s was used for further analysis. When the subject could never stand for 30 s, the trial in which the subject could stand longest was selected for the analyses, and the path length was determined from 5 s after onset until 3 s before the end of the trial. Regarding the day-to-day repeatability, the means of CV and ICC (1,1) of the COP speed on two different days (for elderly men, n = 10) were 5.4% and 0.907, respectively.\nEMG Measurement\nSurface EMG signals were acquired from MG, LG, SOL, and TA of the pivot leg during the plantar flexion strength and balance performance measurements. The muscle belly and fascicle longitudinal directions were confirmed using real-time B-mode ultrasonography (ACUSON S2000; Siemens Medical Solutions, Malvern, PA), with a probe perpendicular to the skin for identifying the fascicles. After skin shaving, rubbing with sandpaper, and cleaning with alcohol, bipolar Ag/AgCl surface electrodes (F-150M; size adjustment by cutting to 10 x 20 mm, 20 mm interelectrode distance) with high-pass filtering at 5 Hz, using a bioamplifier system (MEG-6108; Nihon Kohden, Tokyo, Japan), were placed at 40% (MG and TA) and 30% (LG) of the lower-leg length, determined as the length from the popliteal crease to the lateral malleolus. For SOL, electrode placement was ~5 cm distal from the level of 40% of the lower-leg length, but there were interindividual variations due to the variability of the superficial region of SOL. To match the electrode placement between before and after the intervention, the subjects were requested to keep some marks on their skin by tracing after taking a bath every day; these were recorded in the test before the intervention, and photographs of the electrode placement were taken during the test. The EMG signals were recorded at a sampling frequency of 1,000 Hz and stored in a personal computer after analog-to-digital conversion (PowerLab16/35; ADInstruments). Regarding the analyses of EMG signal data on strength measurements, EMG signals were smoothed with a 50-ms moving root mean square (RMS) window. The rate of EMG rise (RER) of the triceps surae muscles during MVC trials was determined as the slope of the smoothed time-EMG curve from EMG onset to 10-250 ms (Fig. 2). The threshold of EMG onset was set at means + 3 SDs from the baseline (means and SD were calculated at rest over a 200-ms time window). In addition, the electromechanical delay of MG (EMDMG) was determined as the difference in time between onsets of plantar flexion torque and EMG amplitude of MG (Fig. 2). The EMDMG at the anatomical position (i.e., joint angle in the current strength measurement) is less affected by slack in the Achilles tendon, and the value is associated with the Achilles tendon stiffness, which is one of the predictors of the plantar flexion RFD. Although these analyses were performed automatically using MATLAB software (MathWorks, Natick, MA), onsets of EMG signals were visually confirmed because the automatic detection is not always accurate. In addition, the RMS values of EMG signals (RMS-EMGs) during MVC trials were calculated over a 0.5-s period around the maximal torque. With respect to the EMG signals during balance performance measurements, RMS-EMG during single-leg standing was calculated from high-pass-filtered EMG signals for the period corresponding to the COP displacement determination and normalized to those recorded during MVC trials.\nUltrasonographic Measurement\nThe muscle thickness of the triceps surae and pennation angle of MG were measured using B-mode ultrasonography (for muscle thickness of the triceps surae, SSA-770 Aplio 80; Toshiba Medical Systems, Tochigi, Japan; for MG architecture, ACUSON S2000, Siemens Medical Solutions) with a 60-mm width linear-array probe. The muscle thickness of the triceps surae was determined during quiet standing at 30% of the lower-leg length from the popliteal crease to the lateral malleolus. The muscle thickness and pennation angle of MG were measured in a sitting position on the seat of the dynamometer with the muscles relaxed at the same joint angles used for strength testing. With respect to MG measurements, special care was taken to match the measurement regions and fascicles before and after the intervention as follows. First, the measurement region was assigned along the lower-leg length. Second, the mediolateral width of MG was determined over the skin by identifying the boundaries between MG and LG and between MG and the tibia. Lastly, the measurement regions were determined as 40% of the lower length from the popliteal crease to lateral malleolus and 40% of the mediolateral width from the boundary between MG and tibia. The muscle thickness of MG was defined as the distance between superficial and deep aponeuroses at the center of each image, and the pennation angle was determined as the angle between the fascicle and deep aponeurosis. The fascicle length of MG was estimated from the muscle thickness and sine component of the pennation angle. These analyses were conducted using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). The measurement was conducted two times for muscle thickness of the triceps surae and three times for muscle architecture of MG, and mean values of the repeated measures were used for further analyses. The means of CVs and ICCs (1,2) or (1,3) of the repeated measurements were 0.6% and 0.996 for muscle thickness of the triceps surae, 3.8% and 0.982 for muscle thickness of MG, 2.8% and 0.973 for MG pennation angle, and 4.1% and 0.954 for MG fascicle length, respectively. The repeatability of ultrasound measurements on 2 different days was evaluated (for elderly men, n = 10). The means of CVs and ICCs (1,1) were 1.5% and 0.920 for muscle thickness of the triceps surae, 5.6% and 0.813 for muscle thickness of MG, 5.1% and 0.872 for pennation angle of MG, and 4.6% and 0.847 for fascicle length of MG, respectively.\nPhysical Activity during the Intervention Period\nGiven that it was difficult to match the exercise habits perfectly between the two groups, physical activity during the intervention period for 8 wk was monitored using a triaxial accelerometer (Actimarker EW4800; Panasonic Electric Works, Osaka, Japan). The accuracy of such measurement has been confirmed. The subject was asked to wear the device during daily life, except for time spent in the bath or sleeping. The mean magnitude of physical activity (minutes/day) was determined at three levels using the concept of metabolic equivalents (METs): low (1.5-2.9 METs), moderate (3.0-5.9 METs), and vigorous intensities (&gt;6.0 METs), respectively.\nStatistical Analysis\nAll data were log transformed before analyses. For ease of interpretation, the data are presented as means +- SD of raw data, unless noted otherwise. Because of disconnection of the EMG cable, EMG signals of LG could not be recorded from three subjects (2 in the training group and 1 in the control group) at measurement before the intervention. Clinical magnitude-based inferences were performed to assess the magnitude of training-induced changes in variables using a published spreadsheet. The approach determines the training effect as unclear if the confidence interval includes values that are substantial in some beneficial and harmful sense; otherwise, the effect is characterized with probabilistic terms. Regarding COP speed and RMS-EMG of TA during MVC, there were moderate group differences at baseline, and thus an adjustment for baseline was performed in the spreadsheet. We chose three values of the covariate for adjustment of the training effect: overall mean and highest and lowest values of the control group. Standardized difference in the mean change was calculated as the difference in mean change between the two groups divided by between-subject SD at baseline, and 0.2 of between-subject SD was assumed to be the smallest worthwhile effect. According to the suggestions of Hopkins et al., the level of confidence interval was set at 90%. The qualitative probabilistic terms were assigned as follows: 25-75%, possibly; 75-95%, likely; 95-99.5%, very-likely; &gt;99.5%, most likely. If chance of benefit and harm were &gt;50% and &gt;1.5%, respectively, then the training effect was interpreted as clinically unclear. The percent effect of the training was determined as the difference in the mean change between the two groups via back transformation. In addition, an SD of individual responses to training in percent units for main outcomes was calculated from a spreadsheet. The thresholds for interpretation of the standardized mean change/difference were 0.2, 0.6, and 1.2 for small, moderate, and large, and the value was halved for interpreting individual responses to training.\nRESULTS\nStrength\nThere were substantial increases in absolute RTD (percent effects, 34-106%) and normalized RTD (51-104%), except for at some phases (clinically unclear: absolute values at 190-230 ms and normalized values at 10-20 and 160-250 ms; possibly trivial: absolute values at 240 and 250 ms), with the observed effects as small to moderate (Fig. 4). With respect to RTDpeak and plantar flexion MVC torque (Table 1), there were likely (RTDpeak) and possibly (MVC torque) beneficial effects of training. The SDs of individual responses to training in percent units were moderate for RTDpeak (28% and 90% confidence limits, +-24%) and unclear for MVC torque (-6%; +-16%) because of large uncertainty. A likely substantial decrease (-14%; 90% confidence limits, +-14%) was observed in dorsiflexion torque (training group, from 21 +- 5 to 20 +- 7 Nm; control group, from 21 +- 7 to 22 +- 7 Nm).\nThe rate of torque development (RTD; A) and RTD relative to maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) torque of the plantar flexion (normalized RTD; B) in the training (left) and control (right) groups before and after the intervention. The RTD was defined as the slope of the filtered time-torque curve over time intervals of 0-10 to 0-250 ms from the onset of plantar flexion. Symbols denote clearly substantial effects:  , likely beneficial change. The changes in RTD at 240 and 250 ms were clear and at least possibly trivial.

Change and difference in the mean change were calculated via back transformation with a published spreadsheet, and the data of COP speed were determined after adjustment for baseline. The changes in muscle architecture were not substantial (i.e., absolute value of the standardized difference in the mean change was below 0.2) but clear and at least possibly trivial for muscle thickness of the triceps surae and pennation angle of the medial gastrocnemius and possibly harmful for muscle thickness and fascicle length of the medial gastrocnemius.

The SD of individual responses to the training in percent unit was estimated to be unclear because of large uncertainty (-12%; +-18% with the 3 adjustment values).\nEMG Variables\nRER.\nFigure 5 shows RERs of the agonist plantar flexor muscles. There were substantial increases in RERs of MG at 30-100, 180-200, and 220-250 ms (percent effects, 58-206%) and SOL at 10-160 and 230-250 ms (47-391%), whereas those at other regions were possibly trivial or clinically unclear. No substantial changes were shown in the effects of RERs of LG or TA during plantar flexion contractions at all phases.\nThe rate of electromyography rise (RER) of the medial gastrocnemius (A), lateral gastrocnemius (B), and soleus (C) in the training (left) and control (right) groups before and after the intervention. The RER was defined as the slope of the smoothed time-electromyogram curve over time intervals of 0-10 to 0-250 ms from the onset of electromyogram. Symbols denote clearly substantial effects: *, possibly beneficial change;  , likely beneficial change;  , very-likely beneficial change. The changes in RER of the lateral gastrocnemius were not substantial (i.e., absolute value of the standardized difference in the mean change was below 0.2) but clear and at least possibly trivial/harmful at 10-40, 80, 100-130, and 180-250 ms. Data are presented as means +- SD of raw data.\nEMDMG.\nThe EMDMG was 63 +- 21 ms (before) and 63 +- 16 ms (after) in the training group and 67 +- 21 ms (before) and 66 +- 25 ms (after) in the control group. The effect of the training was possibly trivial (6%; 90% confidence limits, +-28%).\nRMS-EMG during MVC trials.\nThere was a very-likely substantial effect on RMS-EMG of MG (36%; 90% confidence limits, +-28%), with the magnitude of effect being moderate. The values in the training group were 0.38 +- 0.20 mV (before) and 0.49 +- 0.21 mV (after) and were 0.36 +- 0.14 mV (before) and 0.35 +- 0.13 mV (after) in the control group. The likely beneficial effects were observed on RMS-EMGs of LG (20%; +-23%) and SOL (27%; +-20%). The effects on those of TA during dorsiflexion MVC (-18 through -1%) and during plantar flexion MVC as an antagonist (23-33%) were possibly harmful, with the threshold as trivial to small, except when that during dorsiflexion MVC was adjusted to lowest baseline value of the control group (25%; +-84% &quot;clinically unclear&quot;).\nRMS-EMG during single-leg standing.\nThe normalized RMS-EMGs of each muscle are shown in Fig. 6. The normalized RMS-EMGs of MG (-19%; 90% confidence limits, +-15%) and SOL (-25%; +-13%) substantially decreased (beneficial effect), as small to moderate effects, whereas that of TA (31%; +-40%) increased (harmful effect), with the threshold as small. In contrast, the effect on RMS-EMG of LG (-10%; +-25%) was possibly trivial.\nThe root mean square values of electromyogram (RMS-EMG) during single-leg standing relative to those recorded at maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) in the training (A) and control (B) groups before (open bars) and after (black bars) the intervention.

The change in lateral gastrocnemius (LG) was clear and at least possibly trivial. TA, tibialis anterior; MG, medial gastrocnemius; SOL, soleus. Data are presented as means +- SD of raw data.\nMuscle Architecture\nThe values of architectural parameters are shown in Table 1. No substantial effects were shown in the variables, whereas the trivial effects were clear: possibly trivial for muscle thickness of the triceps surae and pennation angle of MG and possibly harmful for muscle thickness and fascicle length of MG. The SDs of individual responses to training in percent units were estimated to be 5.2% (90% confidence limits, +-1.8%) for muscle thickness of the triceps surae; 1.9% (+-8.0%) for muscle thickness of MG; -7.4% (+-9.2%) for pennation angle of MG; and -5.3% (+-9.9%) for fascicle length of MG. The threshold of the SD was large for muscle thickness of the triceps surae, whereas unclear for other variables because of large uncertainties.\nPhysical Activity during the Intervention Period\nThe magnitudes of physical activity during the training or control period were as follows: at light intensity, 242.5 +- 70.8 min/day (training group) and 233.4 +- 52.2 min/day (control group); at moderate intensity, 44.3 +- 28.7 min/day (training group) and 37.7 +- 21.4 min/day (control group); at vigorous intensity, 0.9 +- 3.4 min/day (training group) and 0.3 +- 0.4 min/day (control group). There were not any clear group differences in the magnitude of physical activity. The differences were 3% (90% confidence limits, +-15%) at low intensity, -15% (+-50%) at moderate intensity, and 4% (+-40%) at vigorous intensity.\nDISCUSSION\nThe current study demonstrated that without special equipment or venue, high-speed calf-raise training for 8 wk induced an improvement in both absolute and normalized values of plantar flexion RTD in elderly men. Because the normalized RTD reflects the capability of a subject to develop force rapidly, regardless of his maximum force capacity, and because muscle activation (i.e., RER) of the triceps surae was also increased without substantial changes in the triceps surae musculature, the present results suggest that the rapid force-generating capability of the triceps surae was improved by the intervention. In contrast, the change in static balance performance with single-leg standing was trivial, according to clinical magnitude-based inferences. However, muscle activations of MG and SOL during single-leg standing were substantially reduced after the intervention, which may result in better balance performance. The findings indicate that the calf-raise training used here is effective for improving RTD of the plantar flexion and exhibits neuromuscular adaptations that can contribute to balance performance improvement.\nThe increases in RER of the muscles trained in the current study are in line with previous studies. Folland et al. showed that the variability of RFD at an early phase (&lt;=75 ms from the onset) was mainly explained by the variability of neural factors of agonist muscles, whereas the variability of MVC force was related to the RFD at a later phase. In addition, neural factors largely contributed to RFD relative to MVC force, irrespective of phase. The absolute and normalized RTDs were clearly increased, except for those at some later phases (Fig. 4). The improvement of RERs of MG and SOL was notable at the early phase (likely to very-likely beneficial change) and also occurred at the later phase (Fig. 5). Improved neural drive at the early phase has been reported after explosive strength training but not after sustained-contraction strength training. Thus exercises with the intent to move rapidly seem important for increasing agonist muscle activations, especially at the early phase. Regarding MVC torque, the effect was clinically clear, but the magnitude of training effect (7%, possible beneficial change) was smaller compared with that of RTDpeak (21%, likely beneficial change). This is consistent with a previous finding after explosive-type training (explosive strength improvement &gt; maximal strength improvement), suggesting that it may be difficult to obtain a similar training effect in maximal strength to that in explosive strength after explosive-type training. The increase in MVC torque was accompanied by substantial increases in RMS-EMGs of the triceps surae during MVC. Moreover, in the training group, relative change in MVC torque was clearly correlated with relative changes in RMS-EMG of MG (r = 0.71; 90% confidence limits, +-0.23) and LG (r = 0.76; +-0.20) using Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient. Although we did not determine the M-wave amplitude before and after the intervention, it was reported that explosive-type training did not induce changes in M-wave amplitude of the agonist muscles. Taken together, neural adaptation mechanisms in the triceps surae appear to be responsible for the observed increase in absolute and normalized RTD and MVC torque after calf-raise training.\nOther factors that may contribute to RTD increases are changes in the architectural and mechanical properties of the muscle and/or tendon. Regarding the effect of muscle architecture, previous studies demonstrated that changes in muscle architecture of agonist muscles were associated with changes in RTD. We failed to find substantial changes in the muscle thickness of the triceps surae or MG, MG pennation angle, or fascicle length after the training period. A recent study demonstrated that sustained contraction but not explosive strength training for 12 wk increased the muscle size of the agonist muscles. With the consideration of the current and previous studies, it seems that quantitative adaptation of agonist muscles is relatively unlikely after explosive-type training. The lack of substantial change in the muscle thickness of the triceps surae suggests that no clear changes occurred in the pennation angles or fascicle lengths of LG or SOL, considering the positive associations between the magnitudes of muscle hypertrophy and changes in the two parameters. Thus there was less impact of muscle architecture of the triceps surae on the improvement of RTD in the current study. With respect to the contribution of tendon mechanical properties, there is a positive relationship between tendon stiffness and RFD, and a training-induced increase in tendon stiffness is accompanied by an increment of RTD. In the current study, there was no substantial change in EMDMG after the training program. The EMDMG is associated with the Achilles tendon stiffness, and a decrease of EMDMG after resistance training paralleled an increase in the Achilles tendon stiffness. Moreover, it was suggested that high-intensity training is required to induce an increase in the tendon stiffness of agonist muscles. These previous findings suggest a lack of clear change in the Achilles tendon stiffness following the present training program (i.e., low-intensity exercise using body mass). Accordingly, it is unlikely that the improvement of RTD of the plantar flexion resulted from changes in musculotendinous factors of the triceps surae in the current study.\nThere were clear (moderate) individual differences in the effect of training on RTDpeak. Although the SD of individual responses in MVC torque was unclear, the threshold could have been moderate considering the uncertainty. Because the current exercise protocol was body-mass based, the variability of each value relative to body mass at baseline may be one of the factors that results in the variability of training responses. Indeed, in the training group, there were clear negative correlations between relative change in RTDpeak (r = -0.62; 90% confidence limits, +-0.27) or MVC torque (r = -0.76; +-0.19) and the values relative to body mass at baseline. These findings suggest that great responses on rapid and maximal plantar flexion force generations are expected to occur in individuals who have relatively low capability of producing plantar flexion force.\nWe failed to find a beneficial effect on COP speed, whereas substantial reduction of muscle activations of MG and SOL was observed. It has been shown that there was a positive correlation between COP displacement and magnitude of RMS-EMG of the lower leg in young and elderly individuals and has been suggested that impaired postural stability (i.e., large COP speed in the present study) in elderly people could be due to excessive activation of the triceps surae. To explore the contribution of changes in muscle activations to change in COP speed with baseline adjustment to overall mean, change scores of RMS-EMG in each muscle were dealt with as covariate in the spreadsheet. As a result of adjusting to zero change of the covariate, the effect was reduced from 0.3 to 8% with adjustment for MG, 9% for LG, and 0.6% for SOL. Consistent with the results, there were clear relationships between relative change in COP speed and relative changes in RMS-EMGs of MG (r = 0.48; 90% confidence limits, +-0.33) and LG (r = 0.67; +-0.25) in the training group. Adjustment for changes in RTD was also performed, and reduction of the training effect was shown to be from 0.3 to 0.8-3% at 10-150 ms but was not observed at later phases. These results suggest that calf-raise training-induced adaptations of the triceps surae activations and explosive plantar flexion strength at early phases beneficially affect static balance performance. The reasons for the lack of clear change in COP speed after the intervention are unclear, but likely harmful change on TA activation during single-leg standing may diminish the training effect on COP speed. Indeed, the adjustment for change in TA activation increased the effect from 0.3 to -3%. In contrast, given the means and uncertainty of the effect on COP speed, benefit could be small to moderate. Moreover, individual responses to training were unclear (-12%; +-18%), but the threshold could have been moderate considering the uncertainty. The means and uncertainty of the SD of individual responses were not substantially different even if we determined the values without adjustment for baseline (-10%; +-18%), implying that the baseline data did not affect substantially interindividual variability of training response. The negative value may be partly due to sampling variation, but if we ignore the uncertainties in the means and SD, then the effect on individuals could reach borderline small-moderate. Taken together, the present calf-raise training may potentially contribute to recover from reduced balance performance in elderly individuals. To detect clear training effect on balance performance, further studies are required.\nIn the present study, there was a difference in body position and equipment between the calf-raise exercise (standing position) and strength testing (sitting position). Although the current findings corroborate previous results that explosive-type training improves RFD of the lower extremity, training has been performed at high intensity in the previous studies, and several studies have used the same apparatus for training and RFD evaluation. Thus specificity of the training and/or learning effects may be inherent in the results of previous studies, and the transferability of the strength from the training mode to other tasks remains questionable. The lack of RFD change in the control group in the previous studies cannot rule out the above possibilities, because the control group would have occasion to use the apparatus only twice (i.e., measurements before and after the intervention), but the training group would use the equipment during training, as well as for performance measurements. Blazevich suggested that the intent to move rapidly is not a major factor for the improvement of RFD if there is some specificity with respect to the training and testing exercises, whereas the intent is important when the test exercise is not specific to the training program. The current results support the notion of Blazevich. We need to take into account these points when considering training programs for functional improvement in elderly people.\nCalf-raise training using body mass at high speed does not require any special equipment or venue, thereby simplifying continuation of the exercise by elderly people. Therefore, the current exercise program can be applied to rehabilitation or training at home. Recovery from a decrease in RFD after disuse is attenuated in elderly people. This indicates that elderly people live their everyday lives with a large risk of falling after recovery from diseases and/or injuries. The prevention of decrement of the plantar flexion RFD is crucial, considering its association with maximum walking speed and risk of falling. The current exercise protocol can be of great benefit to elderly individuals who have impaired functional ability in daily life and who have difficulty in exercising at high intensity.\nA methodological consideration is possible foot movement during strength testing. Although we fixed the subject's foot on the plate of the dynamometer very tightly, slight foot movements, accompanied by changes of ankle joint angle, may have occurred during contractions. It is likely that such movement would induce larger muscle shortening of the triceps surae during isometric contractions, resulting in lower RTD at a time point. In addition, a small number of contractions and the use of the same contractions to assess RTD and MVC torque were limitations of the methods. These points may have underestimated the training-induced response in RTD but do not change the interpretation of the main findings in the current study.\nIn summary, the present study revealed that home-based, high-speed calf-raise training for 8 wk improves the rapid force-generating capability of the plantar flexion. The training-induced increment of the variables was accompanied by substantial changes in muscle activation of the trained muscles rather than musculotendinous factors. Although the training effect on standing balance performance was clinically trivial, the changes in triceps surae muscle activations during standing were substantial. Moreover, training-induced enhancement of the explosive plantar flexion strength at early phases was suggested to contribute beneficially to the standing balance performance. Such neuromuscular adaptations are expected to result in balance performance improvement.

However, no clear relationship has been established between these two factors in elderly population.\n This study aimed to examine the association between plantar flexion strength and balance performance in elderly men and women.\n Forty-three men and 35 women aged over 65years performed isometric plantar flexion as fast and hard as possible.\n From the time-torque curve, the rate of torque development in time intervals of 30, 50, 100, 150, and 200ms from the onset of contraction was determined and normalized to peak torque.\n In addition, the center of pressure displacement during single-leg standing was calculated and normalized to height.\n When the data were collapsed over sexes, the normalized rate of torque development was negatively correlated with the normalized center of pressure displacement, except for the time interval of 200ms.\n By sex, regardless of the time interval, there was a negative correlation between the normalized rate of torque development and the normalized center of pressure displacement in the elderly men but not in the elderly women.\n No correlation was seen between the peak torque and normalized center of pressure displacement in either pooled or separated data.\n The findings suggest that the capability of rapid force production rather than maximal force production of the plantar flexion is important for balance ability in elderly men, but this capability may not be relevant in elderly women.\n","id":"PMC5266226","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Springer International

18 and 90 years old that included EF.\n The aim was to identify a threshold of torque below which balance is compromised.\n The MIT of Plantar flexors (PFs) and dorsal flexors (DFs) and CoP were measured in 90 volunteers: 21 healthy young adults (YA) (age: 24.1  5.0), 12 healthy middle-aged adults (MAA) (age: 50.2  4.5), 27 healthy elderly non-fallers (ENF) (age: 75.5  7.0) and 30 EF (age: 78.8  6.7).\n The MIT of PF and DF were summed to obtain the overall maximal ankle muscle strength.\n Body weight and height were used to normalize MIT (nMIT) and CoP (nCoP), respectively.\n nCoP correlated negatively with nMIT.\n 90% of EF generated an nMIT &lt;3.1 Nmkg?1, whereas 85% of non-fallers generated an nMIT &gt;3.1 Nmkg?1.\n The relationship between nMIT and nCoP implies that ankle muscle weakness contributes to increased postural instability and the risk of falling.\n We observed that below the threshold of 3.1 Nmkg?1, postural stability was dramatically diminished and balance was compromised.\n Our results suggest that measuring ankle torque could be used in routine clinical practice to identify potential fallers.\n","id":"PMC4271599","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Frontiers Media

development during rapid contractions has recently become quite popular for characterising explosive strength of athletes, elderly individuals and patients.\n The main aims of this narrative review are to describe the neuromuscular determinants of rate of force development and to discuss various methodological considerations inherent to its evaluation for research and clinical purposes.\n Rate of force development (1) seems to be mainly determined by the capacity to produce maximal voluntary activation in the early phase of an explosive contraction (first 5075ms), particularly as a result of increased motor unit discharge rate; (2) can be improved by both explosive-type and heavy-resistance strength training in different subject populations, mainly through an improvement in rapid muscle activation; (3) is quite difficult to evaluate in a valid and reliable way.\n Therefore, we provide evidence-based practical recommendations for rational quantification of rate of force development in both laboratory and clinical settings.\n","id":"PMC4875063","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","authors":[{"firstname":"Nicola

POSTNATAL DIFFERENTIATION OF RAT SKELETAL MUSCLE","abstract":" An electron microscope study has been carried out on rat psoas muscle, during the early postnatal stages of development.\n Among the several subcellular components, the sarcotubular system undergoes the most striking modifications during this period.\n In muscle fibers of the newborn rat, junctional contacts between the T system and the SR are sparse and are, mostly, longitudinally or obliquely oriented.\n The T tubules do not penetrate deeply into the muscle cell, as indicated by the predominantly peripheral location of the triads and the persistence, at these stages of development, of a highly branched subsarcolemmal system of tubules.\n Diadic associations of junctional SR elements with the plasma membrane are also occasionally observed.\n The early SR elaborations incompletely delineate the myofibrils, at both the A- and I-band level.\n Longitudinal sections show irregularly oriented SR tubules, running continuously over successive sarcomeres.\n Flattened junctional cisterns filled with granular material are sparse and laterally interconnected, at circumscribed sites, with the SR tubules.\n Between 1 and 2 wk postpartum, transversal triadic contacts are extensively established, at the A-I band level, and the SR network differentiates into two portions in register with the A and I band, respectively.\n At 1015 days after birth, the SR provides a transversely continuous double sheet around the myofibrils at the I-band level, whereas it forms a single discontinuous layer at the A-band level.\n The relationship that these morphological modifications of the sarcotubular system may bear to previously described biochemical and physiological changes of rat muscle fibers after birth is discussed.\n ","id":"PMC2107825","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"The Rockefeller University

25 studies), but had small effects on measures of muscle morphology (mean SMDbs=0.42; nine studies).\n\n Specifically, RT produced large effects in both 1RM of upper (mean SMDbs=1.61; 11 studies) and lower (mean SMDbs=1.76; 19 studies) extremities and a medium effect in MVC of lower (mean SMDbs=0.76; four studies) extremities.\n\n Results of the meta-regression revealed that the variables training period (p=0.04) and intensity (p&lt;0.01) as well as total time under tension (p&lt;0.01) had significant effects on muscle strength, with the largest effect sizes for the longest training periods (mean SMDbs=2.34; 5053weeks), intensities of 7079% of the 1RM (mean SMDbs=1.89), and total time under tension of 6.0s (mean SMDbs=3.61).\n\n A tendency towards significance was found for rest in between sets (p=0.06), with 60s showing the largest effect on muscle strength (mean SMDbs=4.68; two studies).\n\n We also determined the independent effects of the remaining training variables on muscle strength.\n\n The following independently computed training variables are most effective in improving measures of muscle strength: a training frequency of two sessions per week (mean SMDbs=2.13), a training volume of two to three sets per exercise (mean SMDbs=2.99), seven to nine repetitions per set (mean SMDbs=1.98), and a rest of 4.0s between repetitions (SMDbs=3.72).\n\n With regard to measures of muscle morphology, the small number of identified studies allowed us to calculate meta-regression for the subcategory training volume only.\n\n No single training volume variable significantly predicted RT effects on measures of muscle morphology.\n\n Additional training variables were independently computed to detect the largest effect for the single training variable.\n\n A training period of 5053weeks, a training frequency of three sessions per week, a training volume of two to three sets per exercise, seven to nine repetitions per set, a training intensity from 51 to 69% of the 1RM, a total time under tension of 6.0s, a rest of 120s between sets, and a rest of 2.5s between repetitions turned out to be most effective.\n\n\nLimitations\nThe current results must be interpreted with caution because of the poor overall methodological study quality (mean PEDro score 4.6 points) and the considerable large heterogeneity (I2=80%, ?2=163.1, df=32, p&lt;0.01) for muscle strength.\n\n In terms of muscle morphology, our search identified nine studies only, which is why we consider our findings preliminary.\n\n While we were able to determine a doseresponse relationship based on specific individual training variables with respect to muscle strength and morphology, it was not possible to ascertain any potential interactions between these variables.\n\n We recognize the limitation that the results may not represent one general doseresponse relationship.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis systematic literature review and meta-analysis confirmed the effectiveness of RT on specific measures of upper and lower extremity muscle strength and muscle morphology in healthy old adults.\n\n In addition, we were able to extract doseresponse relationships for key training variables (i.\n\ne.\n\n, volume, intensity, rest), informing clinicians and practitioners to design effective RTs for muscle strength and morphology.\n\n Training period, intensity, time under tension, and rest in between sets play an important role in improving muscle strength and morphology and should be implemented in exercise training programs targeting healthy old adults.\n\n Still, further research is needed to reveal optimal doseresponse relationships following RT in healthy as well as mobility limited and/or frail old adults.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4656698","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Springer International Publishing","authors":[{"firstname":"Ron","surname":"Borde","email":"rborde@uni-potsdam.de","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tibor","surname":"Hortobgyi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Urs","surname":"Granacher","email":"urs.granacher@uni-potsdam.de","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1007/s12662-011-0218-4","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Effects of balance and resistance training in children, adolescents, and seniors","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1186/1471-2318-12-68","date":"2012-11-03","title":"Residual effects of muscle strength and muscle power training and detraining on physical function in community-dwelling prefrail older adults: a randomized controlled trial","abstract":"Background\nAlthough resistance exercise interventions have been shown to be beneficial in prefrail or frail older adults it remains unclear whether there are residual effects when the training is followed by a period of detraining.\n\n The aim of this study was to establish the sustainability of a muscle power or muscle strength training effect in prefrail older adults following training and detraining.\n\n\nMethods\n69 prefrail community-dwelling older adults, aged 6594 years were randomly assigned into three groups: muscle strength training (ST), muscle power training (PT) or controls.\n\n The exercise interventions were performed for 60 minutes, twice a week over 12 weeks.\n\n Physical function (Short Physical Performance Battery=SPPB), muscle power (sit-to-stand transfer=STS), self-reported function (SF-LLFDI) and appendicular lean mass (aLM) were measured at baseline and at 12, 24 and 36 weeks after the start of the intervention.\n\n\nResults\nFor the SPPB, significant intervention effects were found at 12 weeks in both exercise groups (ST: p = 0.0047;

The causes of frailty are multifactorial, including genetic, environmental, physical, and nutritional factors. Frailty is considered an age-related deficiency in both the physiological and psychological domains. The results from a systematic review reported that the prevalence of frailty increased with age. With rapid and tremendous growth of the older population over the past two decades, frailty deserves special attention. Conceptualization of the design and execution of effective frailty prevention and management protocols are necessary because frail people have high risks of adverse health outcomes, such as functional disability, hospitalization, and death.\nOur previous study determined that older adults with a dietary pattern with large amounts phytonutrient-rich plant foods and protein-rich foods had a lower risk of frailty than their counterparts did. Recent studies have also shown that frailty can be improved and managed through suitable interventions. Exercise and nutrition interventions are two major non-pharmacological approaches that are effective in improving muscle mass, functional ability (mobility and activities of daily living), fitness levels, and cognitive functions. Because frailty is comprised of multiple correlated functional declines, multicomponent interventions for frailty prevention has received attention. However, most interventional programs are conducted at centers or designed as group activities; consequently, the programs are less accessible to older adults who are not willing to travel regularly to these centers. Hence, the development of home-based, self-practiced, multicomponent intervention protocols for managing frailty in outpatient facilities is advisable.\nTo our knowledge, studies on home-based multicomponent interventions for frailty syndrome management are still limited. Therefore, in this study, individualized home-based exercise and nutrition interventions were developed to assist older adults who seek clinical help. We hypothesized that this intervention program is efficient in improving not only the frailty scores but also related physical and mental health outcomes for pre-frail or frail older adults.\nMethods\nStudy design and participants\nThis study was a four-arm, single-blind, randomized controlled trial that was conducted between October 2015 and June 2017 in the outpatient clinics of Miaoli General Hospital in Taiwan and registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03477097). The Institutional Review Board on Biomedical Science Research of Academia Sinica in Taiwan approved the protocol, informed consent form, and case report forms (AS-IRB01-15020). All participants signed the informed consent forms. This study followed the CONSORT guidelines for reporting.\nIn outpatient clinics, individuals aged &gt;=65 years of age were invited to participate in this study. Trained case managers screened the frail or pre-frail older adults by using the Cardiovascular Health Study Criteria. Participants who were non-frail, were unable to walk a 14-m distance independently; had severe illnesses (e.g., cancer), severe depression (Geriatric Depression Scale [GDS] &gt;= 10), cognitive impairment (Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] score &lt; 24 for the literate older adults or &lt; 18 for the illiterate); had communication impairment, were hospitalized or were living in a nursing home, had participated in other studies; or were taking nutritional supplements at the time of recruitment were excluded.\nThe trained case managers evaluated older adults for eligibility by using a comprehensive geriatric assessment and physical performance tests (e.g., handgrip strength, gait speed). Those who were eligible and provided informed consent were randomly assigned into one of the four study groups: control, exercise, nutrition, and combination (exercise plus nutrition), each with 3-month intervention and 3-month self-maintenance periods. The permuted-block randomization (12 per block) procedure was used. They were then referred to licensed physiotherapists or dietitians for further individualized evaluation and intervention.\nIntervention contents\nThe exercise intervention consisted of a combination of strength, flexibility, balance, and endurance training based on the guidelines of the American College of Sports Medicine. At the outset, the trained case managers evaluated the physical fitness of each participant based on multiple facets (handgrip strength, gait speed, upper and lower body flexibility, lower extremity strength, balance and leg strength, and volume of physical activity). In order to enhance participants' fitness levels, the participants received personalized (fitted to individual needs) exercise prescriptions and handy tools (e.g., resistance band, grip-ball, and pedometer) from the licensed physiotherapists. Approximately 3 to 7 exercise sessions per week were recommended, with the time (5 to 60 min) per session or repetitions tailored to participants' capabilities. Each participant in the exercise and combination groups was encouraged to perform a 6-month home-based training. The performance of daily exercise was recorded in an exercise diary.\nThe underlying concept of nutrition intervention was to maintain a desirable body weight by maintaining an appropriate level of caloric intake achieved through a designated number of servings (as suggested by the Taiwanese Food Guide) of six food groups (dairy; protein-rich foods; vegetables; fruits; nuts, seeds, plant oils; and grains or roots). Caloric requirements were appraised considering the age, sex, height, weight, and physical activity levels of the participants. The participants received a set of customized dishware, including a plate with four compartments for vegetables and protein foods, a bowl for rice and fruits, a mug for milk and juice, and a tablespoon. A colored meal pad was given to indicate the personalized food amount on the dishware, which was designed to help participants easily obtain the correct amounts of rice, protein foods, fruits, vegetables, milk, and nuts or seeds. The detailed description of this dietary intervention method and customized dishware was as previously published. Moreover, participants in the nutrition and combination groups were asked to record the number of servings they consumed from each of the six food groups (bowl for rice, mug for milk, compartment for protein foods and vegetables, fist-size for fruits, and a tablespoon for nuts or seeds).\nIn addition, the following two food supplements were provided: 25 g of skim milk powder a day and 10 g of mixed nuts a day (cashews, almonds, pumpkin seeds, walnuts, macadamia nuts, and pine nuts) (nutrition-1 subgroup).\nOxidative stress of aging has been associated with sarcopenia, and no clear evidence exists in the literature regarding the protective effect of antioxidant supplementation. In addition, the potential of fish oil to manage anabolic resistance to protein in sarcopenia is well known. Therefore, we randomly provided half of the participants in the nutrition and combination groups additional nutritional supplements, including three fish oil capsules and one vegetable and fruit concentrate capsule per day (nutrition-2 subgroup). Each fish oil capsule (500 mg/capsule) contained 140 mg of eicosapentaenoic acid and 95 mg of docosahexaenoic acid (DSM MEG-3  3322EE Oil). Each 200 mg vegetable and fruit capsule contained water- and ethanol-extracted vegetable and fruit concentrate (Oxxynea  FP) with an anti-oxidative potential equivalent to four servings of fruits and vegetables. However, because the fish oil and vegetable and fruit concentrate did not exert any additional effect in this trial, we present the overall findings of the nutrition intervention.\nPatient management\nAll participants were contacted by telephone by case managers on the third day after the first intervention. After this, participants followed the following schedule: visiting case managers, physiotherapists, or dietitians in person at the end of the first month, receiving a telephone call at the end of the second month, and making additional visits in person to case managers, physiotherapists, or dietitians at the end of the third and sixth months. Moreover, the participants in the intervention groups received inspirational cards at the 1-month and 3-month follow-ups, encouraging them to maintain their designated intervention schedules.\nThe physiotherapists and dietitians called and encouraged the subjects in the exercise and nutrition arms on the third day and in the second month. At the end of 1-month and 3-month follow-ups, physiotherapists and dieticians examined the exercise and dietary diaries of each participant. The interventions were modified to suit participants' individual needs if participants did not achieve the desired amount of exercise or target dietary goals because of health-related reasons (e.g., muscle pain, decrease in appetite, weight loss, or weight gain of more than 5%) in the preceding months. The physiotherapists and dietitians also encouraged the participants to maintain their exercise and balanced diet practices during the next 4-6 months.\nAs mentioned, participants in the combination group received both exercise and nutrition interventions, and those in the control group underwent regular medical care without any interventions except telephone contacts (for greeting only) by case managers on the third day and at the end of the second month.\nDietary compliance\nThe compliance with dietary consultation was assessed. Using the dietary recall method and aids, such as food models and measuring dishware, licensed dietitians assessed the dietary intake within the preceding month by inquiring about the participants' typical dietary patterns, most frequently consumed items, and the amount of these foods eaten at breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snack times. If a participant had several types of meals, drinks, or snack patterns at these time points, all were documented and weighted by the consumption probability (estimated from the frequency) to obtain an average intake profile. In addition, the discrepancies between recall and diary were clarified. The dietary intake data were transformed into nutrient data, including total calories, protein, carbohydrate, and fat, by using a computerized worksheet based on the Taiwan Food Nutrient Database. The method to estimate serving numbers of the six food groups is provided in the Appendix.\nFor compliance, we checked and tested the changes in protein, fat, and carbohydrate (for both weight [g/day] and percentage calorie contribution [%]) and changes in serving numbers of the six food groups per the nutrition intervention and exercise intervention statuses because the interaction between the nutrition and exercise interventions was not significant.\nAssessment of frailty and other measurements\nThe single-blind assessments of all participants were conducted at baseline, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months by trained case managers who were unaware of which intervention group participants belonged.\nThe primary outcome of this study was the frailty score, which was quantified based on the Cardiovascular Health Study Criteria developed by Fried and colleagues. The criteria comprise five components: unintentional weight loss, exhaustion, poor muscle strength, slowness, and low physical activity. Unintentional weight loss was defined as involuntary loss of &gt; 3 kg (or 5%) of body weight in the preceding year. Exhaustion was assessed by responses to the following question: &quot;How often in the last week did you feel that you could not get going?&quot; If participants' response indicated more than 3 days, they were considered positive for the exhaustion component. Poor muscle strength and slowness were respectively assessed based on handgrip strength and gait speed. Handgrip strength was evaluated using a standard hydraulic hand dynamometer (Baseline , Fabrication Enterprises, Inc., NY, USA), and gait speed was evaluated using a 10-m walk test with 2 m added at the beginning and end of the pathway to eliminate the effects of acceleration and deceleration. The sex- and body mass index-specific cut-off points and the sex- and height-specific cut-off points were used to identify low handgrip strength and slow gait speed, respectively. Moreover, physical activity was evaluated using the Taiwan International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)-Short Form for the Elderly (Taiwanese version of IPAQ, plus an additional assessment of light activity); sex-specific cut-off points were employed to assess low physical activity. For the five frailty criteria, a score of 1 was given if a criterion was met. The total scores ranged between 0 and 5, and participants would be classified as frailty (three or more scores), pre-frailty (one or two scores), or robustness states (zero score).\nThe secondary outcomes of this study included evaluations of physical performance and mental health status. For physical performance, we measured handgrip strength, gait speed, upper body flexibility (back scratch), lower body flexibility (chair sit-and-reach), and lower extremity strength (standing heel-rise). The mental health outcomes composed of the GDS and 12-Item Short Form Health Survey mental component summary (SF-12 MCS) scores.\nSample size calculation\nThe previous study had reported that the significant difference in the frailty score between the exercise and control groups was 0.23 after the 6-month intervention. We postulated that exercise plus nutrition intervention would offer a better reduction in the frailty score than the exercise intervention alone. Accordingly, sample size calculation was based on an assumed reduction in the frailty score of 0.3 points between the three intervention groups and the control group. We assumed that the correlations among repeated measures were 0.2. The requirement of minimum sample size in each group was 66 participants to reach the statistical significance at an overall significance level of 0.05 and a power of 80%. In addition, the total sample size was 320 by assuming a 20% attrition during follow-up. The sample size calculation was performed using the G*Power analysis program.\nStatistical analysis\nThe participants' baseline demographics and health-related characteristics among the designated groups were expressed as mean +- standard deviation (SD) or number (percentage) for continuous variables or categorical variables, respectively. The Kruskal-Wallis test, chi-square test, and Fisher's exact test were performed to assess the differences in baseline measurements among the designated groups. This trial was analyzed based on the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle, and the last observation carried forward method was utilized to impute missing values owing to participants dropping out or being lost to follow-up. Comparisons of intervention effects over time on measured outcomes were implemented using the linear mixed-effects models. In the models, &quot;changes from baseline&quot; in frailty score and secondary outcomes were considered response variables; explanatory variables included the intervention groups, time effect, and interaction between the intervention groups and time effect. In addition, to consider correlations among the repeated measures for each participant, an autoregressive correlation structure was used, which assumed that successive measures correlated more highly than non-successive measures for the same participant. The statistical significance of all tests was evaluated at a predetermined significance level of 0.05, and post hoc tests between the three intervention groups and the control group were assessed at an adjusted significance level of 0.017 by using the Bonferroni correction. All data analyses were carried out using the SAS statistical software version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).\nResults\nFlow chart of study participants in the frailty intervention randomized controlled trial.

dChange from baseline\nThe results of the compliance with dietary consultation are presented in Table 3. We examined for any differences in the baseline mean or changes at 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months by exercise intervention status and by nutrition intervention status. Because of no interaction effects between the exercise and nutrition interventions, the statistical testing results of the exercise and nutrition intervention effects are presented separately. At baseline, no statistically significant differences were observed for both the exercise and nutrition intervention statuses for any of the dietary parameters that we examined. Notably, the nutrition intervention increased the intake levels of total calories, protein, carbohydrate, and fat at 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months. For investigation of energy from these macronutrients, the percentage of calories from protein increased significantly at all three follow-up time points in the group that received the nutrition intervention. No statistically significant changes for percent of calories were observed in carbohydrate and fat, except at 1 month (small decrease in carbohydrate and small increase in fat). This observation was because of the significant increases in the servings of dairy, beans/fish/meat/eggs, and oils/nuts. Vegetable consumption was approximately three servings a day at baseline, and no changes were seen. A significant, albeit modest, increase (less than half of serving) was observed for fruits. \nIntervention effects on physical performance and mental health outcomes during the 6-month study period\n		Mean +- SD	Difference in difference: change from baseline in each intervention group minus change from baseline in control group (95% CI)	p for groups x time interaction	p for groups	p for time	 	Outcomes		Control	Exercise	Nutrition	Combination	Exercise	Nutrition	Combination	 	Handgrip strength (kg)	n	80	79	82	77				0.004	0.023	&lt;  0.001	 	Baseline	25.0 +- 7.8	24.5 +- 7.7	24.9 +- 9.2	26.9 +- 8.5							 	1 month	25.1 +- 7.8	25.4 +- 8.6	24.9 +- 9.2	27.6 +- 8.4	0.91 (0.06, 1.75)	-0.05 (- 0.89, 0.78)	0.65 (- 0.19, 1.50)				 	3 months	25.1 +- 7.7	25.6 +- 8.8	25.8 +- 9.1	27.8 +- 8.5	1.10 (0.25, 1.94)a	0.83 (- 0.01, 1.66)	0.81 (- 0.04, 1.66)				 	6 months	25.3 +- 7.7	26.7 +- 8.7	26.3 +- 8.9	28.5 +- 8.7	2.00 (1.16, 2.84)a	1.09 (0.26, 1.93)a	1.30 (0.45, 2.14)a				 	10-m gait speed (seconds)	n	80	79	83	77				0.159	0.226	&lt;  0.001	 	Baseline	10.7 +- 3.2	12.5 +- 7.7	13.0 +- 7.4	11.4 +- 4.3							 	1 month	10.6 +- 3.2	12.2 +- 8.1	12.4 +- 6.9	11.1 +- 4.0	-0.21 (- 0.78, 0.35)	- 0.48 (-1.04, 0.08)	- 0.20 (- 0.77, 0.37)				 	3 months	10.6 +- 3.3	12.3 +- 8.5	12.4 +- 6.8	10.9 +- 3.8	- 0.14 (- 0.70, 0.43)	- 0.56 (- 1.12, 0.003)	- 0.49 (- 1.06, 0.08)				 	6 months	10.8 +- 3.4	12.1 +- 8.1	12.3 +- 6.5	10.7 +- 3.4	-0.41 (- 0.98, 0.16)	- 0.81 (- 1.37, - 0.25)a	-0.81 (- 1.38, - 0.24)a				 	Upper body flexibility (cm)	n	76	73	76	73				&lt;  0.001	0.020	0.408	 	Baseline	-13.9 +- 12.3	- 12.9 +- 16.7	-13.2 +- 12.0	-12.4 +- 12.5							 	1 month	-14.6 +- 12.2	- 13.1 +- 14.5	-13.1 +- 12.4	-11.4 +- 12.4	0.49 (- 1.62, 2.60)	0.82 (- 1.27, 2.90)	1.71 (-0.40, 3.82)				 	3 months	-15.8 +- 10.0	- 12.2 +- 13.3	-14.5 +- 10.0	-11.3 +- 13.3	2.54 (0.43, 4.65)	0.54 (- 1.55, 2.63)	3.07 (0.96, 5.18)a				 	6 months	-16.9 +- 10.5	-10.6 +- 12.7	-14.3 +- 10.3	-10.5 +- 12.5	5.21 (3.10, 7.31)a	1.86 (- 0.23, 3.94)	4.92 (2.81, 7.03)a				 	Lower body flexibility (cm)	n	76	75	79	74				0.037	0.020	0.810	 	Baseline	-4.6 +- 8.9	-2.9 +- 8.5	-5.2 +- 8.1	-3.3 +- 7.6							 	1 month	-5.5 +- 8.2	-2.1 +- 8.5	-5.4 +- 7.5	-3.0 +- 7.4	1.76 (0.39, 3.13)a	0.69 (-0.66, 2.05)	1.27 (-0.11, 2.65)				 	3 months	-5.5 +- 7.9	-2.0 +- 8.6	-5.6 +- 7.3	-2.2 +- 6.8	1.76 (0.39, 3.14)a	0.45 (-0.90, 1.81)	2.00 (0.63, 3.38)a				 	6 months	-5.8 +- 8.1	-1.8 +- 9.0	-6.0 +- 7.4	-2.3 +- 7.2	2.33 (0.96, 3.70)a	0.39 (-0.97, 1.74)	2.17 (0.79, 3.55)a				 	Lower extremity strength (number)	n	69	61	70	64				&lt;  0.001	&lt;  0.001	&lt;  0.001	 	Baseline	1.6 +- 3.0	3.9 +- 5.2	2.0 +- 3.3	3.8 +- 4.3							 	1 month	1.8 +- 3.1	5.3 +- 6.0	2.1 +- 3.5	5.7 +- 6.0	1.25 (0.30, 2.21)a	-0.07 (-1.00, 0.85)	1.70 (0.76, 2.65)a				 	3 months	1.8 +- 3.0	5.8 +- 5.8	2.0 +- 3.4	6.9 +- 6.6	1.74 (0.78, 2.70)a	-0.12 (-1.04, 0.81)	2.93 (1.99, 3.88)a				 	6 months	1.7 +- 2.9	6.9 +- 6.7	2.4 +- 3.5	8.0 +- 7.0	2.95 (1.99, 3.90)a	0.34 (-0.58, 1.26)	4.05 (3.11, 5.00)a				 	GDS (scores)	n	80	79	83	77				0.497	0.343	0.255	 	Baseline	2.2 +- 1.7	2.5 +- 1.8	2.6 +- 1.9	2.4 +- 1.6							 	1 month	2.4 +- 1.9	2.5 +- 1.7	2.6 +- 2.0	2.3 +- 1.4	-0.19 (-0.62, 0.25)	-0.20 (- 0.63, 0.23)	- 0.32 (- 0.76, 0.12)				 	3 months	2.5 +- 1.8	2.6 +- 1.7	2.4 +- 1.8	2.3 +- 1.6	- 0.15 (- 0.58, 0.29)	-0.45 (- 0.89, - 0.02)	-0.37 (- 0.81, 0.07)				 	6 months	2.4 +- 1.7	2.3 +- 1.6	2.4 +- 1.9	2.2 +- 1.6	-0.43 (- 0.86, 0.01)	- 0.42 (- 0.85, 0.01)	-0.38 (- 0.82, 0.06)				 	SF-12 MCS (scores)	n	80	79	83	76				0.567	0.624	&lt;  0.001	 	Baseline	53.8 +- 7.9	53.9 +- 8.1	53.4 +- 7.8	55.8 +- 7.0							 	1 month	54.5 +- 7.7	54.4 +- 8.3	53.9 +- 8.0	56.3 +- 6.7	-0.22 (-1.87, 1.43)	-0.24 (-1.87, 1.39)	- 0.22 (- 1.89, 1.44)				 	3 months	54.0 +- 7.7	55.2 +- 7.9	55.0 +- 6.1	57.0 +- 6.3	1.09 (- 0.56, 2.74)	1.33 (- 0.30, 2.96)	0.94 (- 0.73, 2.60)				 	6 months	54.3 +- 7.1	55.9 +- 6.9	56.0 +- 5.9	57.3 +- 6.6	1.58 (-0.07, 3.23)	2.12 (0.49, 3.75)a	1.05 (-0.61, 2.72)				 	\nCI confidence interval; GDS Geriatric Depression Scale; SF-12 MCS 12-Item Short Form Health Survey mental component summary; aPairwise comparisons (interventions vs. control) were significant at the post hoc significance level of 0.017\nThe results of intervention effects on physical performance and mental health outcomes are summarized in Table 4. Significant interaction effects between the intervention groups and time were observed regarding handgrip strength (p = 0.004), upper body flexibility (p &lt;  0.001), lower body flexibility (p = 0.037), and lower extremity strength (p &lt;  0.001). Significant main effects observed in the intervention groups were regarding handgrip strength (p = 0.023), upper body flexibility (p = 0.020), lower body flexibility (p = 0.020), and lower extremity strength (p &lt;  0.001). No statistically significant interaction effects were observed between the intervention groups and time, and the main effects of the intervention groups in 10-m gait speed. After the 6-month follow-up, compared with the control group, the beneficial improvements in handgrip strength were observed in the exercise (difference in handgrip strength change from baseline: 2.00; 95% CI: 1.16, 2.84; p &lt;  0.001), nutrition (1.09; 95% CI: 0.26, 1.93; p = 0.011), and combination (1.30; 95% CI: 0.45, 2.14; p = 0.003) groups. Moreover, significant improvements in physical performance were observed in 10-m gait speed, upper body flexibility, lower body flexibility, and lower extremity strength in the exercise, nutrition, and combination intervention groups at 6 months. \nIn the mental health outcomes, significant interaction effects were not seen between the intervention groups and time, and the main effects of the intervention groups in GDS and SF-12 MCS. At the 6-month follow-up, the SF-12 MCS score change from baseline was significantly greater in the nutrition group than in the control group (difference in score change from baseline: 2.12; 95% CI: 0.49, 3.75; p = 0.011) (Table 4).\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we randomized the pre-frail or frail older adults into four designated groups : exercise, nutrition, combination, and control : to perform a 3-month individualized intervention and 3-month self-maintenance program at home. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first randomized controlled trial to assess the effects of individualized home-based exercise and nutrition interventions on frailty management for the pre-frail or frail older adults. Our results support the hypothesis that an individualized home-based interventions program ameliorate frailty and improve physical and mental health outcomes for pre-frail or frail older adults. Our program was a genuinely home-based intervention because the personal contact between the participants and professionals lasted for only 1 h for a baseline evaluation, 5 min on the third day, 5 min at the end of the second month for a telephone greeting, and 30 min at the 1-month and 3-month follow-ups for reassessment and prescription revision. The cost of this home-based intervention program was considerably low, and the 3-month program costs per participant (including expenditures for program materials and professional time) were USD 29, USD 57-78, and USD 81-100 for those in the exercise, nutrition, and combination groups, respectively. Another innovative approach was the use of inspirational cards to increase participants' compliance. The novelty of this intervention program was to translate a professional prescription of individualized physical and nutritional intervention into a handy program that could be effectively carried out by community-dwelling older adults at home.\nPrevious studies have shown that physical exercise helps older adults increase muscle strength, increase brain volume (gray and white matter regions), and help them to prevent falls. Moreover, physical exercise improve the mobility and physical functioning of older adults with mobility problems, physical disability, or multiple morbidities. The effects of exercise training have been validated for older adults, irrespective of whether they are in robust condition or with functional impairment. Notably, frail older adults are at high risk for multiple comorbidities and adverse events. However, intervention studies to improve the frail conditions of pre-frail or frail older adults remain limited. This study not only recruited pre-frail or frail older adults based on well-defined criteria but also evaluated the efficacy of individualized home-based exercise and nutrition interventions for improving frailty syndrome.\nNotably, nutrition interventions for the older population have been widely proposed. Some have demonstrated the efficacy for improving adverse outcomes, such as reduction of the incidence of malnutrition and type 2 diabetes. Some studies revealed that nutritional supplements increase the total energy intake and body weight, protein intake, and usual gait speed in older adults who are at a risk of malnutrition. However, these studies did not investigate the nutritional effects on the improvement of frailty and related measurements. In this study, we demonstrated that our nutrition intervention (individualized dietary consultation plus food supplements) were effective even after food supplements were stopped and steered the dietary patterns of the participants towards the recommended diet with significant increments in the intakes of the three food groups (beans/fish/meat/eggs, dairy, and oils/nuts); this resulted in an increases in the total energy and percentage of calories from protein. Therefore, this significant shift in dietary pattern coincides with the observed positive effects such as reduced frailty scores, improved handgrip strength, and gait speed.\nMost studies agree that multicomponent interventions are promising approaches to prevent functional decline and decrease the risk of disability in older adults. Previous results have demonstrated the effectiveness of multidomain interventions on improving cognitive function, health-related quality of life, and frailty. These intervention programs were most often carried out through group sessions. However, older people are often not able to leave their home to attend such group-based programs, particularly in rural areas. Therefore, volunteer-based projects have been explored to enhance the outreach of public health care systems in disadvantaged communities. This volunteer-assisted home-based intervention program was effective in improving the malnutrition and frailty. Nonetheless, this program employed trained nonprofessional volunteers to assist older subjects at home and implement the intervention for 3 months. However, such intervention efforts could have been compromised owing to insufficient professional expertise. Moreover, some study effects could be confounded because the volunteers in the control group might have delivered the exercise or nutrition intervention information because a standardized training program was carried out for all volunteers. Compared with previous intervention studies for improving frailty syndrome, our study demonstrates that home-based exercise and nutrition interventions prescribed by professional physiotherapists and dietitians are effective not only for self-management but also for improving frailty and physical performance in pre-frail or frail older adults.\nWe observed that our exercise and nutrition intervention groups had no remarkable effects on most of the mental health outcomes, except the nutrition intervention group that exhibited a positive effect with an improved SF-12 MCS score after intervention. A previous study had also supported the beneficial effect of a nutrient-dense protein-energy liquid supplement in conjunction with active encouragement to improve food intake on the emotional role functioning. Two randomized controlled trials reported that exercise training could improve depression syndrome in older adults with depression. However, the current study observed no differences regarding GDS between the exercise and control groups. A potential explanation of this inconsistent result would be that our participants probably had healthier psychological status because we excluded those with GDS scores of &gt;=10. Therefore, additional studies should explore the effectiveness of home-based exercise and nutrition interventions on depression syndrome.\nNonetheless, some limitations of this study must be acknowledged. First, among the subjects who agreed to participate (n = 423), 84 older adults (19.86%) were excluded based on the exclusion criteria. Despite the small effects of self-selection in our study, it may affect the generalizability of our results. In addition, the generalizability of our intervention results may not apply to older adults who are not frail or have conditions listed in our exclusion criteria. From the viewpoint of frailty prevention, the effects of individualized home-based exercise and nutrition interventions require further investigation among older adults under robust conditions. Second, the 3-month intervention period was relatively short. The reduction in the frailty score between the interventions and control groups was not significantly different at the end of the third month. Instead, the effect became significant after the extended 3-month self-maintenance period when the participants in the intervention groups (exercise, nutrition, or combination) continued with self-exercise training and dietary patterns according to their designated intervention schedules. The continuing improvements in physical performance and dietary intake at 6 months could support these results. Third, we primarily showed changes in macronutrient distribution but did not calculate and compare changes in vitamin and mineral density of participants in the four groups because participants used certain commercial products for which the micronutrient information was unavailable. Nonetheless, we did report substantial dietary pattern changes in the groups receiving the dietary intervention (i.e., significant increases in the four food groups: dairy, protein foods, nuts or seeds, and fruits). Fourth, this study could not be implemented as a double-blind design; however, the outcomes measured by case managers complied with a blind assessment. Furthermore, the predetermined study purpose of this research was to evaluate the efficacy of individualized home-based exercise and nutrition interventions on overall frailty; therefore, we did not investigate each indicator of frailty separately. Consequently, we may not discern which aspect of frailty improved by the interventions. Finally, because the exercise and nutrition advice was customized per participants' capability, it may be difficult to replicate the advice. Moreover, even if replicated, it may be hard to pinpoint whether an inconsistent result is due to professionals' advice or some other factor.\nConclusions\nThis study demonstrates that individualized home-based exercise and nutrition interventions are effective in improving frailty and physical performance among community-dwelling pre-frail or frail older adults by changing their dietary intake patterns and engaging them in exercise training. Moreover, nutrition intervention may be helpful to improve the mental health in pre-frail or frail older adults. The health promotion agencies should, therefore, identify pre-frail or frail older adults from community-based hospitals, clinics, or public health stations and then implement an individualized exercise and nutrition intervention program to improve and manage frailty.\nAppendix\nMethod to estimate the servings of the six food groups\nFood groups	Definition of one serving	 	Cereal, grain, tuber	15 g of carbohydrate	 	Bean, fish, egg, poultry, meat	7 g of protein	 	Dairy	8 g of protein	 	Oil, nut, seed	5 g of fat	 	Vegetable	25 cal	 	Fruit	60 cal	 	\nWe grouped all the foods consumed to six food groups and estimated the servings of each group by its content of carbohydrate, protein, or calorie as listed in the following table. \nAbbreviations\nADL\nActivities of daily living\nBMI\nBody mass index\nCI\nConfidence interval\nGDS\nGeriatric Depression Scale\nIPAQ\nInternational Physical Activity Questionnaire\nITT\nintention-to-treat\nMMSE\nMini-Mental State Examination\nSF-12 MCS\n12-Item Short Form Health Survey mental component summary\nPublisher's Note\nSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.\nAuthors' contributions\nMHH, LC, HYC, SYC, WHP, and CCH created the study concept.

Type 2 Diabetes With the Mediterranean Diet","abstract":"OBJECTIVE\nTo test the effects of two Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) interventions versus a low-fat diet on incidence of diabetes.\n\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\nThis was a three-arm randomized trial in 418 nondiabetic subjects aged 5580 years recruited in one center (PREDIMED-Reus, northeastern Spain) of the Prevencin con Dieta Mediterrnea [PREDIMED] study, a large nutrition intervention trial for primary cardiovascular prevention in individuals at high cardiovascular risk.\n\n Participants were randomly assigned to education on a low-fat diet (control group) or to one of two MedDiets, supplemented with either free virgin olive oil (1 liter/week) or nuts (30 g/day).\n\n Diets were ad libitum, and no advice on physical activity was given.\n\n The main outcome was diabetes incidence diagnosed by the 2009 American Diabetes Association criteria.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAfter a median follow-up of 4.0 years, diabetes incidence was 10.1% (95% CI 5.115.1), 11.0% (5.916.1), and 17.9% (11.424.4) in the MedDiet with olive oil group, the MedDiet with nuts group, and the control group, respectively.\n\n Multivariable adjusted hazard ratios of diabetes were 0.49 (0.250.97) and 0.48 (0.240.96) in the MedDiet supplemented with olive oil and nuts groups, respectively, compared with the control group.\n\n When the two MedDiet groups were pooled and compared with the control group, diabetes incidence was reduced by 52% (2786).\n\n In all study arms, increased adherence to the MedDiet was inversely associated with diabetes incidence.\n\n Diabetes risk reduction occurred in the absence of significant changes in body weight or physical activity.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMedDiets without calorie restriction seem to be effective in the prevention of diabetes in subjects at high cardiovascular risk.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3005482","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"American Diabetes

[Conclusion] A 6-month home exercise program improved physical function in community-dwelling individuals with pre-sarcopenia or sarcopenia.\nINTRODUCTION\nSarcopenia is an important and common health problem in elderly individuals. The European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP)) and the Asia Working Group for Sarcopenia (AWGS)) have published an algorithm to diagnose sarcopenia based on the loss of muscle mass, and decrease in muscle strength and walking speed. The EWGSOP also defines pre-sarcopenia as an exclusive loss of muscle mass, with no symptoms.\nAmong healthy elderly women with a mean age of 71.2 years, the prevalence of sarcopenia and pre-sarcopenia was estimated at 7.6% and 13.3%, respectively). Sarcopenia has been associated with falls) and disability). The loss of muscle mass is also a risk factor for hip fractures, decreasing the compression and bending strength of the femoral neck in people aged 50 years or older with pre-sarcopenia). In fact, 58% of women with femoral neck fracture have sarcopenia, with pre-sarcopenia identified in another 17%).\nMuscle strength training can be effective in increasing muscle mass and improving physical function, such as increased muscle strength and walking speed. Kim et al.) reported achieving an increase in muscle mass and strength by combining physical exercise with supplementation of essential amino acids among community dwelling women aged over 75 years. Using weightlifting apparatus for resistance training, Binder et al.) reduced lean body mass and increased maximal voluntary force of knee extension. Kemmler et al.) achieved a reduction in lean body mass and an increase in maximum isometric strength trunk extension and leg press by combining resistance training with a program of aerobic dancing and balance exercises. However, these interventions are strictly managed, require special equipment and a facility for carrying out the exercises, and require daily supervision by instructors to adjust the training stimulus. Therefore, these programs are impractical for use as community-based programs for the prevention and management of sarcopenia.\nMuscle strength training could improve sarcopenia or pre-sarcopenia status, and overall physical function. However, elderly people are more likely to prefer resistance training methods that are 'easy to perform', and that do not require special equipment or supervision. Home exercises can provide a solution, as they do not require any particular facility, and direct guidance and coaching from instructors can be provided on a less frequent basis. Moreover, programs of home exercise are typically simple and safe to perform.\nPrevious studies have demonstrated benefit of a regimen of home exercises in improving strength in elderly individuals. Ito et al.) developed a daily program including one-minute single-leg standing and 5-6 repetitions of squats, with three sets a day. After 3 months, 87.4% of participants were still performing the program, with improvements in one-leg standing test. In a previous study, we demonstrated the effectiveness of three home exercises (single-leg standing, squats and heel-raises) in improving physical function in healthy community-dwelling adults over the age of 60 years). Therefore, in this study, we planned to show effects of our 6-month home exercise program on pre-sarcopenia/sarcopenia status and overall physical function in community-dwelling elderly, &gt;=60 years old, with pre-sarcopenia or sarcopenia.\nSUBJECTS AND METHODS\nAlgorithm for the identification, selection and randomization of participants to the\nintervention and control groups.

The ILS study is a community-based research study involving 341 healthy individuals, &gt;=60 years old, living in Ina, Saitama Prefecture, Japan. Prospective participants from the ILS study were randomized to the exercise intervention group or control group, using a 2:1.5 allocation ratio (Fig. 1). The skeletal muscle mass index (SMI) was evaluated by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), and the cutoff values for sarcopenia based on the AWGS) criteria. Participants of presarcopenia in the intervention and control groups were screened to identify those with a SMI &lt;7.0 kg/m2 for men and &lt;5.7 kg/m2 for women. Sarcopenia were screened to identify those with a hand-grip strength &lt;26 kg for men and &lt;18 kg for women, add to criteria of presarcopenia. Of the 184 eligible participants in the intervention group, 34 were screened and provided consent. Of the 90 eligible participants in the control group, 18 were screened and providing consent. Ultimately, the intervention group was comprised of 29 (85.3%) with pre-sarcopenia and 5 (14.7%) with sarcopenia, and the control group 17 (94.4%) with pre-sarcopenia and 1 (5.6%) with sarcopenia. After baseline enrollment, 26 participants in the intervention group and 14 in the control group completed the post-intervention assessment (Fig. 1). Relevant descriptive variables of both groups were described in Table 1. The study was approved by the ethics board of the Faculty of Health and Medical Care of Saitama Medical University (No.113), and participants provided informed consent.\nThe home exercise programs included lower limb training (Locomotion-training)). The following lower limb resistance exercises and balance exercise were used: squats, single-leg standing and heel raises. Duration of the intervention was 6 months. In the intervention group, physical therapists provided a guidebook to participants, providing information on correct methods to perform the exercises.\nThe exercises were prescribed in the previous report as follows. For single-leg standing, participants were instructed to maintain a single-leg standing posture for one minute, using light touch on stable desk or chair. For squats, participants were instructed to move slowly from a standing posture to a half-sitting posture over a 6-second movement time, and then to slowly return to their standing position, with 6 repetitions performed per set. Heel raises were performed, with 20 repetitions per set. Participants were instructed to complete three full set of exercises per day. For the walking component of the program, participants were instructed to walk rhythmically, while keeping a correct posture of the head and trunk, for 20-30 minutes per day. Participants in the control group were instructed to maintain their usual daily activities and exercise for 6-months.\nData were collected at baseline and at the end of the 6-month intervention. Evaluation included assessment of body composition and physical function, a self-report survey of quality of life (QOL) and activity function. Body composition (Skeletal Muscle Index: SMI; Body Mass Index: BMI; Body fat percentage) was measured by Bio impedance analysis, using a multi-frequency body composition analyzer (MC-190, TANITA Co.). The following assessments of physical functions were performed: handgrip strength, duration of single-leg standing, comfortable and maximum walking speed, and knee extension strength. Knee extension strength was measured using a hand-held dynamometer (mu-TAS F-1; ANIMA Corporation). The measured force was changed to torque by multiplying the length of lower leg, and normalized by the body weight (Nm/kg)). Two self-report questionnaires were used, the Japanese version of the Euro QOL (EQ-5D)) and the 25-question Geriatric Locomotive Functional Scale (GLFS-25)), with participants completing the questionnaire independently. In addition, at baseline, participants were interviewed about their frequency of 'walking' and 'physical activities other than walking' performed. Participants were interviewed to evaluate their usual frequency of exercise by choosing from the following four options: 'no exercise', 'one day a week', 'two days a week', or 'three days a week or more'. For analysis, the frequency of exercise was dichotomized into two categories, &lt;2 days per week and &gt;=2 days per week.\nReviewing participants' daily training calendars assessed adherence to the exercise program for participants in the intervention group. The training volume completed for each exercise and the walking component of the program was calculated as the proportion of day's participants reported performing each component by the number of days of the intervention period.\nParticipants in both groups were re-evaluated on the AWGS criteria after the intervention.\nBaseline characteristics were compared between the intervention and control groups using independent t-test for continuous data and chi2 test for categorical data. Intervention effects were evaluated using the data from participants who completed both the baseline and 6-month assessments. Within-group change in body composition, physical function and questionnaire scores, between baseline and post-intervention, was evaluated using paired t-test, with repeated-measure two-way analysis of variance (two-way ANOVA) to evaluate interactions between measured variable, including calculation of the effect size (eta2). Between-group comparisons for all measured variables were evaluated at post-intervention using independent t-test. The proportion of change in sarcopenia and pre-sarcopenia status, from baseline to post-intervention, were evaluated using a chi-squared test. All statistical analyzes were performed using PASW Statistics (version 18; SPSS Japan Co.), with a p&lt;0.05 considered as the level of significance.\nRESULTS\nAt baseline, no significant difference was identified between groups (Table 1).\nThe proportion of 6-months of training completed for each exercise was as follows: 89.4% for squats, 92.0% for single-leg standing, 93.2% for heel-raise, and 71.7% for walking.\nChange in measured variables, from baseline to the 6-month assessment\n	Main effect	Interaction effect	 			 	Intervention group (n=26)	Control group (n=14)	Between effect	Interaction effect	Effect size (eta2)	 	BMI	Baseline	20.2 +- 1.8	19.9 +- 2.1			0.029	 	kg/m2	6 months	20.2 +- 2.1	19.6 +- 2.5				 		Time effect		*				 	SMI	Baseline	5.91 +- 0.66	6.02 +- 0.57			0.023	 	kg/m2	6 months	5.93 +- 0.65	5.95 +- 0.75				 		Time effect						 	%BF	Baseline	24.1 +- 6.3	21.9 +- 6.0			0.004	 	%	6 months	23.3 +- 7.1	20.7 +- 6.5				 		Time effect						 	HGS	Baseline	24.8 +- 7.4	28.6 +- 6.5			&lt;0.001	 	kg	6 months	26.1 +- 8.0	29.7 +- 7.8				 		Time effect	**					 	SLS	Baseline	60.5 +- 44.7	77.2 +- 41.5		*	0.132*	 	s	6 months	77.2 +- 45.5	61.6 +- 40.4				 		Time effect	*					 	WS (comfortable)	Baseline	1.48 +- 0.27	1.48 +- 0.26			0.012	 	m/sec	6 months	1.46 +- 0.20	1.42 +- 0.17				 		Time effect						 	WS (maximum)	Baseline	1.95 +- 0.30	2.02 +- 0.17		**	0.189**	 	m/sec	6 months	1.97 +- 0.24	1.86 +- 0.16				 		Time effect		**				 	KES	Baseline	1.38 +- 0.42	1.55 +- 0.35		*	0.128*	 	Nm/kg	6 months	1.69 +- 0.46	1.49 +- 0.80				 		Time effect	**					 	GLFS-25	Base line	2.7 +- 2.7	2.9 +- 1.6		**	0.139**	 		6 months	2.5 +- 3.0	5.1 +- 4.1	*			 		Time effect		*				 	EQ-5D	Baseline	0.909 +- 0.128	0.918 +- 0.114			0.021	 		6 months	0.945 +- 0.100	0.917 +- 0.117				 		Time effect						 	\nData are presented mean and standard deviation. *p&lt;0.05; **p&lt;0.01.

A significant improvement in handgrip strength (24.8 kg to 26.1 kg), single-leg standing (60.5s to 77.2s) and knee extension strength (1.38 Nm/kg to 1.69 Nm/kg) was identified in the intervention group. A significant decrease in BMI (19.9 kg/m2 to 19.6 kg/m2) and maximum walking speed (2.02 m/s to 1.86m/s), with a concomitant increase in GLFS-25 scores (2.9 to 5.1) were identified in the control group. The GLFS-25 scores were significantly higher for the control group at 6-months than for the intervention group. Two-way ANOVA identified a significant interaction between single-leg standing and knee extension strength, with a significant improvement identified for the intervention group. A significant interaction was also identified between maximum walking speed and the GLFS-25 score. In the control group, maximum walking speed and GLFS-25 scores decreased significantly, from baseline to 6-months. The effect size (eta2) of the intervention program was calculated for outcome variables that significantly improved from baseline to post-intervention: duration of single-leg standing, 0.132; maximum walking speed, 0.189; knee extension strength, 0.128; and GLFS-25 score, 0.139.\nChange in sarcopenia and pre-sarcopenia status\n	Normal	Pre-sarcopenia	Sarcopenia	 				 	Baseline*	6-month 	Baseline*	6-month 	Baseline*	6-month 	 	Intervention group (n=26)	0	4 (15.4)	21 (80.8)	20 (76.9)	5 (19.2)	2 (7.7)	 	Control group (n=14)	0	2 (14.3)	13 (92.9)	11 (78.6)	1 (7.1)	1 (7.1)	 	\n*p=0.399,  p=0.993.

Among the 26 participants in the intervention group, a normal status was identified for 4 participants (15.4%). Among the 14 participants in the control group, a normal status was identified in 2 participants (14.3%). No aggravation to sarcopenia was identified in either group over the duration of the study. In the intervention group, 3 of the 5 participants with sarcopenia improved to a pre-sarcopenia status. There was no change in status at 6-months for the 1 participant with sarcopenia in the control group.\nDISCUSSION\nWe evaluated the effectiveness of a 6-month home exercise program, combining walking and lower limb resistance exercises, among community-dwelling individuals, &gt;=60 years old, with sarcopenia and pre-sarcopenia. Adherence to the program of exercise was high, with completion of 70-90% of the total training volume. All components of the program were 'easy to perform' and did not require any special facility or equipment. Importantly, the selected exercises could be easily incorporated into participants' daily routine, with 1-2 minutes required to perform one set of the exercises, and the walking program maintained at a reasonable duration of 20-30 minutes. Despite the convenience of our program, 23.5% of participants in the intervention group (8 out of 34 participants) dropped-out of the study. Furthermore, 16 participants (8%) of the intervention group could not be contacted for baseline evaluation, because the schedule was not matched with theirs. Adherence might increase during the actual intervention, rather than the survey, although the reason for discontinuing the intervention could not be clarified in this study. However, Pisters reported that adherence was associated with pain, physical function, and self-perceived effect). Thus, future effort is needed to improve adherence.\nOur findings of significant improvement in handgrip strength, single-leg standing and knee extension strength indicated that a 'relatively simple' program of exercise is sufficient to improve muscle strength in middle-aged and elderly individuals with low SMI. A medium-to-large effect size) (eta2) of the program was identified for single-leg standing (0.132) and knee extension strength (0.128). Our program was effective in improving physical function in participants with pre-sarcopenia/sarcopenia, and in changing the status from sarcopenia to pre-sarcopenia in 3 of the 5 participants diagnosed with sarcopenia in the intervention group at baseline. Moreover, several participants with pre-sarcopenia changed to a normal status in both groups over the duration of the study. However, the exercise intervention did not produce a significant effect on the SMI. Based on these results, the gains in strength were likely obtained by facilitation of motor units rather than an increase in muscle mass. An increase in muscle mass requires an increase in the size of muscle fibers by activated satellite cells. Depending on exercise load, a program may preferentially facilitate the neural or structural pathways for muscle strength gains, with strength gains related to an increase in muscle mass requiring a longer time line for development. Future research on home exercise programs in elderly individuals with sarcopenia will need to examine the effects of loading on the neural and structural components of muscle strengthening.\nOver the study period, BMI and maximum walking speed decreased for the control group, while the GLFS-25 score increased. Miyahara et al.) previously identified maximum walking speed, BMI and medical history, as well as employment status, as being significant factors associated with daily functioning of community-dwelling elderly individuals. Watanabe et al.) also reported that a decrease in walking speed and muscle mass were independent predictors of deteriorating physical function and activities. In our study group, we provide evidence of a natural decrease in physical and activity function over a 6-month period in individuals over 60 years of age with pre-sarcopenia or sarcopenia. This natural decline in muscle mass was associated with a decrease in maximum walking speed over the same 6-month period and a self-reported decrease in physical function. Therefore, our longitudinal data supported findings of previously published cross-sectional studies.\nAn important outcome of our study is the finding that regular performance of an 'easy to perform' home exercise program is effective in improving physical function in community-dwelling elderly people &gt;=60 years old with pre-sarcopenia or sarcopenia.\nIn the interpretation of our findings for practice, it is important to note that participants in our study were healthy individuals who voluntarily participated in our program of exercise. In addition, home exercise program could not standardized load in each participant.\nA 6-month home exercise program, combining walking and resistance lower limb exercises, was effective in improving maximum walking speed and muscle strength in individuals, &gt;=60 years old with pre-sarcopenia or sarcopenia. Our program was effective in preventing an overall decline in physical function, although load of training were not sufficient to improve muscle mass.\nREFERENCES\nSarcopenia: European consensus on

Introduction\nFrailty is underpinned by a progressive loss of muscle mass and strength, particularly from the lower limbs, and is associated with increased risk of falls and reduced quality of life. There is a minimum threshold of strength required to complete tasks of daily living independently, and finding means to delay individuals reaching this &quot;frailty threshold&quot; has been identified as an urgent health care priority. With muscle mass lost at 0.5-1% per year after 50 years of age and strength lost even more rapidly, modest improvements of a few percent in muscle size and strength from a training programme may, in essence, represent postponement of frailty measurable in years. Crucially, intervention is needed before older adults' functional capacity declines past the point that exercise is no longer a safe means to maintain muscle strength.\nProgressive resistance exercise training improves muscle strength in older adults, and it is accompanied by multifaceted improvements in health and function. Traditionally, heavy load resistance training has been regarded as the most effective strategy to increase muscle strength, due to associated neural and hypertrophic adaptations. Recent evidence suggests that low-load resistance training can also be efficacious in increasing muscle strength, particularly in an untrained population, albeit to a lesser degree in comparison to high-load resistance training. Training with low loads and low overall session volume may allow for increased training frequency, as recovery times may be shorter between sessions. Dankel et al. suggests that manipulation of training frequency to maintain overall training volume with more sessions of lower load across a week may even increase hypertrophic training responses. Although this has not yet been borne out empirically, it is intuitively appealing to reason that a reduced training session load with short recovery times may suit an older population previously doing no formal exercise because it may overcome some of the barriers to starting an exercise programme.\nShort bouts of exercise spread across the day, termed &quot;exercise snacks,&quot; have received attention as a time-efficient exercise strategy. Francois et al. identified that exercise snacking before each meal, consisting of six discrete minutes of exercise separated by one minute of rest, improved glycaemic control the following day in middle-aged adults with impaired glucose handling. Jenkins et al. reported improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness in healthy inactive adults performing three sets of maximum effort 60-step stair climbs a day, three times a week, for six weeks. The improvement in exercise tolerance included an increase in maximum power output during a VO2 peak test on a cycle ergometer. This suggests that an exercise snacking model may have the potential to improve function beyond just cardiovascular fitness. As such, exercise snacking was examined in the present pilot study with the aim of providing a stimulus to improve leg strength in older adults that could be undertaken in the home on a daily basis without the need for supervision.\nThe primary aim of the present pilot study was to investigate the effects of four weeks of twice daily &quot;exercise snacking&quot; on maximum number of sit-to-stands from a chair performed in one minute, compared with a control group maintaining their habitual physical activity patterns. The secondary aims were to assess adherence to the exercise snacking intervention, along with the effects on force, velocity, and power, during leg press dynamometry and on whole-body and lower limb anthropometry. The proposed intervention was specifically designed to be suitable to perform in the home environment, without the need for supervision or specific exercise equipment. The overall objective of this pilot study was to inform future work on exercise strategies extending to populations with lifestyle-compromising age-related loss of muscle strength or mass.\n2. Materials and Methods\nA two-group experimental research design was used in this pilot study to examine the effects of twice daily &quot;exercise snacking&quot; on muscle function and size in healthy, community-dwelling older adults. For 28 days, one group undertook a home-based exercise snacking intervention (ES) and the other group acted as a nonexercising control by maintaining habitual physical activity levels. As a control variable, both groups were provided with 150 g of yogurt to consume as part of their breakfast meal for the 28 days, to both act as a &quot;positive control&quot; to reduce participant dropout from the Control group and to achieve optimal dietary protein intake. All participants completed two familiarisation sessions to functional measures used in the pre- and postintervention assessment, separated by at least seven days, with the second session completed at least five days before the preintervention assessments. Function testing and imaging measures were completed on the day before and the day after the 28-day intervention. Between familiarisation sessions and during the last week of the intervention, physical activity and diet were assessed. See Figure 1 for a schematic overview of the pilot study timeline.\n2.1. Participants\nTwenty healthy, community-dwelling, older men and women (65-80 years), not undertaking regular structured exercise, were recruited for the pilot study through local newspaper advertisement and social media. Individuals who were nonsmokers, had BMI of  &gt;=20 &lt; 30 kg/m2, had no contraindications to exercise or recent history of musculoskeletal injury, and had scored 8 or above with no score of zero on any test of the SPPB at the initial screening were invited to take part in the pilot study. Participants were assigned to groups by way of minimisation to limit differences in mean age, BMI, and 60-second sit-to-stand (STS) score at the screening visit, on account of the small sample size. An individual outside of the study team performed participant group allocation. Participant characteristics recorded during screening are presented in Table 1. All participants provided written informed consent. The protocol was approved by the National Health Service (NHS) South West:Frenchay Research Ethics Committee (Ref: 16/SW/0300) and registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT02991989).\n3. Measures\n3.1. Imaging\nParticipants arrived at the laboratory for trial days following a 10-hour overnight fast, having drunk 1 pint of water, and having not undertaken exhaustive exercise in the previous 24 hours. Participants were asked to void before weight was measured with electronic scales (BC543, Tanita, Amsterdam, Netherlands). Whole-body composition, whole-body lean mass, and leg lean mass were estimated using a DXA system (QDR software version 12.4.2, Hologic Discovery W, Bedford, MA) by differentiating the fat, bone, and lean (nonbone nonfat) masses. A spine phantom was used for the quality control scan performed at the start of every trial day before participant testing, as per the manufacturer's guidelines. Participants wore the same light clothes for pre- and postintervention trials and removed all metal items. The investigator positioned the participant to be laying supine on the scanning bed such that body regions could be partitioned upon analysis. Manual placement of boundaries between discrete anatomical regions was conducted for all scans by the same investigator (OJP), before analysis using manufacturer's software.\nLower limb (calf and thigh) muscle cross-sectional area (mCSA) was assessed by peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT; XCT3000, StraTec Medizintechnik GmbH, Pforzheim, Germany). During the preintervention trial, tibia (medial knee joint line to medial malleolus) and femur length (greater trochanter to lateral knee joint line) of the dominant leg were measured using a fabric tape measure whilst participants were standing. Scans were performed with the participant laying supine on a bed with leg placed through the scanning gantry and foot strapped into a footplate. Scout scans were performed at the distal ends of the tibia and femur to locate the end of bones, respectively. Single 2D slice scans were performed at 66% of the tibia length proximally from the medial malleolus, and 25% of the femur length proximally to the lateral femoral epicondyle, based on the bone lengths previously recorded. Scan images were analysed using the BoneJ plugin (Version 1.4.2) for ImageJ (1.44p, Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health, USA). Following scanning measures, participants were provided with a breakfast of their choice, which was matched on the postintervention trial day.\n3.2. Functional Measures\nA maximum number of repeated STS in 60 seconds were performed from a chair with a seat height of 44 cm, with arms folded across the chest and reaching full hip and knee extension on standing. During familiarisation, a researcher counted the number of repetitions aloud, with a timing clock in view of the participant. On trial days, participants were not in view of a clock and repetitions were not counted aloud, with participants instructed to complete repetitions at the fastest rate they could manage until told to stop. Immediately on completion of the STS, a rating of perceived exertion (RPE) was assessed using Borg's RPE 15-grade scale.\nMaximum leg pressing velocity, force, and power characteristics were measured on a seated pneumatic leg press dynamometer (A420, Keiser , Fresno, CA). Data collection, processing, and analysis were performed as described previously. Briefly, during familiarisation sessions, participants completed tests of one-repetition maximum (1-RM) leg pressing force against self-selected increments in resistance. No emphasis was placed on contraction velocity for the 1-RM test, and participants were instructed to reach 1-RM within 15 repetitions with self-selected interrepetition rest. Participants then performed a series of approximately 10 discrete repetitions, each performed at maximum concentric contraction velocity against an incrementally increasing pedal resistance, up to a resistance equalling the previously achieved 1-RM. On trial days, a set warm-up was performed based on the 1-RM achieved in the second familiarisation, consisting of 5 x 30%-1RM, 5 x 50%-1RM, 2 x 70%-1RM, and 1 x 80%-1RM, followed by five minutes of seated rest. The aforementioned incremental test was then performed, with the tenth repetition at a resistance equal to the 1-RM achieved in the second familiarisation. To extrapolate theoretical maximum contraction velocity (Vmax) and force (Fmax), linear regression of force and velocity at which peak power of each repetition occurred was calculated. Interpolated peak power (Pmax) was determined by numerical differentiation of the second-order polynomial calculated from the force-power profile, i.e., from peak power and the force at the instant of peak power for each repetition.\n3.3. Physical Activity\nFree-living physical activity was assessed on seven consecutive days by continuous wear of an armband mounted physical activity monitor (SenseWear, BodyMedia, Inc., Pittsburg, PA, USA). This was undertaken between the familiarisation sessions before the intervention period as a baseline measure and during the last week of the intervention period. Physical activity level (PAL) was calculated as estimated mean daily energy expenditure/resting metabolic rate (estimated using the World Health Organisation equation). Only days with &gt;95% wear time achieved were included in the analysis. Participants were instructed to remove the armband for water-based activity, such as bathing or showering, and any water-based activities were recorded in the logbook.\n3.4. Diet Records\nThree-day weighed diet records (two weekdays and one weekend) were completed by participants. Again, this was undertaken between familiarisation sessions and during the last week of the intervention period. Commercially available online software (v4.312 Nutritics Education, Dublin, Ireland) was used for diet record analysis, all of which was performed by the same researcher (OJP). Mean daily intake of total kcal, carbohydrate (CHO), protein (PRO), and fat were obtained and calculated relative to body mass using screening body mass and postintervention body mass for baseline and intervention dietary records, respectively. Between pre- and postintervention trials, participants consumed 150 g of yogurt (Natural flavour, Skyr, Arla ; 98 kcal, 0.3 g fat, 6 g carbohydrate, 16.5 g protein) as part of their breakfast meal. Participants were provided with food weighing scales and a logbook to record whether the full 150 g of yogurt had been consumed each day and deliberately not given any further instruction concerning dietary intake.\n3.5. Intervention\nThe Control group was asked to continue with their habitual physical activities for 28 days. The exercise snacking group was asked to perform two bouts of &quot;exercise snacking&quot; per day, once in the morning and once in the evening. Exercise snacking bouts consisted of five exercises, each undertaken for one minute with the aim to complete as many repetitions as possible in that minute. Between each exercise, participants rested for one minute. The exercises were STS from a chair, seated knee extensions of alternating legs, standing knee bends of alternating legs, marching on the spot, and standing calf raises (see Supplemental Figures -, respectively). Participants were advised to hold onto a chair for stability during standing exercise if they felt the need to. The STS exercise was performed first, with the number of repetitions completed recorded in a provided logbook as a means to assess adherence. Any adverse events during the intervention period for either group were to be recorded in a logbook, regardless of whether they were related to the intervention.\n3.6. Statistical Analysis\nShapiro-Wilks tests of normality were performed on participant characteristic data recorded at screening (age, body mass, BMI, and STS score) due to the small sample size. Participant characteristic variables were normally distributed, thus compared with independent-samples t-test. Outcome variables were analysed with a two-way repeated measures ANOVA, and where there was a significant interaction or time effect was observed, a Holm-Bonferroni post hoc test performed. Statistical significance was accepted at p &lt; 0.05. To infer the magnitude of differences between the groups, Hedges g effect size for difference in change scores between the groups was calculated, to account for low sample size. Effect sizes were classed as small (0.2), moderate (0.5), and large (0.8) according to Cohen. Data are presented as mean (standard deviation); ANOVA and post hoc analysis were performed using SPSS v22.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL), and effect size analysis was performed using Microsoft  Excel  2016.\n4. Results\n4.1. Functional Measures\nAdherence to the ES intervention was 98% (2 (1) sessions out of 56 sessions missed), and no adverse events occurred during the intervention period in either group. Pre- to postintervention STS scores were significantly increased (p &lt; 0.01) in the ES group (29 (8) to 38 (13)), compared with the Control group (29 (14) to 29 (13)). There was a large between-group effect size of g = 1.40 for the difference in STS change scores (Figure 2). There was no significant change in RPE for the STS pre- and postintervention in either group (Control: 13 (3) to 14 (2); ES: 13 (2) to 14 (2)). There were no significant time or interaction effects for Vmax, Fmax, or Pmax (Table 2). Effect sizes for change scores between the groups were moderate for Vmax and Fmax (g = 0.62 and g = 0.49, respectively) and large for Pmax (g = 0.81).\n4.2. Anthropometry\nOne participant from the Control group was removed from DXA analysis due to movement artefact on one scan. As shown in Table 3, there were no significant changes in body mass, or DXA measured % body fat, total lean mass, or lean leg mass in either group, but a moderate effect size for the difference in leg lean mass change scores (g = 0.68).\nOne participant from the ES group was removed from the calf pQCT scan analysis, and one participant from the Control group was removed from the thigh pQCT scan analysis, both due to movement artefact. Calf mCSA did not change significantly for either group, with an effect size for difference in the change scores between the groups being g = 0.10. There were no statistically significant changes in thigh mCSA in either group, although there was a large effect size for the difference in change scores between the groups (g = 0.96) with an increase of 2% in the ES group (see Figure 3).\n4.3. Physical Activity and Diet\nThere were no changes in PAL in either group from baseline assessment to the last week of the intervention, nor were there changes in total energy (kcal/kg/day) or carbohydrate intake (g/kg/day). There were significant time effects for an increase in daily protein intake (p &lt; 0.01) and decrease in daily fat intake (p &lt; 0.05). Because there were no differences between the groups, the effect size for the pooled change score (pre- to postintervention for all participants) were moderate for dietary protein and fat intake (g = 0.71 and g = 0.60, respectively) (see Table 4).\n5. Discussion and Implications\nThe impact of undertaking 28 days of twice daily home-based exercise snacking, supplemented with 150 g of yogurt at breakfast, on lower limb muscle function and anthropometry was explored in healthy older adults. Adherence to the exercise regime was very high (98%), and participants in the ES group showed marked improvements in the number of sit-to-stands performed in 60 seconds, with no improvement in the Control group. Large effect sizes were also observed in the change scores for interpolated maximum leg pressing power and thigh muscle cross-sectional area, albeit the absolute increases in these variable appear modest.\nThe exercise snacking regime consisted of five leg exercises; each completed twice a day across two bouts, with the aim to complete as many repetitions of each exercise as possible in a minute with no external load above body weight. This mode of exercise deviates from successful home-based exercise programmes explored previously; primarily, in that, all exercise was nonloaded, participants undertook exercise twice a day, there were no supervised exercise sessions in the home, and the programme lasted only four weeks. The ES group showed significantly improved STS score, with the 31% improvement in the STS in 60 seconds in the present pilot study being remarkably similar to the 30% improvement in 30-second STS score observed after six weeks of resistance training in older adults by Cavani et al.. With 60-second STS being one of the exercises completed twice daily for the ES group, this was not unexpected, even though the conditions between exercise bouts and testing sessions were deliberately different (self-timed vs. no information of time remaining in the test). Although the improvement in STS is likely largely due to task-specific training, the movement pattern is nonetheless relevant for tasks of daily living. Given that the mode of training applied no external load beyond body weight and did not require participants to exercise to momentary failure, improvements in leg press Vmax and Fmax of 3% and 5%, respectively, along with a trend toward significant increases in Pmax (6% increase; p=0.09) were perhaps not expected and provide an indication of the potential efficacy of this type of &quot;little and often&quot; intervention.\nAs a point of comparison, in the study by Bean et al., older adults trained three times a week for 12 weeks, completing three sets of 10 repetitions of maximum concentric contraction speed exercises similar to those of the present pilot study, whilst wearing a weighted vest. The weighted vest group increased maximum leg press power by 12%, also assessed with pneumatic leg press dynamometry. Although the present pilot study employed an intervention only one-third of the programme duration as the aforementioned study, and without external loading, a 6% increase in Pmax was observed. Whether functional improvements of the exercise snacking regime over longer training durations would continue to increase with the only element of progression being completion of more repetitions in a minute cannot be known. It should be noted that although the participants in the present pilot study were previously undertaking no regular structured exercise, they were healthy and not functionally impaired, so were perhaps more physiologically receptive to the training stimulus provided than a frail or clinical population might be. Nonetheless, increases in Fmax and Pmax of 5% and 6%, respectively, represent changes with real-world relevance given the estimated annual loss of muscle strength of 1-5% described by Seene and Kaasik, particularly as the strength and power gains were achieved in four weeks with a zero-cost exercise intervention. However, whether these task-specific increases in strength and power lead to clinically relevant improvements in outcomes, such as delaying dynapenia/sarcopenia or frailty, would require further investigation and long-term follow-up.\nThere were some small but noteworthy changes in anthropometric measures of the legs following the ES intervention. In particular, leg lean mass measured by DXA increased by 1% (g = 0.68) and thigh mCSA increased by 2% with a large effect size (g = 0.98). In comparison to an effect size of 0.39 (0.17) (95% CI: 0.05, 0.73) for hypertrophy induced by low-load resistance exercise training calculated in a recent meta-analysis by Schoenfeld et al., the potential increase in muscle size observed in present pilot is notable. No mechanisms for an increase in muscle size were examined in this work, but it could be in part due to the comparatively high frequency of training, although this of course can only be speculated due to the scarcity of studies using twice daily exercise programmes. It is also possible that any hypertrophy observed in the present pilot study was in part due to the additional protein ingested at breakfast via the yogurt supplement. This notion would be supported by the evidence of Mamerow et al., albeit in a younger population, that 24-hour muscle protein synthesis rate was greater with an even distribution of protein throughout the day compared with a more traditional, evening heavy, protein distribution. Although it is encouraging that two independent measurement techniques concomitantly suggest that a short-term exercise snacking intervention may have potential to increase leg muscle size, the absolute changes were small, and exercise-induced oedema from the previous day's exercise cannot be ruled out as a potential confounder in this instance. However, this seems unlikely given the nature of the exercise snacking bouts, the fact that participants would have been accustomed to the exercise after 28 days, and that the increase in mCSA was not observed in the calf muscle group that was also measured by pQCT.\nBoth groups modestly increased daily protein intake per kilogram of body mass by 17% and 19% during the intervention (Control and ES, respectively), going from 1.05 (0.20) g/kg/day to 1.24 (0.32) g/kg/day (pooled mean). Although the older adults in the present pilot study were previously consuming over-the-recommended daily allowance (RDA) of protein, Phillips et al. present convincing rationale that the RDA may not represent an optimal daily protein intake for older adults in particular. The suggested range of 1.2 to 1.6 g/kg/day as a more appropriate daily protein intake was achieved in the present pilot study with the addition of 16.5 g of dairy protein at breakfast. However, further inspection of the absolute change in dietary protein consumption highlighted that total protein intake increased by  10 g/day. There was not an increase in daily protein intake equal to the amount contained in the yogurt possibly because protein that would have been included in the breakfast meal may have been replaced with the yogurt. This is potentially important on a per meal basis, as larger protein doses are required to maximally stimulate muscle protein synthesis in older adults. Moreover, this potentially serves to highlight the challenges with supplementing older adult diets with additional protein. In any case, whether an extra 10 g/d protein intake would lead to clinically relevant outcomes in an older population is questionable. The lack of increase in strength or hypertrophy in the Control group support the work of Kim et al., finding that even adjusting protein distribution for 8 weeks without the addition of exercise does not increase muscle mass or strength in older adults. Importantly, this was despite achieving over 1.2 g/kg/day of protein, highlighting the importance of a combination of exercise and nutrition to address muscle loss with ageing However, the duration of the intervention in the present pilot study was very short, and the use of only three-day diet records are often criticised for a bias toward under reporting. Consequently, these data should not be seen to undermine the potential health and body composition benefits of a longer-term increase in dietary protein intake for older adults not meeting recommended quantities of dietary protein intake.\nThere are a number of crucial considerations when contextualising the present findings. Most obviously, the pilot study design employed cannot support the efficacy of exercise snacking without dietary protein supplementation. The addition of two further groups (a true nonexercising control group and an exercise snacking without yogurt group) would shed light on the importance of the additional protein at breakfast, but it would require a large increase in sample size. Moreover, based on the effect size of the present pilot study data, power calculations (G*power, Version 3.1.9.4) indicated that for statistically significant differences in Pmax (alpha=0.05 and power = 0.8), 27 participants per group would have been required using the current research design. Equally, group sizes of 19 would have been required for statistically significant differences in thigh mCSA. By increasing sample size, a traditional randomisation strategy to allocate participants to study groups could have been appropriate, whereas due to a small sample size, minimisation was implemented as means to reduce chance difference in baseline characteristics of groups in this present pilot study. Although the adherence to the exercise programme was very high, it cannot be assumed that this would persist longer than four weeks or in other older populations. Investigation of physiological mechanisms to support the strength and hypertrophic gains observed in the present findings may also allow for further optimisation of the exercise regime itself, creating a potentially more efficacious training stimulus. In the same vein, a longer-term follow-up would also be required to establish whether the physiological adaptions might continue to occur if the exercise stimulus were to be maintained. It should of course not be overlooked that high-load resistance training has superior effects on increasing muscle mass and strength, potentially through more pronounced neural adaptations, and more easily accommodates progressive overload to facilitate continuous improvements in muscle mass and strength. However, accepting that access and cost of exercise participation and lack of knowledge of exercise modalities are often key barriers to exercise in older adults, very simple home-based exercise snacking-style regimes are a promising strategy to engage older adults in exercise.\n6. Conclusions\nIn conclusion, although underpowered to show statistically significant changes, the present study highlights the potential efficacy of a 28-day, home-based &quot;little and often&quot; exercise snacking programme, for improving leg power and muscle size in healthy older adults. Along with marked task-specific improvements in sit-to-stand score, indications that maximum leg press force and power may also improve modestly with exercise snacking demonstrate transferability of the training. Whether these changes represent potentially clinically relevant improvements in function requires further investigation. Although more research is certainly needed to explain the mechanisms by which such a short-term exercise snacking regime may improve muscle strength and size, understanding the real-world acceptability of this exercise strategy could help provide easy-to-act-upon recommendations for older adults to maintain function into later life.\nData Availability\nAll data supporting this study are openly available from the University of Bath data archive at https://doi.org/10.15125/BATH-00701\nConflicts of Interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.\nSupplementary Materials\nAge-related changes in the structure and function of skeletal muscles\nSarcopenia: causes, consequences, and preventions\nFrailty and sarcopenia: definitions and outcome parameters\nSarcopenia, dynapenia and the impact of advancing age on human skeletal muscle size and strength; a quantitative review\nLongitudinal study of muscle strength, quality, and adipose tissue infiltration\nProgressive resistance strength training for improving physical function in older adults\nStrength training improves muscle aerobic capacity and glucose tolerance in elderly\nEffects of resistance training frequency on measures of muscle hypertrophy: a systematic review and meta-analysis\nThe adaptations to strength training\nNeither load nor systemic hormones determine resistance training-mediated hypertrophy or strength gains in resistance-trained young men\nMuscular adaptations in low- versus high-load resistance training: a meta-analysis\nDoes training to failure maximize muscle hypertrophy?\nFrequency: the overlooked resistance training variable for inducing muscle hypertrophy?\nMotivators and barriers to exercise in an older community-dwelling population\n&quot;Exercise snacks&quot; before meals: a novel strategy to improve glycaemic control in individuals with insulin resistance\nDo stair climbing exercise &quot;snacks&quot; improve cardiorespiratory fitness?\nProtein &quot;requirements&quot; beyond the RDA: implications for optimizing health\nA short physical performance battery assessing lower extremity function: association with self-reported disability and prediction of mortality and nursing home admission\nTreatment allocation by minimisation\nThe method of minimization for allocation to clinical trials\nDifferential effects of exercise on tibial shaft marrow density in young female athletes\nBoneJ: free and extensible bone image analysis in ImageJ\nA pilot study of perceived exertion and physical working capacity\nHabitual physical activity levels do not predict leg strength and power in healthy, active older adults\nOptimal force-velocity profile in ballistic movements-altius\nEstimation of effect size from a series of independent experiments\nHome-based resistance training for older adults: a systematic review\nEffects of a 6-week resistance-training program on functional fitness of older adults\nMuscle strength and rising from a chair in older adults\nIncreased velocity exercise specific to task (InVEST) training: a pilot study exploring effects on leg power, balance, and mobility in community-dwelling older women\nA program to prevent functional decline in physically frail, elderly persons who live at home\nMuscle weakness in the elderly: role of sarcopenia, dynapenia, and possibilities for rehabilitation\nDietary protein distribution positively influences 24-h muscle protein synthesis in healthy adults\nEarly resistance training-induced increases in muscle cross-sectional area are concomitant with edema-induced muscle swelling\nAn examination of the time course of training-induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy\nProtein intake distribution pattern does not affect anabolic response, lean body mass, muscle strength or function over 8 weeks in older adults: a randomized-controlled trial\nAssessing dietary intake: who, what and why of under-reporting\nThe effects of high protein diets on thermogenesis, satiety and weight loss: a critical review\nAdherence to exercise programs for older people is influenced by program characteristics and personal factors: a systematic review\nStrength training at high versus low external resistance in older adults: effects on muscle volume, muscle strength, and force-velocity characteristics\nGreater neural adaptations following high- vs. low-load resistance training\nMotives for and barriers to physical activity among older adults with mobility limitations\nA schematic overview of the pilot study timeline.\nIndividual changes in sit-to-stand score from pre- to postintervention of either 28 days of yogurt at breakfast only (Control) or yogurt at breakfast and exercise snacking twice daily (ES).

activity is considered crucial in attenuating losses in strength and power associated with ageing.\n However, in well-functioning, active older adults the relationship between habitual physical activity and muscle function is surprisingly unclear.\n Leg press velocity, force, and power, were compared between 50 older and 30 younger healthy individuals, and associations with habitual physical activity explored.\n An incremental power test was performed on a pneumatic leg press, with theoretical maximum velocity, force, and power calculated.\n Vastus lateralis muscle thickness was measured by ultrasound, and participants wore a combined accelerometer and heart rate monitor for 6-days of free-living.\n Older individuals produced lower absolute maximum velocity, force, and power, than younger individuals.\n When accounting for smaller muscle size, older individuals maximum force and power remained markedly lower.\n Both groups were active, however using age specific thresholds for classifying physical activity, the older individuals engaged in twice the amount of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity in comparison to the younger individuals.\n There were no associations between any characteristics of muscle function and physical activity.\n These data support that the ability to generate force and power deteriorates with age, however habitual physical activity levels

Positively Influences 24-h Muscle Protein Synthesis in Healthy Adults<","abstract":"The RDA for protein describes the quantity that should be consumed daily to meet population needs and to prevent deficiency.\n Protein consumption in many countries exceeds the RDA; however, intake is often skewed toward the evening meal, whereas breakfast is typically carbohydrate rich and low in protein.\n We examined the effects of protein distribution on 24-h skeletal muscle protein synthesis in healthy adult men and women (n = 8; age: 36.9  3.1 y; BMI: 25.7  0.8 kg/m2).\n By using a 7-d crossover feeding design with a 30-d washout period, we measured changes in muscle protein synthesis in response to isoenergetic and isonitrogenous diets with protein at breakfast, lunch, and dinner distributed evenly (EVEN; 31.5  1.3, 29.9  1.6, and 32.7  1.6 g protein, respectively) or skewed (SKEW; 10.7  0.8, 16.0  0.5, and 63.4  3.7 g protein, respectively).\n Over 24-h periods on days 1 and 7, venous blood samples and vastus lateralis muscle biopsy samples were obtained during primed (2.0 ?mol/kg) constant infusion [0.06 ?mol/(kg?min)] of l-[ring-13C6]phenylalanine.\n The 24-h mixed muscle protein fractional synthesis rate was 25% higher in the EVEN (0.075  0.006%/h) vs.\n the SKEW (0.056  0.006%/h) protein distribution groups (P = 0.003).\n This pattern was maintained after 7 d of habituation to each diet (EVEN vs.\n SKEW: 0.077  0.006 vs.\n 0.056  0.006%/h; P = 0.001).\n The consumption of a moderate amount of protein at each meal stimulated 24-h muscle protein synthesis more effectively than skewing protein intake toward the evening meal.\n","id":"PMC4018950","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"American Society for Nutrition","authors":[{"firstname":"Madonna

Synthesis More Than High-Load Low Volume Resistance Exercise in Young Men","abstract":"Background\nWe aimed to determine the effect of resistance exercise intensity (% 1 repetition maximum1RM) and volume on muscle protein synthesis, anabolic signaling, and myogenic gene expression.\n\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nFifteen men (211 years; BMI?=?24.10.8 kg/m2) performed 4 sets of unilateral leg extension exercise at different exercise loads and/or volumes: 90% of repetition maximum (1RM) until volitional failure (90FAIL), 30% 1RM work-matched to 90%FAIL (30WM), or 30% 1RM performed until volitional failure (30FAIL).\n\n Infusion of [ring-13C6] phenylalanine with biopsies was used to measure rates of mixed (MIX), myofibrillar (MYO), and sarcoplasmic (SARC) protein synthesis at rest, and 4 h and 24 h after exercise.\n\n Exercise at 30WM induced a significant increase above rest in MIX (121%) and MYO (87%) protein synthesis at 4 h post-exercise and but at 24 h in the MIX only.\n\n The increase in the rate of protein synthesis in MIX and MYO at 4 h post-exercise with 90FAIL and 30FAIL was greater than 30WM, with no difference between these conditions; however, MYO remained elevated (199%) above rest at 24 h only in 30FAIL.\n\n There was a significant increase in AktSer473 at 24h in all conditions (P?=?0.023) and mTORSer2448 phosphorylation at 4 h post-exercise (P?=?0.025).\n\n Phosporylation of Erk1/2Tyr202/204, p70S6KThr389, and 4E-BP1Thr37/46 increased significantly (P&lt;0.05) only in the 30FAIL condition at 4 h post-exercise, whereas, 4E-BP1Thr37/46 phosphorylation was greater 24 h after exercise than at rest in both 90FAIL (237%) and 30FAIL (312%) conditions.\n\n Pax7 mRNA expression increased at 24 h post-exercise (P?=?0.02) regardless of condition.\n\n The mRNA expression of MyoD and myogenin were consistently elevated in the 30FAIL condition.\n\n\nConclusions/Significance\nThese results suggest that low-load high volume resistance exercise is more effective in inducing acute muscle anabolism than high-load low volume or work matched resistance exercise modes.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2918506","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Nicholas

glycogen content","abstract":"Background\nUltrasound imaging is a valuable tool in exercise and sport science research, and has been used to visualize and track real-time movement of muscles and tendons, estimate hydration status in body tissues, and most recently, quantify skeletal muscle glycogen content.\n\n In this validation study, direct glycogen quantification from pre-and post-exercise muscle biopsy samples was compared with glycogen content estimates made through a portable, diagnostic high-frequency ultrasound and cloud-based software system (MuscleSound, Denver, CO).\n\n\nMethods\nWell-trained cyclists (N?=?20, age 38.4??6.0 y, 351??57.6 wattsmax) participated in a 75-km cycling time trial on their own bicycles using CompuTrainer Pro Model 8001 trainers (RacerMate, Seattle, WA).\n\n Muscle biopsy samples and ultrasound measurements were acquired pre- and post-exercise.\n\n Specific locations on the vastus lateralis were marked, and a trained technician used a 12MHz linear transducer and a standard diagnostic high resolution GE LOGIQ-e ultrasound machine (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI) to make three ultrasound measurements.\n\n Ultrasound images were pre-processed to isolate the muscle area under analysis, with the mean pixel intensity averaged from the three scans and scaled (0 to 100 scale) to create the glycogen score.\n\n Pre- and post-exercise muscle biopsy samples were acquired at the vastus lateralis location (2cm apart) using the suction-modified percutaneous needle biopsy procedure, and analyzed for glycogen content.\n\n\nResults\nThe 20 cyclists completed the 75-km cycling time trial in 168??26.0minutes at a power output of 193??57.8 watts (54.2??9.6% wattsmax).\n\n Muscle glycogen decreased 77.2??17.4%, with an absolute change of 71.4??23.1mmol glycogen per kilogram of muscle.\n\n The MuscleSound change score at the vastus lateralis site correlated highly with change in measured muscle glycogen content (R?=?0.92, P?&lt;?0.001).\n\n\nConclusions\nMuscleSound change scores acquired from an average of three ultrasound scans at the vastus lateralis site correlated significantly with change in vastus lateralis muscle glycogen content.\n\n These data support the use of the MuscleSound system for accurately and non-invasively estimating exercise-induced decreases in vastus lateralis skeletal muscle glycogen content.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4406335","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"David
