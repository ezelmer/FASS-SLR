During the Taiwan epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), many health care workers were infected. In an effort to establish a screening program for high risk personal, the distribution of HLA class I and II alleles in case and control groups was examined for the presence of an association to a genetic susceptibly or resistance to SARS coronavirus infection.\nMethods\nHLA-class I and II allele typing by PCR-SSOP was performed on 37 cases of probable SARS, 28 fever patients excluded later as probable SARS, and 101 non-infected health care workers who were exposed or possibly exposed to SARS coronavirus.

At first, when analyzing infected SARS patients and high risk health care workers groups, HLA-B*4601 (OR = 2.08, P = 0.04, Pc = n.s.) and HLA-B*5401 (OR = 5.44, P = 0.02, Pc = n.s.) appeared as the most probable elements that may be favoring SARS coronavirus infection. After selecting only a &quot;severe cases&quot; patient group from the infected &quot;probable SARS&quot; patient group and comparing them with the high risk health care workers group, the severity of SARS was shown to be significantly associated with HLA-B*4601 (P = 0.0008 or Pc = 0.0279).\nConclusions\nDensely populated regions with genetically related southern Asian populations appear to be more affected by the spreading of SARS infection. Up until recently, no probable SARS patients were reported among Taiwan indigenous peoples who are genetically distinct from the Taiwanese general population, have no HLA-B* 4601 and have high frequency of HLA-B* 1301. While increase of HLA-B* 4601 allele frequency was observed in the &quot;Probable SARS infected&quot; patient group, a further significant increase of the allele was seen in the &quot;Severe cases&quot; patient group. These results appeared to indicate association of HLA-B* 4601 with the severity of SARS infection in Asian populations. Independent studies are needed to test these results.\nBackground\nIn late April 2003, Taiwan was stroked by an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). A general SARS panic spread over the country when the Taipei Municipal Hoping hospital announced its shutdown as a preventive measure following heavy hospital infection. Further closedown of medical services, including emergency services, appeared sporadically in other hospitals and clinics all over the country. This caused great anxiety among all health care workers. On May 4, 2003, a suspected SARS patient with respiratory failure was brought to the Emergency Service of the Mackay Memorial Hospital in Taipei. The patient was admitted into SARS wards and died 24 hours later. However, during this short period the patient most likely infected 4 health care workers and 5 individuals who were either patients or visiting family members of other patients present at the same time. The hospital set up emergency procedures, and most manpower was put into caring of SARS patients. Taiwan hospitals were facing an unpredictable and invisible enemy for the first time in recent 50 years. The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system is widely used as a strategy in the search for the etiology of infectious diseases and autoimmune disorders. In this study we investigated the HLA-class I and II system for evidence of disease association. It was hoped that the discovery of disease susceptibility or a disease protection phenotype in the Taiwan population would help into setting up a preventive screening program for health care workers at risk.\nMethods\nPatients\nIn the course of March 19 to May 22, 2003, 93 cases of suspected SARS were reported by Mackay Memorial Hospital in Taipei City and its branch in Tan Sui County of Taipei to the Center for Disease Control in Taiwan. Up until early June, among 680 probable SARS cases reported in Taiwan, 71 (10.4%) cases were admitted to our hospital. Between May 5 and 26, 2003, 63 EDTA blood samples from fever patients with respiratory illness were collected in our hospitals. Two earlier specimens from the National Taiwan University Hospital (Taipei) were added to this study. Of the 65 (63+2) cases, 37 cases (table 1) were diagnosed as probable SARS cases according to updated WHO case definition for SARS (revised May 1, 2003). Three families were included (cases 31 and 32; cases 33 and 34; and cases 35, 36 and 37). Only the first infected patient in each family (cases 31, 33, 35) was retained for the analysis giving a final count of 33 probable SARS patients. Nine unrelated individuals (cases 7, 13, 18, 19, 21, 22, 26, 27, and 31) were infected from the same source (unfortunately this &quot;super-spreader&quot; probable SARS patient died 24 hours after admission in hospital and was not studied). Twenty eight cases of the 65 cases were not positive for SARS, and were referred as &quot;Excluded fever patients&quot; in tables 2 and 4. Among the &quot;Excluded fever patients&quot; group, two patients showed positive serological tests for M. pneumonias, one had tuberculosis, one patient presented lung edema, and the rest had no lung lesions.\nHLA-A, B, DRB1 allele typing of 37 probable SARS patients\nCase no	HLA-A	HLA-B	HLA-DRB1	 	1*	2402	3303	4601	5801	0301	0901	 	2*	0201/07	2402	1525	4601	0901	1202	 	3*	0201/07	2402	1513	4601	0403/06	1202	 	4*	1101/02	1101/02	4001	4601	0901	1401/07	 	5	1101/02	3303	4601	5801	0403/06	0901	 	6	0201/07	1101/02	4601	5502	0901	0901	 	7 	1101/02	1101/02	4601	5401	1101/04	1501/02	 	8	0201/07	2402	4601	1501/12/19	0901	1501/02	 	9	0201/07	3303	4601	5801	0803	1301/02	 	10	0203	2402	4601	5201	1001	1602	 	11	0201/07	3303	4601	4601	0901	1101/04	 	12	0201/07	1101/02	5201	5401	0405/10	1001	 	13 	0201/07	2402	5401	5801	0301	0405/10	 	14	1101/02	2402	1502	5401	0405/10	1401/07	 	15	0201/07	1101/02	4001	1502	1202	1501/02	 	16	1101/02	2402	5502	4001	0405/10	0901	 	17	0203	2402	2704	4001	0403/06	1602	 	18 	3303	3303	4001	5801	0301	0901	 	19 	0201/07	1101/02	1511	4001	0901	1602	 	20	2402	2402	4001	5801	0301	1201	 	21 	1101/02	1101/02	3901	4001	0403/06	1401/07	 	22*  	1101/02	2402	4001	8101	0901	1312	 	23	1101/02	3303	4001	4001	0803	0901	 	24	2402	3303	3901	5801	0901	1501/02	 	25	1101/02	1101/02	3901	4803	0803	1405	 	26 	2402	3303	3901	5801	0301	0901	 	27 	0203	1101/02	3802	3901	1101/04	1602	 	28	1101/02	3303	5102	5801	0301	1202	 	29	1101/02	2402	1502	1502	1202	1202	 	30	0201/07	1101/02	1301	4001	1401/07	1501/02	 	31 	0201/07	0301	0702	4601	1101/04	1501/02	 	32	0301	2402	0702	5502	1401/07	1501/02	 	33*	0201/07	0201/07	4601	4601	0901	1405	 	34	0201/07	1101/02	4601	4001	0901	1501/02	 	35	0201/07	1101/02	5401	1502	0405/10	1401/07	 	36	0201/07	1101/02	5401	4001	0405/10	1401/07	 	37	1101/02	1101/02	4001	1502	1401/07	1405	 	\nCases 31 and 32; cases 33 and 34 are mother- daughter pairs.

In addition, the following laboratory data was obtained from the 35 probable SARS patients managed in our hospital: 27% (10 cases) with reduced platelet count (&lt;150x10-9/liter), 59% (22 cases) with lymphocytopenia (&lt;1x10-9/liter), 70% (26 cases) with elevated LDH, 5% (2 cases) with elevated creatine kinase, 54% (20 cases) with elevated AST and /or ALT and 68% (25 cases) with elevated C-reactive protein. Fourteen cases were also tested for HBsAg, all showed negative results.\nSerum samples from 27 probable SARS cases were tested for Chlamydia pneumoniae, C. psittaci and C. trachomatis (Chlamydia IgM kit, Savyon Diagnostic, Israel), and 11 were further tested for IgG and IgA antibodies. All showed negative results. Among 24 probable SARS cases who had been tested for M. pneumoniae (IgM, Savyon Diagnostic, Israel), only two cases tested positive. These two cases also had diffuse bilateral lung lesions and positive SARS-CoV RNA test. It is possible that 8% of probable SARS cases were co-infected with M. pneumoniae. Finally, 15 cases were also tested for Legionella pneumophilia serogroup 1 antigen (Binax, US), and showed negative results.\nAll 37 probable cases revealed history of close or indirect contact with another suspected probable case of SARS. Three patients with severe respiratory failure airways had been intubated and mechanical ventilation was applied during hospitalization. Later, two patients died and one survived. Finally, among the 35 probable SARS cases of our hospital four patients died during hospitalization, giving an 11% mortality rate. Except for two rapid severe/fatal cases most probable SARS patients were admitted to the SARS wards for periods longer than two weeks. A final diagnosis of &quot;probable SARS&quot; was declared upon exclusion of all other possible causes.\nIn brief, 33 cases of &quot;probable SARS patients&quot; and 28 &quot;Excluded fever patients&quot; were retained for the analysis. This study was performed with approval of the ethics committee of the Mackay Memorial Hospital in Taipei.\nControls\nControl A\nBlood samples were obtained at the end of May 2003 from 62 health care workers who had possibly been exposed to coronavirus and were not infected. These 62 health care workers were either working at emergency services, SARS wards (doctors and nurses) or at the out patient clinic (phlebotomists) of our hospital in May 2003. These 62 health care workers were included in control A (table 2) and had followed World Health Organization (WHO) vigorous measures against infection. Another 39 blood samples from non-infected health care workers from the Taipei Municipal Hoping Hospital were added to control A. These 39 controls had been treating SARS patients in April 2003 without adequate protection from infection, and about 10% of health care workers from the same wards developed probable SARS. In brief, 101 high risk non-infected health care workers were retained as control A for the analysis. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects.\nControl B\nHLA-A, B and DRB1 typing of 190 normal healthy, unrelated Taiwanese was obtained from data collected in our laboratory and used as control B. For control B, HLA-A, B class I typing was performed by serological methods only. HLA-DRB1 typing was performed by allele typing as described below for the other groups.\nHLA allele typing\nBlood samples were collected in EDTA vacutainers. Buffy coat were lysed and genomic DNA was isolated by using proteinase K treatment and Q1Aamp blood kit (Q1Agen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Suspected SARS samples were processed in a bio-safety level-3 environment. Medium resolution allele typing for HLA-A, B and DRB1 loci was performed using PCR amplification followed by sequence-specific oligonucleotide probing (PCR-SSOP), (Dynal Biotech Ltd; Wirral, U.K.). Amplified sequences were hybridized to arrays of immobilized probes (35 probes for HLA-A, 56 for HLA-B, and 38 for HLA-DRB1).\nStatistical analysis\nHLA class I and class II allele frequencies were estimated by direct counting assuming that there was no blanks. Odds ratios (OR) were obtained from standard contingency table analysis using Haldane's modification of Woolf's method. Statistical significance was performed by a two tails Fisher's exact test. Since small size samples were used in the analysis, the risk of introducing a bias in estimating the probability (P-value) and wrongly accepting association (type I error) was corrected using the method of Edwards (7). In this method the P-value is multiplied by the number of independent comparisons at every locus, thereby giving a more powerful corrected P-value (Pc-value) that may be interpreted with confidence. Lastly, when analyzing serological data, data in the patient group were converted to serology typing using the World Health Organization nomenclature (WHO) table of correspondence.\nResults\nIn this study we performed allele typing on 37 probable SARS cases, 28 fever patients of suspected SARS (these 28 patients were later excluded for being non SARS patients), and 101 health care workers (control A) exposed or possibly exposed to SARS coronavirus but non-infected health care workers from Mackay Memorial Hospital and Taipei Municipal Hoping Hospital in Taiwan. HLA-A, B and DRB1 allele typing using PCR-SSOP method was performed on these cases. The HLA data of 190 healthy unrelated Taiwanese in our data bank was also used in this study as control B. HLA alleles typing of 37 probable SARS cases are shown in table 1.\nAnalysis between 33 retained unrelated probable SARS cases, 28 excluded fever patients, and two control groups (table 2) showed weak association to infection of HLA class I alleles (B* 4601, OR = 2.08, P = 0.04, Pc = n.s. and B* 5401, OR = 5.44, P = 0.02, Pc = n.s. with control A; and B* 3901/B39, OR = 3.81, P = 0.03, Pc = n.s. with control B). HLA-B* 4601 was not significant (n.s.) when testing analogous serotypes of the 33 probable SARS patients against the 190 healthy unrelated Taiwanese of control B (OR = 1.86, P = 0.06, Pc = n.s.) (table 2). HLA-B* 1301 is a common HLA allele in Taiwan, the number of HLA-B* 1301 alleles seen in control A and control B were 18 (8.9%) and 34 (8.9%), respectively (table 2). Unexpectedly, only one HLA-B* 1301 allele was found among the 33 probable SARS cases (case 30, table 1, 2). When testing HLA-B* 1301 with the 33 probable SARS cases, both control A and control B showed elevated odds ratios (OR = 0.16, P = 0.03, Pc = n.s. and OR = 0.16, P = 0.02, Pc = n.s., respectively).\nThe 33 probable SARS patients also included 6 severe cases among whom three were patients who had been intubated for mechanical ventilation and five were deceased (table 1). Except for case 22 (table 1 and 3), the remaining five cases carried HLA-B* 4601. Case 22, however was a 91 years old man suffering from chronic renal failure, peptic ulcer and coronary heart disease. The cause of death of this patient was unlikely due to SARS alone and the case was removed from this group. The remaining 5 cases, labeled &quot;Deceased or intubated probable SARS patients&quot; in table 4, were retained for the analysis on the severity of SARS. The association of HLA class I and the severity of SARS was evidenced by an important increase of the odds ratio of HLA-B* 4601 in the deceased or intubated probable SARS patient group against all other groups, notably with the 28 excluded fever patients (OR = 7.83, P = 0.007, Pc = n.s.) and with control A (OR = 10.62, P = 0.0008, Pc = 0.0279) (table 4). HLA-B* 5401 and HLA-B* 3901/B39 did not show association with the severity of SARS infection (data not shown).\nDiscussion\nHLA-B gene was found to be associated with susceptibility or protection from infection when analyzing descendants of Dutch colonists' survivors of 19th Century yellow fever and typhoid epidemics. Other studies also indicated that HLA variations were associated with susceptibility or resistance to malaria, tuberculosis, leprosy, HIV and hepatitis virus persistence. In ethnic Thai, HLA-A and B alleles were confirmed to be associated with disease severity and clinical outcome of exposure to dengue virus in previously exposed immunologically primed individuals. Moreover, direct evidence of human coronavirus OC43 interaction with HLA class I molecules at the cell surface to establish infection was also described. Consequently we carried out a study to analyze the relation between HLA class I and class II alleles, in SARS coronavirus infection, and/or the severity of the disease. In this study, no association between HLA class II allele and SARS coronavirus infection was seen. Although HLA-B* 4601 frequency in the 33 probable SARS patients (table 2) was only slightly higher than the frequencies seen in control A or control B (P = 0.04, Pc = n.s. and P = 0.06, Pc = n.s., respectively). On the contrary, the frequency of HLA-B* 4601 in the five severe cases (table 4) was slightly increased when compared to the 28 excluded fever patients (P = 0.007, Pc = ns), but the difference was clearly significant when compared to control A (P = 0.0008, Pc = 0.03). This increased HLA-B* 4601 difference was unique to the five severe cases patients and may indicate association with the severity of SARS. A susceptibly of HLA-B* 5401/B54 or B* 3901/B39 to infection rather than to the severity of the disease (table 2) could not be concluded upon (Pc = n.s.) and requires further studies. HLA-B13 is widely distributed throughout Asia where it is mostly represented by HLA-B* 1301 (4-30%) and rarely by B* 1302 (0-2%) [Unpublished data]. Furthermore, HLA-B13 is seen with frequencies greater than 16% among most indigenous tribes of the central mountain area in Taiwan and in the Taiwanese (9.1%). In this study, we found that presence of HLA-B* 1301/B13 was decreased in the 33 probable SARS patients when compared with the two control groups A (OR = 0.16, P = 0.03, Pc = n.s.) or B (OR = 0.16, P = 0.02, Pc = n.s.). However, only the analysis of a larger case-control data set would confirm or refute association of HLA-B* 1301 with resistance to coronavirus infection.\nTaiwan population is heterogeneous and comprises 91% Taiwanese, 7.5% Chinese who arrived from many different provinces of China after World War II, and 1.5% of indigenous peoples established there since several millenniums. The Taiwanese comprised the Minnan and Hakka people groups, and are the descendants of early settlers from the southeast coast of China (Fujian and Guangdong Provinces) during the last few centuries. The genetic profile of the Taiwanese shows many affinities to southern Asian populations and share the same origin with Singapore Chinese and Thai Chinese who also originated from the southeast coast of China. According to archeological evidences, the populations in the delta of the Hong River in northern Vietnam are also likely related to these populations. After the outbreak of SARS coronavirus infection in the Guangdong Province of China, it was surprising to observe that the spreading of the disease was mostly confined among southern Asian populations (Hong-Kong peoples, Vietnamese, Singaporeans and Taiwanese). Density of populations possibly favored the growth of the epidemic. The question aroused as to whether affected southern Asian populations were more susceptible to SARS infection than peoples of northern China (Beijing), Japan, or Korea. Many peoples in Beijing generally considered as northern Chinese, were also infected, however, infection in Beijing could be attributed to heterogeneity of populations following important recent migration of southern Chinese and population resettlement during the Cultural Revolution.\nThe probable SARS cases in this report consist mainly of southern Chinese origin Taiwanese (non indigenous peoples). Contraction of SARS by Taiwan indigenous individuals from any of the nine tribes of Taiwan has not yet been reported to this day. It is possible that the HLA make up of the Taiwan indigenous peoples has little in common to the Taiwanese and may not contain any element favoring SARS infection. Also, HLA-B* 4601/B46 displays higher frequencies in Southern Han (15.4%), in Singaporean (15.1%) and in Vietnamese (13.2%) than in Northern Han (2.8%), but the allele has rarely been seen among indigenous peoples except in children of intermarriage between Taiwanese and indigenous peoples. Interestingly, HLA-B* 4601/B46 is also seldom seen in Europeans populations where very few cases of SARS infection of individuals of European origin were reported.\nThe presence or absence of HLA-B* 4601 in a population appeared to be an important element that acted during the outbreak of the SARS epidemic. Certainly, further independent studies are still needed to confirm this hypothesis. However, Taiwan indigenous peoples have no HLA-B* 4601 and have very low population density. This does not exclude that they may have avoided infection only by chance, even though many indigenous peoples are now urbanized and would have run the same risk as Taiwanese. Southern Asian peoples, not only live in highly densely populated regions, but also have less variation in their HLA related immune repertoires than European or African populations [Variation was inferred here from the heterozygosity (h = 1 - sum of squares of allele frequencies) seen in these populations, and h was obtained and calculated (data not shown) from published data [18]], which as a whole creates a favorable factor for rapid settling of any epidemic. It becomes evident that authorities must keep a state of disease awareness at all times. Little is known on the routes of infection of SARS coronavirus. In this study, the effect of HLA alleles on the resistance or susceptibility to SARS coronavirus infection was shown to be associated to class I alleles. No association with class II alleles was seen. Quickly establishing a procedure of mass screening for health care workers at risk of exposure to SARS coronavirus by detecting HLA-B* 4601 and possibly HLA-B* 1301 alleles appears justified. The results of such screening would help hospitals to better guard their personals against infection, make the workplace safer, and help to ease the tension and anxiety seen in the hospital environment.\nPre-publication history\nThe pre-publication history for this paper can be accessed here:\nCase definition for surveillance of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)\nControl measures

of SARS. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE1) insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism was previously reported to show association with the adult respiratory distress syndrome, which is also thought to play a key role in damaging the lung tissues in SARS cases. This time, the polymorphism was genotyped in 44 Vietnamese SARS cases, with 103 healthy controls who had had a contact with the SARS patients and 50 controls without any contact history. SARS cases were divided into either non-hypoxemic or hypoxemic groups. Despite the small sample size, the frequency of the D allele was significantly higher in the hypoxemic group than in the non-hypoxemic group (p = 0.013), whereas there was no significant difference between the SARS cases and controls, irrespective of a contact history. ACE1 might be one of the candidate genes that influence the progression of pneumonia in SARS.\nThe severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) spread worldwide as an emergent pneumonia. Typical clinical features of SARS are high fever, myalgia, and other symptoms caused by systemic inflammation and the subsequent atypical pneumonia. Approximately 40% of SARS cases developed hypoxemia and further advanced cases were presented as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Pathological analysis of the lung at autopsy in cases of SARS revealed diffuse alveolar damage, characterized by desquamation of pneumocytes, inflammatory infiltrates, edema, and hyaline-membrane formation. Such pathological feature of the lung in SARS cases was consistent with that in ARDS.\nThe early reports showed that higher age, diabetes mellitus, and heart disease are risk factors for the prognosis of SARS, whereas there has been so far little discussion on contribution of genetic factors for the development or progression of SARS. To date, there are only a few reports showing genetic involvement in ARDS as well. In the present study, we focused on the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) deletion (D) allele that was once reported to be associated with poor outcome in ARDS.\nACE is a metallopeptidase that converts angiotensin I (AT-I) to angiotensin II (AT-II), acting as a vasoconstrictor, and it also degrades bradykinin, acting as a vasodilator. ACE is a prototype of angiotensin converting enzyme, which is distinct from its human homologue ACE2 also known as a SARS receptor. It is well known that ACE is rich in microvascular endothelium and is likely involved in angiopathy of the lung. The human ACE gene on chromosome 17q23 consists of 26 exons, and has insertion (I) or deletion (D) of a 287-bp Alu repeat sequence in intron 16. Although the function of this polymorphism remains unclear, the genotype or allele frequency of this polymorphism has been often reported to be associated with pathological status including the development of myocardial infarction and deterioration of the renal function in diabetes mellitus in humans. In the present study, we explored the possibility of this polymorphism, based on the assumption that it might be associated with progression of SARS in Vietnamese cases.\nAlthough Vietnam experienced the outbreak of SARS in February 2003, they successfully controlled SARS and Vietnam was removed from the list of the affected areas just nine weeks later. Consequently, in Vietnam, there were 62 probable cases of SARS; 87% was nosocomial infection in a single hospital and the community-acquired infection was only 13%.\nMaterials and methods\n Study population. This study was reviewed and approved by Ethics Committees in Ministry of Health of Vietnam as well as International Medical Center of Japan. Out of 62 cases fulfilling the World Health Organization case definition of probable SARS, five cases died, three were not Vietnamese, such that they were excluded from this study. In the remaining 54, written informed consent was obtained from 44 individuals, who were enrolled in this study as cases. Furthermore, 103 staff members who came in contact with SARS patients in the hospital A without development of SARS, and 50 individuals reflecting general Vietnamese population who had no contact history participated in this study. Peripheral blood sample of all the subjects was taken, blood cells were separated from plasma by centrifuge method, and genomic DNA was subsequently extracted by a method described elsewhere.\n Genotyping of ACE I/D polymorphism. ACE I/D genotype was determined by three-primer polymerase chain reaction amplification method that was described previously. Briefly, primers ACE1 and ACE3 were chosen outside the insertion sequence and another primer ACE2 was placed on the insertion sequence. Reactions were performed with 25 pmol of each primer ACE1 and ACE3, and with 7.5 pmol of primer ACE2 in a final volume of 25 mul, containing 1.5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 0.001% (W/V) of gelatin, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, and 1 U Taq polymerase (AmpriTaq Gold DNA polymerase, Applied Biosystems).\nNucleotide sequences of primers were as follows: ACE1: 5'-CATCCTTTCTCCCATTTCTC-3', ACE2: 5'-TGGGATTACAGGCGTGATACAG-3', and ACE3: 5'-ATTTCAGAGCTGGAATAAAATT-3'.\nAfter the initial denaturation at 94  C for 10 min, the reaction mixture was subjected to 30 cycles of 94  C for 1 min and 55  C for 1 min. This method yields amplification products of 84 bp for the D allele and 65 bp for the I allele, and products were electrophoresed and visualized on 4% agarose gels with ethidium bromide.\n Clinical profiles and backgrounds of the subjects. Clinical profiles and backgrounds of all subjects were extracted from medical records and questionnaires taken by trained interviewers. Information about age, sex, degree of contacts with SARS patients, and requirement of supplementary oxygen was obtained. Chest radiographs of SARS cases on the acute phase were also available. Entire lung field on the chest X-ray films was divided into six zones, which were right upper, middle, and lower zones and left upper, middle, and lower zones. The number of affected zones on the film where the lung is most severely inflamed during the clinical course was counted in each case. Two different chest physicians judged the number of involved zones in the entire lung field independently.\n Statistical analysis. Disease associations were assessed by the chi 2 test. Inter-observer variability for the number of involved zones in the lung was assessed with the Spearman rank correlation coefficient. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of hypoxemia or progression of SARS. The p values less than 0.05 were considered significant in all the tests and data analysis was carried out using the SAS system for Windows version 8.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).\nResults\nDemographics\nCharacteristics of SARS cases and healthy contacts\nCharacteristics	SARS cases (n = 44)	Contacts (n = 103)	 	Age (years), mean [range]	39.3 [17-76]	36.5 [15-68]	 	Male/female	13/31	46/57	 	 :  : 			 	Underlying diseases			 	Diabetes mellitus	0	0	 	Hypertension	2	1	 	Heart disease	0	0	 	Lung disease			 	 COPD	3	2	 	 Bronchial asthma	0	2	 	 Tuberculosis	1	1	 	 Pulmonary embolism	0	1	 	 :  : 			 	Contact status			 	Direct	37	63	 	Indirect	7	40	 	 :  : 			 	Occupation			 	Nurse	16	24	 	Doctor	5	13	 	Co-medical staff	8	22	 	Non-medical staff	1	44	 	Visitor	2	:	 	Inpatient	2	:	 	Family or maid of patient	5	:	 	Others	5	:	 	\nDemographic information of 44 SARS cases and 103 healthy contacts in this study is shown in Table 1 . Of the 44 cases, 13 were male and 31 were female. Their mean age was 39.3 years old. Two cases had hypertension but they had neither diabetes mellitus nor heart disease. Of the 103 healthy contacts, 46 were male and 57 were female. Their mean age was 36.5 years old and this was comparable with that of SARS patients. One case had hypertension.\nIndividuals who faced SARS patients directly were defined as &quot;direct contacts.&quot; Health care workers working in the hospital A during the outbreak but did not come in direct contact with SARS patient were described as &quot;indirect contacts.&quot;\nValidation of parameters for progression of SARS\nCharacteristics of subgroups of SARS cases\nCharacteristics	SARS cases (n = 44)	 		Non-hypoxemic group	Hypoxemic group	 		(n = 22)	(n = 22)	Without mechanical ventilation (n = 17)	With mechanical ventilation (n = 5)	 	Age (year), mean	37.7	41.0	36.8	55.4	 	Male/female (n)	6/16	7/15	5/12	2/3	 	Direct/indirect contact (n)	19/3	18/4	16/1	2/3	 	\nBased on the requirement of supplementary oxygen when pneumonia deteriorated, cases were separated into two groups. Oxygen was supplied to maintain a partial pressure of arterial oxygen of higher than 60 mm Hg, or arterial oxygen saturation of more than 90% at room air on the basis of Provisional guidelines issued by Ministry of Health in Vietnam. Half of the cases did not require supplementary oxygen and were defined as &quot;non-hypoxemic&quot; group and the other half required supplementary oxygen and constituted &quot;hypoxemic&quot; group (Table 2 ). Five cases of the hypoxemic group further received mechanical ventilation because they could not keep spontaneous breathing.\nThe number of involved lung zones on chest radiographs in the subgroups of SARS cases\nNumber of involved zones	Non-hypoxemic group (n = 22)	Hypoxemic group (n = 22)	 	One	14	1	 	Two	6	6	 	Three	2	2	 	More than three	0	13	 	\nSerial chest X-rays were taken in all cases during the acute stage. We compared the number of involved lung zones with requirement of supplementary oxygen (Table 3 ). Assessment of the number of involved lung zone correlated well between two medical observers (Spearman rank correlation coefficient, r  = 0.879, p  &lt; 0.0001). The number of involved lung zones was significantly associated with requirement of supplementary oxygen (chi 2 value = 31.5; df = 3; p  &lt; 0.0001). In 13 out of 22 cases with hypoxia, more than three zones of the lung were involved on chest X-rays, whereas in 14 out of 22 cases without hypoxia, only one zone was involved.\nGenotypic and allele frequencies of ACE I/D polymorphism\nGenotypic and allele frequencies of ACE I/D polymorphisms in SARS cases and controls\n	SARS cases	Controls	References	 		(n = 44)	With contact (n = 103)	Without contact (n = 50)	Japanese (n = 341) 	Chinese (n = 102) 	Korean (n = 135) 	British (n = 1903) 	 	Genotype frequency	 	DD	6 (13.6%)	12 (11.7%)	3 (6.0%)	13.1%	16.7%	24.4%	26.1%	 	DI	17 (38.6%)	44 (42.7%)	25 (50.0%)	40.5%	47.0%	43.0%	49.8%	 	II	21 (47.8%)	47 (45.6%)	22 (44.0%)	46.3%	36.3%	32.6%	24.1%	 	 :  : 								 	Allele frequency	 	D	0.33	0.33	0.31	0.33	0.4	0.46	0.51	 	I	0.67	0.67	0.69	0.67	0.6	0.54	0.49	 	\nGenotypic distribution and allele frequency of the ACE I/D polymorphism in SARS cases and controls with or without contact history to SARS patients were compared (Table 4 ). Genotypic and allele frequencies of ACE I/D polymorphism were not different among those groups. Roughly, one-third of the alleles were D in the Vietnamese population, which were comparable with the previous data from Asians including Japanese and Chinese, but quite different from those in British population, where a half of them were D allele.\nGenotypic and allele frequencies of ACE I/D polymorphism in the subgroups of SARS cases\n	SARS cases (n = 44)	 		Non-hypoxemic group (n = 22)	Hypoxemic group (n = 22)	 	Genotype frequency	 	DD	1 (4.5%)	5 (22.7%)	 	DI	7 (31.8%)	10 (45.5%)	 	II	14 (63.6%)	7 (31.8%)	 	 :  : 			 	Allele frequency	 	D	0.2	0.45	 	I	0.8	0.55	 	\nAs shown in Table 5 , frequency of the D allele of the hypoxemic group was significantly higher than that of the non-hypoxemic group (9 of 44 alleles versus 20 of 44 alleles; chi 2 value = 6.22, df = 1, p  = 0.013).\nLogistic regression analysis on progression of SARS\nLogistic regression analysis on hypoxemia of SARS\nVariable	Odds ratio (95% CI)	p value	 	Univariate analysis	 	ACE (No. of D allele)	3.04 (1.15-8.02)	0.025	 	 :  : 			 	Multivariate analysis	 	ACE (No. of D allele)	3.04 (1.12-8.25)	0.029	 	Age (&gt;60 years)	2.12 (0.19-24.1)	0.546	 	Female	1.07 (0.25-4.52)	0.928	 	Direct contact	0.53 (0.09-3.12)	0.484	 	\nIn a univariate logistic regression analysis, the number of ACE D allele in SARS cases was a significant risk factor for hypoxemia of SARS cases (odds ratio 3.04; 95% CI 1.15-8.02; p  = 0.025) (Table 6 ). Even when age, gender, and contact status were added to the ACE allele to carry out multivariate logistic regression analysis, contribution of the D allele as a risk factor for hypoxemia was still robust (Table 6). Age did not contribute to this parameter. However, the mean age of 5 hypoxemic cases that received mechanical ventilation was 55.6 and obviously higher than 36.6 of hypoxemic cases that did not require mechanical ventilation (Table 2). Comparison of parameters between survivors and non-survivors was not possible, because no DNA samples were available from non-survivors.\nDiscussion\nIn Vietnam, 87% of SARS cases were medical staff members, in-patients with another disease or visitors to the hospital in question. Although a standard precaution was taken, this nosocomial infection was neither modified by isolation of patients nor protected by measures such as wearing N95 masks against the new pathogen, because the cause of this atypical pneumonia was unknown in the early phase of the outbreak. All the infection spread originally from one case from Hong Kong within 2 months. It implies that natural course of nosocomial infection of SARS was observed in Vietnam. This was an unfortunate event but was a major advantage for us to assess genetic risk factors, minimizing other confounding factors. Moreover, the study population was limited to be Vietnamese ethnicity for genetic analysis. Questionnaires taken by trained interviewers and chest radiographs of all cases in this study, and clinical records of most of the cases were available to evaluate clinical status in detail. As a result, 44 out of 54 accessible cases of ethnic of Vietnamese were enrolled and this achieved high coverage of this study. Although the number of cases is not enough to reach a definite conclusion in a case-control design, we were able to extract an attractive candidate gene in this study.\nHerein, 50% of the cases required supplementary oxygen. This was comparable with a report by others. Oxygen was given on the basis of local guidelines, when hypoxemia was detected at room air. There was a close correlation between the number of involved zones of chest radiography and status of supplementary oxygen; therefore, we considered that progression of SARS in the lung is reasonably evaluated by the requirement of supplementary oxygen.\nIn the SARS cases, the frequency of D allele in hypoxemic group was higher than that of non-hypoxemic group with statistical significance, despite the small sample size. This indicates that ACE gene could be one of the candidates which influence the progression of SARS, although another gene that is located close to the gene may be responsible for the disease. The frequency of D allele of SARS cases was not different from that of the healthy contacts, and the D allele did not appear to influence development of SARS itself. There was also no difference in the frequency of D allele between healthy contacts and non-contacts. In other words, contact history did not affect the genotype distribution.\nMost severe cases of SARS show diffuse alveolar damage. This pathological status is characterized by increased permeability of alveolar-capillary barrier, which consists of two separate barriers, microvascular endothelium and alveolar epithelium. When these barriers are damaged, the permeability of alveolar-capillary barrier increases and protein-rich edema fluids flow into alveolar spaces from blood vessel. A previous report indicated that AT-I increased vascular permeability in Rat. Another report showed that AT-II induces apoptosis of human alveolar epithelial cells. The degree of epithelial injury seems to influence the outcome of ARDS. The serum ACE levels of individuals who have genotype DD are almost twice as high as that of genotype II. It is conceivable that D allele might influence the activity of renin-angiotensin system via elevation of serum or local ACE level, and then this may lead to damage of endothelium or epithelium of the lung.\nIn this study, neither higher age nor underlying disease was found to be risk factors for hypoxemia in SARS. One of the reasons might be that SARS cases in Vietnam were mostly nosocomial infection among relatively young medical staff members who did not have underlying diseases. This situation may be different from ones in other countries. However, as described above, the number of cases that had specific underlying diseases, which may influence the prognosis of SARS, was too few to conclude the role of underlying disease as a risk factor in our cases.\nAlthough no case of SARS had cardiovascular disorders or diabetes mellitus in Vietnam, it is interesting that heart disease and diabetes mellitus have been reported to be risk factors in the prognosis of SARS cases in other countries where incidence rates of these life-style related diseases are rather high. The ACE insertion/deletion polymorphism has also been reported to be a risk factor of the diseases mentioned above and this might be associated with systemic angiopathy and influence progression of SARS in the lung.\nThe reason why we used hypoxia as a parameter of disease progression and did not use other parameters such as requirement of mechanical ventilation or outcome of death was that there were only 5 cases which required mechanical ventilation in our samples tested and no samples were obtained from the fatal cases. Autopsies were not performed in Vietnamese SARS patients for religious reasons. It would promote further studies to clarify genetic predisposition of infection, development or progression of SARS in the near future in other countries where a larger number of cases were reported.\nIn conclusion, we showed that ACE insertion/deletion polymorphism was statistically associated with hypoxemic status in SARS cases of Vietnam. Genetic predisposition may be one of the risk factors for the progression of SARS.\nReferences\nWorld Health Organization, Consensus document on the epidemiology of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Available from: &lt;http://www.who.int/csr/sars/en/WHOconsensus.pdf&gt; (accessed 27 May 2004)\nThe severe acute respiratory syndrome\nSARS Northern Vietnam\nClinical description of a completed outbreak of SARS in Vietnam, February-May 2003\nHKU/UCH SARS study group, clinical progression and viral load in a community outbreak of coronavirus-associated SARS pneumonia: a prospective study\nLung pathology of fatal severe acute respiratory syndrome\nLung pathology of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS): a study of 8 autopsy cases from Singapore\nPulmonary pathological features in coronavirus associated severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)\nClinical features and short-term outcomes of 144 patients with SARS in the greater Toronto area\nShort term outcome and risk factors for adverse clinical outcomes in adults with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)\nAssociation of HLA class I with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection\nAssociation of human-leukocyte-antigen class I (B*0703) and class II (DRB1*0301) genotypes with susceptibility and resistance to the development of severe acute respiratory syndrome\nAngiotensin converting enzyme insertion/deletion polymorphism is associated with susceptibility and outcome in acute respiratory distress syndrome\nPolymorphisms of human SP-A, SP-B, and SP-D genes: association of SP-B Thr131Ile with ARDS\nAngiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a functional receptor for the SARS coronavirus\nAn insertion/deletion polymorphism in the angiotensin I-converting enzyme gene accounting for half the variance of serum enzyme levels\nNew aspects on angiotensin-converting enzyme: from gene to disease\nWorld Health Organization, Global surveillance for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Wkly.

In multivariate logistic analysis, age is the only factor associated with the development of ARDS while age and male sex are independent factors associated with the requirement of intensive care.\nConclusion\nThe ACE I/D polymorphism is not directly related to increased susceptibility to SARS-coronavirus infection and is not associated with poor outcomes after SARS-coronavirus infection.\nBackground\nThe outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has made a great impact to the health care systems around the world. The pandemic affected over 8000 individuals and resulted in 774 deaths worldwide. Several clinical parameters, including male sex, age of over 60 years, elevated lactate dehydrogenase activity, low platelet count and high viral load on presentation, have been identified to be predictive of the severity of the disease in affected individuals. Moreover, it has been postulated that genetic variations of the host and the virus may account for the individual difference in the susceptibility to the infection and the severity of the disease. With regard to viral factors, it has been shown that there is no significant difference in the genetic sequences of viruses causing the two major outbreaks in Hong Kong, namely the Prince of Wales Hospital and Amoy Gardens outbreaks, despite the significant difference in the mortality rates and diarrheal rates of the two cohorts. Furthermore, several association studies have been conducted to investigate the possible contribution of host genetic factors in the determination of the susceptibility and prognosis of SARS-coronavirus infection. Thus, certain human leukocyte antigen subtypes have been shown to be more prevalent in SARS patients and in those who had poorer outcomes. On the other hand, the polymorphism in the angiotensin converting enzyme II gene, coding for a functional receptor of the SARS-coronavirus, is not associated with the susceptibility or outcome of SARS. Recently, it has also been reported that the deletion of the 287 bp Alu repeat (D allele) in intron 16 of the ACE gene is associated with hypoxemia in SARS patients. However, there are several limitations to this previous study. First, only 44 SARS patients were studied. Second, hypoxemia was arbitrarily defined as requiring oxygen supplementation. Moreover, patients who died were excluded from the study. These factors may be potential confounders to a genetic association study.\nTherefore, in this study, we investigated the association of the ACE insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the 287 bp Alu repeat to the susceptibility to SARS and the development of adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with a larger population.\nMethods\nStudy population\nThis study was reviewed and approved by the Ethical Committee of the Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong. Patients who were admitted to the hospitals of the New Territories East cluster of Hong Kong for the treatment of SARS were recruited retrospectively. The recruitment of patients depended on the availability of blood samples. All patients, including survivors and deceased patients, with available blood samples were recruited. For genetically related SARS patients, only the index case (the first individual who developed symptoms) was recruited. All patients were of Chinese ethnicity and fulfilled the World Health Organisation case definition of probable SARS. Three hundred and twenty-six healthy individuals undergoing routine health check were recruited as controls. The control subjects were recruited before the SARS epidemic and none of them had respiratory symptoms. All control subjects were ethnical Chinese and were not genetically related.\nDefinition of adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and patients with severe disease\nThe association between genotype and disease outcome was studied in the SARS patients. Two categories of patients were considered as having a severe disease: (1) patients who developed ARDS; and (2) patients who required admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). A patient was classified as having ARDS if he or she fulfilled all criteria of the joint American/European Consensus for ARDS, including: (1) acute onset of respiratory distress; (2) presence of bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray; (3) having a ratio of arterial partial pressure of oxygen to inspired fractional oxygen concentration (PaO2/FiO2) of less than 26.8 kPa and absence of clinical evidence of left heart failure.\nACE Genotyping\nDNA was extracted from whole blood using a QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen) with the 'Blood and Body Fluid Spin protocol' as recommended by the manufacturer. ACE I/D genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction amplification. The forward and reverse primers were 5'-CTGGAGACCACTCCCATCCTTTCT-3' and 5'-GATGTGGCCATCACATTCGTCAGAT-3', respectively. Reactions were set up in a volume of 25 mul containing 0.1 muM of each primer, 1X buffer II (Applied Biosystems), 2 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 1.25 U Taq polymerase (AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase, Applied Biosystems) and 20 ng DNA. After initial denaturation at 95 C for 12 min, the reaction mixtures were subjected to 40 cycles of 94 C for 1 min, 58 C for 1 min and 72 C for 1 min, and a final extension at 72 C for 5 min. This method yielded amplification products of 480 bp for the I allele and 192 bp for the D allele. The products were electrophoresed and visualized in 2% agarose gels with ethidium bromide.\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were performed using SigmaStat, Ver. 3.0; SPSS. Disease associations were compared by chi-square tests. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of ARDS or the outcome of SARS.\nResults\nDemographics\nOne hundred and forty SARS patients (67 males, 73 females) and 326 healthy individuals (172 males, 154 females) were recruited. The mean ages of the SARS patients and control subjects were 39.9 and 42.5 years, respectively (p = 0.93). Seventeen of the 140 SARS patients developed ARDS during the course of their illness. The demographic data of the SARS patients who had or had not developed ARDS are summarized in table 1. Patients who developed ARDS were significantly older than those who did not develop ARDS (p &lt; 0.001). There was no significant difference in gender, smoking habits, hepatitis B status and the presence of comorbidity between the two groups. Thirty-five patients required intensive care and sixteen died. Patients who required intensive care were significantly older than those with milder disease.\nDemographic data of SARS patients. The patients are categorized by the development of ARDS (ARDS vs non-ARDS). All patients who had developed ARDS required intensive care. The numbers listed in the table represent the number of patients (except the numbers list in the first row which signify age).\n	ARDS	non-ARDS	 	Age mean (range)	59.1 years (24-83)	36.9 years (21-76)	 	M:F	9/8	58/65	 	Smoking	2	5	 	HbsAg positive	0	7	 	Comorbidities			 	  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease	0	3	 	  Ischemic heart disease	5	2	 	  Cerebral vascular disease	3	4	 	  Cancer	0	2	 	  Diabetes mellitus	1	6	 	  Chronic renal disease	0	1	 	  Liver cirrhosis	0	1	 	\nGenotypic and allelic frequencies of ACE I/D polymorphism\nThe genotypic distributions and allelic frequencies of ACE I/D polymorphism in the SARS patients and control subjects are shown in table 2. The genotypic distributions of the SARS patients and the healthy control subjects follow the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium using chi-square analysis. There was no significant difference in the genotypic distributions (chi2 value = 1.43, df = 2, p = 0.489) and allelic frequencies (chi2 value = 0.000624, df = 1, p = 0.980) of the two groups. Among the SARS patients, we further analyzed the genotypic distributions and allelic frequencies of ACE I/D polymorphism in patients who developed ARDS and in those who did not develop ARDS in the course of their illness. The results are shown in table 3a. There was no significant difference in the genotypic distributions (chi2 value = 4.361, df = 2, p = 0.113) and allelic frequencies (chi2 value = 1.376, df = 1, p = 0.241) between the two groups. Besides, there was also no significant difference in the genotypic distributions (chi2 value = 2.489, df = 2, p = 0.288) and allelic frequencies (chi2 value = 1.424, df = 1, p = 0.233) between patients who did or did not require intensive care.

Following multivariate logistic regression analysis, age was found to be the only significant factor that determined the development of ARDS in SARS patients (table 4a). In the multivariate analysis for the requirement of intensive care, we have shown that age and male sex are associated with the requirement of intensive care (table 4b).\nLogistic regression on the development of ARDS in SARS patients\nVariables	Univariate analysis	Multivariate analysis	 			 		Odds ratio (95% CI)	p value	Odds ratio (95% CI)	p value	 	ACE (no. of D allele)	0.64 (0.28 - 1.47)	0.30	0.74 (0.27 - 1.98)	0.46	 	Age	1.08 (1.04 - 1.12)	&lt;0.01	1.10 (1.04 - 1.16)	&lt;0.01	 	Male sex	1.26 (0.46 - 3.48)	0.65	0.22 (0.04 - 1.10)	0.06	 	Smoking	3.15 (0.56 - 17.67)	0.19	1.03 (0.11 - 9.65)	0.98	 	HbsAg	1 (0 -  )	0.99	1 (0.00 -  )	0.99	 	Co-morbidities	6.15 (2.11 - 17.96)	&lt;0.01	1.61 (0.36 - 7.26)	0.53	 	\nLogistic regression on the requirement of intensive care in SARS patients\nVariables	Univariate analysis	Multivariate analysis	 			 		Odds ratio (95% CI)	p value	Odds ratio (95% CI)	p value	 	ACE (no. of D allele)	0.69 (0.38 - 1.27)	0.23	0.77 (0.39 - 1.51)	0.46	 	Age	1.06 (1.03 - 1.08)	&lt;0.01	1.06 (1.02 - 1.09)	&lt;0.01	 	Male sex	4.50 (1.92 - 10.58)	&lt;0.01	3.20 (1.25 - 8.19)	0.02	 	Smoking	2.37 (0.50 - 11.14)	0.28	0.68 (0.10 - 4.52)	0.69	 	HbsAg	2.37 (0.50 - 11.14)	0.28	2.73 (0.52 - 14.43)	0.24	 	Co-morbidities	6.15 (2.11 - 17.96)	&lt;0.01	1.61 (0.36 - 7.26)	0.53	 	\nDiscussion\nThe possible contribution of host genetic factors to the susceptibility and outcome of SARS-coronavirus infection has been investigated through several association studies. In contrast to a recent report showing an association between the presence of the D allele of the ACE gene and hypoxemia in SARS patients, we have shown that the I/D polymorphism of the ACE gene is associated with neither increased susceptibility to SARS-coronavirus infection nor progression to ARDS once infected. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, we have identified that age is the only significant factor associated with the development of ARDS while age and male sex are independently associated with the requirement of intensive care in SARS patients. Our findings are consistent with other published reports.\nThere are several possible explanations for the discrepancies in our conclusion and that by Itoyama et al concerning the association between ACE polymorphism and the outcome of SARS. First, the inclusion of subjects within the same family and exclusion of deceased patients by the previous study might cause potential bias, especially when the frequency of the DD genotype was reported to be as low as 6% in control subjects. In this study, we have only included the index patient if more than one member in a family developed SARS. Second, we have used a well defined endpoint of ARDS instead of the requirement of supplemental oxygen. SARS infection commonly leads to respiratory distress and over 80% of patients were given supplemental oxygen during the course of their illness in our cohort. Therefore, it seems to be more appropriate to use ARDS instead of the requirement of oxygen supplement to define the severity of SARS. As ARDS is the more severe end of the spectrum of disease progression, any potential association between genotype and disease progression would become even more obvious when the most severe cases were considered. Similarly, the disease outcome was not associated with ACE I/D genotype when we also used another broader definition for severe disease after SARS infection (requiring intensive care or death).\nPrevious studies on Caucasian populations have suggested that the presence of the D allele of the ACE gene is associated with increased incidence of ARDS. This effect has been postulated to be related to the higher enzyme activity in individuals with DD genotype. However, it is unclear whether these observations can also be seen in Chinese as the frequencies of DD genotype and D allele of the ACE gene are much lower in Chinese than in Caucasian subjects. Furthermore, the SARS-coronavirus characteristically affects the pneumocytes, and the formation of multinucleated pneumocytes and intrabronchial fibrogranulation (bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia-like lesions) are commonly observed in the lung biopsies of SARS patients in addition to the typical pathological changes of ARDS. Therefore, it is possible that the pathogenesis and genetic factors predisposing to SARS-related ARDS may be different from ARDS resulted from other respiratory illnesses.\nPrevious reports have highlighted the inconsistency of the results of genetic association studies for complex diseases. This inconsistency may be attributable to the difference in the genetic composition of the studied population and study design. Here, we showed that both susceptibility and disease outcome of SARS infection were not associated with ACE I/D polymorphism among Chinese patients in contrast to the recent report studying Vietnamese patients. The sample size was definitively larger in our study. Two different better-defined criteria were used as indicators of severe disease progression, yet no association was found between disease severity and ACE I/D genotype. The D allele which was the hypothetical high risk allele, did not show any sign of over-representation in the subgroups of patients with severe disease.\nConclusion\nOur analysis indicates that ACE I/D polymorphism is not directly related to poor outcomes after SARS-coronavirus infection in Chinese.\nList of abbreviations used\nACE: angiotensin converting enzyme\nSARS: severe acute respiratory syndrome\nARDS: adult respiratory distress syndrome\nACE I/D polymorphism: angiotensin converting enzyme insertion/deletion polymorphism\nCompeting interests\nYMDL, KCAC, RWKC, SCCC and YKT have filed patent applications on aspects concerning the genomics and detection of the SARS-coronavirus.\nAuthors' contributions\nKCAC, NLST, GTYC, and YMDL have contributed in the preparation of the manuscript and the overall study design.

findings for 50 patients with SARS, representing more than five separate epidemiologically linked transmission clusters.\n\n We defined the clinical presentation and risk factors associated with severe disease and investigated the causal agents by chest radiography and laboratory testing of nasopharyngeal aspirates and sera samples.\n\n We compared the laboratory findings with those submitted for microbiological investigation of other diseases from patients whose identity was masked.\n\n\nFindings\nPatients' age ranged from 23 to 74 years.\n\n Fever, chills, myalgia, and cough were the most frequent complaints.\n\n When compared with chest radiographic changes, respiratory symptoms and auscultatory findings were disproportionally mild.\n\n Patients who were household contacts of

but the pathogenesis is still unclear.\n\n\nMethods\nPost-mortem tissue samples from six patients who died from SARS in February and March, 2003, and an open lung biopsy from one of these patients were studied by histology and virology.\n\n Only one full autopsy was done.\n\n Evidence of infection with the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and human metapneumovirus was sought by reverse-transcriptase PCR and serology.\n\n Pathological samples were examined by light and electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry.\n\n\nFindings\nAll six patients had serological evidence of recent infection with SARS-CoV.\n\n Diffuse alveolar damage was common but not universal.\n\n Morphological changes identified were bronchial epithelial denudation, loss of cilia, and squamous metaplasia.\n\n Secondary bacterial pneumonia was present in one case.\n\n A giant-cell infiltrate was seen in four patients, with a pronounced increase in macrophages in the alveoli and the interstitium of the lung.\n\n Haemophagocytosis was present in two patients.\n\n The alveolar pneumocytes also showed cytomegaly with granular amphophilic cytoplasm.\n\n The patient for whom full

epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).\n\n We assessed the epidemiology of SARS in Hong Kong.\n\n\nMethods\nWe included 1425 cases reported up to April 28, 2003. An integrated database was constructed from several sources containing information on epidemiological, demographic, and clinical variables.\n\n We estimated the key epidemiological distributions: infection to onset, onset to admission, admission to death, and admission to discharge.\n\n We measured associations between the estimated case fatality rate and patientsage and the time from onset to admission.\n\n\nFindings\nAfter the initial phase of exponential growth, the rate of confirmed cases fell to less than 20 per day by April 28. Public-health interventions included encouragement to report to hospital rapidly after the onset of clinical symptoms, contact tracing for confirmed and suspected cases, and quarantining, monitoring, and restricting the travel of contacts.\n\n The mean incubation period of the disease is estimated to be 6.4 days (95% Cl 5.27.7).\n\n The mean time from onset of clinical symptoms to admission to hospital varied between 3 and 5 days, with longer times earlier in the epidemic.\n\n The estimated case fatality rate was 13.2% (9.816.8) for patients younger than 60 years and 43.3% (35.252.4) for patients aged 60 years or older assuming a parametric ? distribution.\n\n A non-parametric method yielded estimates of 6.8% (4.09.6) and 55.0% (45.364.7), respectively.\n\n Case clusters have played an important part in the course of the epidemic.\n\n\nInterpretation\nPatientsage was strongly associated with outcome.\n\n The time between onset of symptoms and admission to hospital did not alter outcome, but shorter intervals will be important to the wider population by restricting the infectious period before patients are placed in quarantine.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7112380","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Christl A","surname":"Donnelly","email":"c.donnelly@imperial.ac.uk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Azra C","surname":"Ghani","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gabriel M","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Anthony J","surname":"Hedley","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Christophe","surname":"Fraser","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Steven","surname":"Riley","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Laith J","surname":"Abu-Raddad","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lai-Ming","surname":"Ho","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Thuan-Quoc","surname":"Thach","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Patsy","surname":"Chau","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"King-Pan","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tai-Hing","surname":"Lam","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lai-Yin","surname":"Tse","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Thomas","surname":"Tsang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shao-Haei","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"James HB","surname":"Kong","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Edith MC","surname":"Lau","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Neil M","surname":"Ferguson","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Roy M","surname":"Anderson","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(03)13412-5","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical progression and viral load in a community outbreak of coronavirus-associated SARS pneumonia: a prospective study","abstract":"Background\nWe investigated the temporal progression of the clinical, radiological, and virological changes in a community outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).\n\n\nMethods\nWe followed up 75 patients for 3 weeks managed with a standard treatment protocol of ribavirin and corticosteroids, and assessed the pattern of clinical disease, viral load, risk factors for poor clinical outcome, and the usefulness of virological diagnostic methods.\n\n\nFindings\nFever and pneumonia initially improved but 64 (85%) patients developed recurrent fever after a mean of 8.9 (SD 3.1) days, 55 (73%) had watery diarrhoea after 7.5 (2.3) days, 60 (80%) had radiological worsening after 7.4 (2.2) days, and respiratory symptoms worsened in 34 (45%) after 8.6 (3.0) days.\n\n In 34 (45%) patients, improvement of initial pulmonary lesions was associated with appearance of new radiological lesions at other sites.\n\n Nine (12%) patients developed spontaneous pneumomediastinum and 15 (20%) developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in week 3.

While increase of HLA-B* 4601 allele frequency was observed in the 'Probable SARS infected' patient group, a further significant increase of the allele was seen in the 'Severe cases' patient group.\n\n These results appeared to indicate association of HLA-B* 4601 with the severity of SARS infection in Asian populations.\n\n Independent studies are needed to test these

We analyzed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS-1), myxovirus resistance-A (MxA), and double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase in 44 Vietnamese SARS patients with 103 controls. The G-allele of non-synonymous A/G SNP in exon 3 of OAS-1 gene showed association with SARS (p = 0.0090). The G-allele in exon 3 of OAS-1 and the one in exon 6 were in strong linkage disequilibrium and both of them were associated with SARS infection. The GG genotype and G-allele of G/T SNP at position -88 in the MxA gene promoter were found more frequently in hypoxemic group than in non-hypoxemic group of SARS (p = 0.0195). Our findings suggest that polymorphisms of two IFN-inducible genes OAS-1 and MxA might affect susceptibility to the disease and progression of SARS at each level.\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a new infectious disease that emerged towards the end of 2002, spreading from China to countries in Asia, Europe, and North America. During the outbreak, a total of 8098 cases of SARS were diagnosed and the mortality rate was 9.6%. Risk factors for exacerbation of the clinical progress in SARS have been reported as being patients in excess of 60 years of age, or having diabetes mellitus or other comorbid medical conditions. However, little is known about host genetic factors associated with the development or progression of SARS, excepting human leukocyte antigens and insertion/deletion polymorphism in the angiotensin converting enzyme 1 gene whose association with the disease our research group had identified.\nIt has been shown that SARS is caused by a newly identified SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Among innate immunity against viral infection, type I interferons (IFN-alpha/beta) induced by virus infection generally play an important role in the first line of defense, inducing intracellular antiviral proteins, such as 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS-1), myxovirus resistance-A (MxA), and double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR). Although the induction of endogenous type I IFNs in the SARS-CoV infection in vivo has not yet been clarified, recent studies have shown that administration of exogenous type I IFNs could inhibit SARS-CoV replication both in vivo and in vitro. Investigations into the role of the IFN system against SARS-CoV infection are important, not only to understand the mechanisms of viral pathogenesis but also to adopt effective therapeutic strategies against SARS.\nHost genetic factors that influence antiviral effects of IFNs have been well studied in the field of viral hepatitis. Type I IFNs have been widely used as antiviral agents, mainly to treat hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Host genetic factors that affect the outcome of IFN treatment in chronic hepatitis C have been investigated, and a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the promoter region of IFN-inducible MxA gene was associated with the response to IFN treatment in the Japanese and Caucasian populations. The SNP in MxA gene and SNPs in OAS-1 gene and in PKR gene were also shown to be associated with self-limiting infection of HCV by Knapp et al.. Their report indicated that the SNPs in IFN-inducible genes were not only associated with the result of IFN treatment but also with the natural course of HCV infection.\nIt has been highly suspected that host genetic factors affect the course of various viral infections, including cases of SARS-CoV infection. In the present study, we have tried to determine whether the polymorphisms in IFN-inducible genes are associated with SARS-CoV infection, development, and progression of SARS. This was carried out by investigating 44 Vietnamese SARS cases, with 103 controls of individuals with a history of contact with SARS patients and 50 controls of individuals with no such contact history.\nMaterials and methods\n Subjects. This study was reviewed and approved by ethics committees in the Ministry of Health in Vietnam as well as the International Medical Center in Japan. Written informed consent had been obtained from all subjects and detailed characteristics of the subjects had been described beforehand. In short, the study population comprised 44 SARS patients in Vietnam, 103 staff members of the same hospital as control subjects, who had come into contact with SARS patients but had not developed SARS, and 50 individuals reflecting the general Vietnamese population, having had no contact history with SARS patients. Out of 44 SARS patients, 22 required oxygen therapy because of hypoxemia, with the other 22 cases, not being hypoxemic, not receiving any such oxygen therapy. There was a significant correlation between the degree of lung involvement in chest radiographs and the requirement of supplementary oxygen. Because of this finding, the progression of SARS in the lung could be reasonably determined from the status of supplementary oxygen ascertained in our previous study. Peripheral blood samples were obtained in all subjects and the genomic DNAs were subsequently extracted. Anti-SARS-CoV antibodies in the blood samples were tested by SARS ELISA (Genelabs Diagnostics, Singapore).\n Genotyping of allelic variants of the OAS-1, MxA, and PKR genes. The SNPs analyzed in this study were all genotyped utilizing PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) methods.\nIt was once held that OAS-1 gene consisted of 8 exons. However, according to the current database of RefSeq gene NM_016816, it comprises six exons. As a result, the A/G SNP (rs#2660) in exon 8 of OAS-1 gene associated with outcome of HCV infection in the previous report by Knapp et al. should have been located in exon 6, which falls on the 3'-untranslated region of long transcript E18 (NM_016816). To detect the SNP, genomic DNA was amplified by AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems) with primers 25AS-e6F (5'-GAG GAC TGG ACC TGC ACC ATC CTC-3') and 25AS-e6R (5'-AGA AAG TCA AGG CTG GAA TTT CAT-3'), and the PCR products of 309 bp were digested with MboII (New England Biolabs) at 37  C for 1 h. The 309 bp product was not cut in the presence of G-allele, but was cut into fragments in the presence of A-allele. Subsequently, the fragment was separated into 188 and 121 bp units on 2% agarose gels with ethidium bromide.\nWe found a non-synonymous SNP in exon 3 of the OAS-1 gene registered in the JSNP database (No. IMS-JST093062, i.e., rs#3741981). The A/G SNP in exon 3 was genotyped by PCR with primers 25AS-e3F (5'-ATC AGG AAT GGA CCT CAA GAC TTC-3') and 25AS-e3R (5'-CGG ATG AGG CTC TTG AGC TTG GT-3'), and RFLP with AciI (New England Biolabs). The PCR products of 306 bp were digested with AciI and electrophoresed on 3% agarose gels to analyze undigested 306 bp band and digested parts of 159 and 147 bp bands.\nThe G/T SNP at position -88 in the promoter region of MxA gene was analyzed by PCR-RFLP methods as described previously. The G/T SNP at position -88 was associated with the result of IFN treatment in chronic hepatitis C and with the result of HCV infection.\nThe T/C SNP at position -168 in the promoter region of PKR gene, associated with result of HCV infection, was genotyped as follows. PCR was carried out with primers PKR-pF (5'-GTG GAA CCC TTG ATT CGA GAA CCT AGT-3') and PKR-pR (5'-GCG GCT TCG GGA GAG CTG GTT CTC AGT-3') using TaKaRa Ex Taq with GC buffer I (TaKaRa). The cycling condition is 45 cycles of 94  C for 15 s, 55  C for 15 s, and 72  C for 1 min. PCR products were purified using QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) and digested with SgrAI (New England Biolabs). Digested DNA was electrophoresed on a 5% agarose gel. The presence of T-allele was demonstrated by 169 and 155 bp fragments, and the presence of C-allele was indicated by 169, 136, and 19 bp fragments.\n Statistical analysis. Possible differences deriving from the distribution of age and gender between two groups were evaluated with the unpaired t test and chi 2 test, respectively. Disease associations were assessed by the chi 2 test. p values less than 0.05 were considered significant in all the tests, and data analysis was carried out using JMP version 5 (SAS Institute). Genotype distribution of tested polymorphisms in the control population was in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. We calculated Lewontin's  D'  and r 2 to assess the extent of pairwise linkage disequilibrium between polymorphisms. These indices were calculated with the use of haplotype frequencies estimated by the PHASE algorithm (PHASE, version 2.1.1) based on Bayesian methods.\nResults\nCharacteristics of SARS cases and healthy contacts\nCharacteristics	Contacts	SARS cases	 		(n = 103)	Anti-SARS-CoV Ab (-) (n = 87)	Anti-SARS-CoV Ab (+) (n = 16)	(n = 44)	Non-hypoxemic group (n = 22)	Hypoxemic group (n = 22)	 	Age (year), mean [range]	36.5 [15-69]	36.6 [15-69]	36.6 [25-50]	39.3 [17-76]	37.7 [17-61]	41.0 [23-76]	 	Male/female (n)	46/57	39/48	7/9	13/31	6/16	7/15	 	\nDemographic information is shown in Table 1 . The mean age was not different between SARS cases and contacts (p  = 0.1781). Although females appeared more frequently in SARS cases than contacts, the male/female ratio was not statistically different between the two groups (p  = 0.0869). Sixteen individuals out of 103 contacts were revealed to have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies. When we classified these individuals into an infected group together with SARS patients, age and gender showed no significant difference between the infected and non-infected groups (p  = 0.2139; 0.2065). SARS cases were classified by the requirement for oxygen therapy. Age and gender did not differ between these subgroups either (p  = 0.4198; 0.7411).\nGenotype and allele frequencies in SARS cases and controls with contact history\n	SARS cases (n = 44)	Controls (n = 103)	p value	 	OAS-1 exon 6	 	 Genotype				 	 AA	18 (40.9%)	60 (58.3%)	0.0537	 	 AG	21 (47.7%)	36 (35.0%)		 	 GG	5 (11.4%)	7 (6.7%)		 	 Allele				 	 A	0.65	0.76	0.0542	 	 G	0.35	0.24		 	 :  : 				 	OAS-1 exon 3	 	 Genotype				 	 AA	9 (20.5%)	42 (40.8%)	0.0178	 	 AG	24 (54.5%)	48 (46.6%)		 	 GG	11 (25.0%)	13 (12.6%)		 	 Allele				 	 A	0.48	0.64	0.0090	 	 G	0.52	0.36		 	 :  : 				 	MxA -88	 	 Genotype				 	 GG	23 (52.3%)	43 (41.7%)	0.2400	 	 GT	16 (36.4%)	52 (50.5%)		 	 TT	5 (11.3%)	8 (7.8%)		 	 Allele				 	 G	0.70	0.67	0.5597	 	 T	0.30	0.33		 	 :  : 				 	PKR -168	 	 Genotype				 	 CC	18 (41.9%)	49 (47.6%)	0.5278	 	 CT	22 (51.2%)	46 (44.7%)		 	 TT	3 (7.0%)	8 (7.8%)		 	 Allele				 	 C	0.67	0.70	0.6780	 	 T	0.33	0.30		 	\nWe analyzed SNPs of IFN-inducible genes showing association with HCV infection as described above, and compared their genotypes and allele frequencies between 44 SARS cases and 103 controls with contact history to SARS patients (Table 2 ).\nWe observed a higher frequency of the G-allele positive genotypes (GA and GG) of non-synonymous SNP in exon 3 of OAS-1 gene in SARS patients (odds ratio 2.68; 95% CI; 1.17-6.15; p  = 0.0178). Allele frequency of the G-allele in exon 3 was significantly higher in SARS patients (p  = 0.0090). Allele frequency of the G-allele in exon 6 of OAS-1 was also found more frequently in SARS patients than in the controls that showed marginal significance (p  = 0.0542).\nGenotype and allele frequencies of OAS-1 polymorphisms in SARS infected, uninfected, and controls without contact history\nOAS-1	SARS infected (n = 60)	Uninfected (n = 87)	p value	Controls without contact (n = 50)	 	Exon 6	 	 Genotype					 	 AA	25 (41.7%)	53 (60.9%)	0.0215	27 (54.0%)	 	 AG	28 (46.7%)	29 (33.3%)		17 (34.0%)	 	 GG	7 (11.7%)	5 (5.7%)		6 (12.0%)	 	 Allele					 	 A	0.65	0.76	0.0176	0.71	 	 G	0.35	0.24		0.29	 	 :  : 					 	Exon 3	 	 Genotype					 	 AA	14 (23.3%)	37 (42.5%)	0.0163	17 (34.0%)	 	 AG	33 (55.0%)	39 (44.8%)		26 (52.0%)	 	 GG	13 (21.7%)	11 (12.6%)		7 (14%)	 	 Allele					 	 A	0.51	0.65	0.0156	0.60	 	 G	0.49	0.35		0.40	 	\nThe genotype and allele frequencies of OAS-1 polymorphisms were compared among 60 SARS-CoV infected individuals and 87 uninfected individuals (Table 3 ). It was shown that frequencies of the G-alleles in exon 3 and exon 6 were significantly higher in infected individuals than in uninfected (p  = 0.0156 and p  = 0.0176, respectively). These two polymorphisms in the OAS-1 gene were in strong linkage disequilibrium ( D'  = 0.931, r 2  = 0.530). Genotype and allele frequencies in 50 controls with no contact history with SARS patients are also shown in Table 3. In controls of subjects having no contact history, allele frequencies of G-allele in exons 3 and 6 were lower than those of the infected group, but higher than those of the uninfected group.\nGenotype and allele frequencies of MxA -88 G/T polymorphism in the subgroups of SARS cases\n	SARS cases (n = 44)	p value	 		Non-hypoxemic group (n = 22)	Hypoxemic group (n = 22)		 	Genotype				 	 GG	8 (36.4%)	15 (68.2%)	0.0346	 	 GT	10 (45.4%)	6 (27.3%)		 	 TT	4 (18.2%)	1 (4.5%)		 	Allele				 	 G	0.59	0.82	0.0195	 	 T	0.41	0.18		 	\nThe SNPs in MxA gene and PKR gene were not associated with the development of SARS (Table 2). However, on comparison of the MxA genotype between hypoxemic SARS patients requiring oxygen therapy and non-hypoxemic SARS patients who did not, GG genotype was found more frequently in patients of the former category (odds ratio 3.75; 95% CI 1.08-10.7; p  = 0.0346). It was also shown that the G-allele was more frequent in the former group (p  = 0.0195) (Table 4 ). The other SNPs did not show any significant p values between these two groups (data not shown).\nDiscussion\nOur study showed that the polymorphisms in the IFN-inducible OAS-1 gene might affect susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection or the development of SARS. In the presence of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), OAS-1 catalyzes the 2',5'-oligomers of adenosine in order to permit the binding and activation of a latent ribonuclease, RNase L, which cleaves cellular and viral RNAs. OAS-1 gene has two major transcripts that are generated by alternative splicing at the last two exons. E16 (NM_002534) is a short transcript with 5 exons and is translated to p40 isoform. E18 (NM_016816) is a long transcript with 6 exons and is translated to p46 isoform. Another transcript 9-2 is generated using a different splice acceptor site that comes from E18 at exon 6 and is translated to 9-2 protein. The 9-2 protein has a unique property due to the Bcl-2 homology domain 3 present in its unique carboxyl-terminal region. This is also distinctive in causing cellular apoptosis by binding to the anti-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family. Therefore, OAS-1 has dual functions representing the synthesis of 2',5'-oligomers of adenosine and the promotion of cellular apoptosis.\nKnapp et al. described how the GG genotype in exon 6 of OAS-1 gene was more frequent in persistent HCV infection than in self-limiting infection. In our study, the G-allele was more frequently observed in SARS-CoV infected individuals than in the uninfected group. In both these studies, the G-allele was susceptible to virus infection. The A/G polymorphism in exon 6 is located downstream of the stop codon for E18 transcript meaning therefore that it is included in the 3'-untranslated region. However, it is located upstream of the stop codon for 9-2, and the A/G SNP results in amino acid substitution Arg397Gly of 9-2 protein, which is located near the Bcl-2 homology domain (amino acid positions 372-393). It will be an interesting aspect if this phenomenon occurs with any functional importance. We also analyzed the A/G polymorphism in exon 3 of OAS-1 gene and found that there was strong linkage disequilibrium between the two SNPs. The A/G polymorphism in exon 3 causes amino acid substitution Ser162Gly in three isoforms, which is located near the dsRNA binding domain (amino acid positions 104-158) of OAS-1. We are unable at this point to determine which SNP is directly related to susceptibility to SARS or SARS-CoV infection. One can also consider that the other unidentified polymorphism of strong linkage disequilibrium with these SNPs may serve as the basis for any functional difference. Judging from the results obtained in this study, polymorphisms in OAS-1 gene are likely to be involved in SARS-CoV infection or the development of SARS, at least in part, bearing in mind the fact that OAS-1 might have antiviral potential against SARS-CoV.\nSARS-CoV is usually cultured in Vero E6 cell line, which cannot produce IFNs because it lacks IFN genes. Recently, Cinatl et al. infected permissive Caco-2 cells with SARS-CoV and analyzed the effects of SARS-CoV on cellular gene expression by high-density oligonucleotide arrays. They found that SARS-CoV infection of Caco-2 cells up-regulated IFN-inducible OAS-2, OASL, and MxA but not PKR genes. OAS-2 and OASL are members of the human OAS gene family. The role of OAS-1 as an inhibitor of SARS-CoV replication should be clarified to examine the hypothesis that Caco-2 cells permitted considerable infection with SARS-CoV because they did not induce OAS-1.\nAs regards the G/T polymorphism at position -88 in promoter region of MxA gene, GG genotype and G-allele were found to be more frequent in patients with an enhanced clinical progression, requiring oxygen therapy, although the number of cases was rather small. GG genotype was found more frequently in non-responders of IFN treatment in hepatitis C, and a luciferase reporter assay revealed that the MxA promoter sequence of G haplotype had lower promoter activity than that of T haplotype. Recently, Arcas et al. reported that GG genotype expressed lower amount of MxA mRNA than GT or TT genotype in IFN-treated peripheral blood mononuclear cells in vitro. Spiegel et al. reported that SARS-CoV replication was not affected in Vero E6 cells that were stably expressing MxA. They concluded that antiviral effect of IFN against SARS-CoV was not mediated by MxA. In our study, -88 SNP in MxA promoter was not related to disease susceptibility. Taking these observations together, MxA may not have a strong inhibitory effect on replication of SARS-CoV, but lower MxA expression may play a role in the worsening of SARS clinical progression.\nIf SARS re-emerges, IFN could be a promising candidate to treat SARS patients. In the present study, the SNPs in OAS-1 were associated with SARS-CoV infection or development of SARS, and the SNP in MxA was associated with the progression of SARS. It could be interesting to consider that they may also be related to the response of SARS patients to IFNs, and that SARS patients with AA genotype of the A/G SNP in exon 3 of OAS-1 may respond to IFN treatment more effectively than those with AG or GG genotypes. During the course of our study, age was not a risk factor contributing to any worsening of SARS, probably because the majority of the patients consisted of relatively young medical staff members.\nIn conclusion, we showed that the polymorphisms in OAS-1 gene were associated with SARS-CoV infection or development of SARS and that the polymorphism in MxA gene was also associated with hypoxemic status in SARS cases in Vietnam. These findings may lead to an understanding of IFN-induced antiviral response to SARS infection.\nReferences\nWorld Health Organization (2003), Consensus document on the epidemiology of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), WHO/CDS/CSR/GAR/2003.11, Geneva\nClinical features and short-term outcomes of 144 patients with SARS in the greater Toronto area\nShort term outcome and risk factors for adverse clinical outcomes in adults with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)\nAssociation of HLA class I with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection\nAssociation of human-leukocyte-antigen class I (B*0703) and class II (DRB1*0301) genotypes with susceptibility and resistance to the development of severe acute respiratory syndrome\nACE1 polymorphism and progression of SARS\nCoronavirus as a possible cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome\nA novel coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome\nIdentification of a novel coronavirus in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome\nNewly discovered coronavirus as the primary cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome\nAntiviral actions of interferons\nPegylated interferon-alpha protects type 1 pneumocytes against SARS coronavirus infection in macaques\nTreatment of SARS with human interferons\nInterferon-beta 1a and SARS coronavirus replication\nThe antiviral effect of interferon-beta against SARS-coronavirus is not mediated by MxA protein\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus is inhibited by interferon-alpha\nInhibition of SARS coronavirus infection in vitro with clinically approved antiviral drugs\nPotent inhibition of SARS-associated coronavirus (SCOV) infection and replication by type I interferons (IFN-alpha/beta) but not by type II interferon (IFN-gamma)\nInterferon-beta and interferon-gamma synergistically inhibit the replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV)\nIdentification of a single nucleotide polymorphism in the MxA gene promoter (G/T at nt -88) correlated with the response of hepatitis C patients to interferon\nSingle nucleotide polymorphism of the MxA gene promoter influences the response to interferon monotherapy in patients with hepatitis C viral infection\nPolymorphisms in interferon-induced genes and the outcome of hepatitis C virus infection: roles of MxA, OAS-1 and PKR\nStructure of two forms of the interferon-induced (2'-5') oligo A synthetase of human cells based on cDNAs and gene sequences\nOn measures of gametic disequilibrium\nThe human 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase family: interferon-induced proteins with unique enzymatic properties\nA specific isozyme of 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase is a dual function proapoptotic protein of the Bcl-2 family\nCloning, sequencing, and expression of two murine 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetases.

countries for infection with SARSCoV, human metapneumovirus, and other respiratory pathogens.\n\n We infected four cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) with SARS-CoV in an attempt to replicate SARS and did necropsies on day 6 after infection.\n\n\nFindings\nSARS-CoV infection was diagnosed in 329 (75%) of 436 patients fitting the case definition of SARS; human metapneumovirus was diagnosed in 41 (12%) of 335, and other respiratory pathogens were diagnosed only sporadically.\n\n SARS-CoV was, therefore, the most likely causal agent of SARS.\n\n The four SARS-CoV-infected macaques excreted SARS-CoV from nose, mouth, and pharynx from 2 days after infection.\n\n Three of four macaques developed diffuse alveolar damage, similar to that in SARS patients, and characterised by epithelial necrosis, serosanguineous exudate, formation of hyaline membranes, type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia, and the presence of syncytia.\n\n SARS-CoV was detected in pneumonic areas by virus isolation and RT-PCR, and was localised to alveolar epithelial cells and syncytia by immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy.\n\n\nInterpretation\nReplication in SARS-CoV-infected macaques of pneumonia similar to that in human beings with SARS, combined with the high prevalence of SARS-CoV infection in SARS patients, fulfill the criteria required to prove that SARS-CoV is the primary cause of SARS.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7112434","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

but the pathogenesis is still unclear.\n\n\nMethods\nPost-mortem tissue samples from six patients who died from SARS in February and March, 2003, and an open lung biopsy from one of these patients were studied by histology and virology.\n\n Only one full autopsy was done.\n\n Evidence of infection with the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and human metapneumovirus was sought by reverse-transcriptase PCR and serology.\n\n Pathological samples were examined by light and electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry.\n\n\nFindings\nAll six patients had serological evidence of recent infection with SARS-CoV.\n\n Diffuse alveolar damage was common but not universal.\n\n Morphological changes identified were bronchial epithelial denudation, loss of cilia, and squamous metaplasia.\n\n Secondary bacterial pneumonia was present in one case.\n\n A giant-cell infiltrate was seen in four patients, with a pronounced increase in macrophages in the alveoli and the interstitium of the lung.\n\n Haemophagocytosis was present in two patients.\n\n The alveolar pneumocytes also showed cytomegaly with granular amphophilic cytoplasm.\n\n The patient for whom full

coronavirus.\n\n Whole genome sequence analysis of various isolates might provide an indication of potential strain differences of this new virus.\n\n Moreover, mutation analysis will help to develop effective vaccines.\n\n\nMethods\nWe sequenced the entire SARS viral genome of cultured isolates from the index case (SIN2500) presenting in Singapore, from three primary contacts (SIN2774, SIN2748, and SIN2677), and one secondary contact (SIN2679).\n\n These sequences were compared with the isolates from Canada (TOR2), Hong Kong (CUHK-W1 and HKU39849), Hanoi (URBANI), Guangzhou (GZ01), and Beijing (BJ01, BJ02, BJ03, BJ04).\n\n\nFindings\nWe identified 129 sequence variations among the 14 isolates, with 16 recurrent variant sequences.\n\n Common variant sequences at four loci define two distinct genotypes of the SARS virus.\n\n One genotype was linked with infections originating in Hotel M in Hong Kong, the second contained isolates from Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and Beijing with no association with Hotel M (p&lt;0.0001).\n\n Moreover, other common sequence variants further distinguished the geographical origins of the isolates, especially between Singapore and Beijing.\n\n\nInterpretation\nDespite the recent onset of the SARS epidemic, genetic signatures are emerging that partition the worldwide SARS viral isolates into groups on the basis of contact source history and geography.\n\n These signatures can be used to trace sources of infection.\n\n In addition, a common variant associated with a non-conservative aminoacid change in the S1 region of the spike protein, suggests that immunological pressures might be starting to influence the evolution of the SARS virus in human populations.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7140172","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

yield of virus.\n When the virulent Purdue strain of TGEV was used, villous atrophy was seen and TGEV antigen was demonstrated immunohistochemically in the villous enterocytes.\n The Miller M6 strain of virus produced less extensive lesions in the segments, but since it was titratable by plaque assay it was used in the subsequent yield reduction assays to determine the antiviral activity of interferon.\n When intestinal segments were inoculated simultaneously with either 3200 units of natural porcine interferon-? or up to 100000 units of recombinant human interferon-?2a, and TGEV, there were no reductions in virus yield, although the same cytokines exerted an antiviral effect in ST cells treated in a similar way.\n However, virus yields were significantly reduced in intestinal segments in piglets treated parenterally with teh synthetic interferon inducer polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid 6 hours before challenge of the segments with TGEV.\n There was also a trend for the antiviral effects of interferon induction before challenge to be augmented by the inclusion of interferon with the virus inoculum.\n It was concluded that interferon would be ineffective as a therapeutic for TGEV, although it might be useful prophylactically.\n","id":"PMC7117254","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Published by Elsevier

Mannose-binding lectin (MBL), a key molecule in innate immunity, functions as an ante-antibody before the specific antibody response. Here, we describe a case-control study that included 569 patients with SARS and 1188 control subjects and used in vitro assays to investigate the role that MBL plays in SARS-CoV infection. The distribution of MBL gene polymorphisms was significantly different between patients with SARS and control subjects, with a higher frequency of haplotypes associated with low or deficient serum levels of MBL in patients with SARS than in control subjects. Serum levels of MBL were also significantly lower in patients with SARS than in control subjects. There was, however, no association between MBL genotypes, which are associated with low or deficient serum levels of MBL, and mortality related to SARS. MBL could bind SARS-CoV in a dose- and calcium-dependent and mannan-inhibitable fashion in vitro, suggesting that binding is through the carbohydrate recognition domains of MBL. Furthermore, deposition of complement C4 on SARS-CoV was enhanced by MBL. Inhibition of the infectivity of SARS-CoV by MBL in fetal rhesus kidney cells (FRhK-4) was also observed. These results suggest that MBL contributes to the first-line host defense against SARS-CoV and that MBL deficiency is a susceptibility factor for acquisition of SARS\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a newly emerged infectious disease of humans, has affected &gt;25 countries, with 8098 cases and 774 deaths reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) during the first half of 2003. The most affected locations were mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, and Toronto, Canada. A novel virus, the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), was identified as the etiological agent and was subsequently confirmed by fulfillment of Koch's postulates. The genome of SARS-CoV is sufficiently different from all previously known coronaviruses to warrant its designation as a new coronavirus group. The surface spike (S) protein is a major target of the host immune response to coronaviruses and plays an important role in the attachment and fusion of the virus to host cells. Postgenomic characterization of SARS-CoV has revealed that the glycosylation of this surface S protein is a high-mannose structure, but knowledge of the pathogenesis of and immune responses to SARS-CoV is still limited\nMannose-binding lectin (MBL) is a key pattern-recognition molecule in innate immunity and functions as an ante-antibody, a humoral factor that plays a critical role in the first-line host defense before the production of antibodies. MBL binds, through its multiple carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs), to repeating arrays of carbohydrate structures on microbial surfaces, thereby activating the complement system via MBL-associated serine protease (MASP)-1 and -2 (also known as &quot;the lectin pathway&quot;) or enhancing phagocytosis by acting as an opsonin. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter and coding regions of the MBL gene (mbl2) have functional effects on serum levels of MBL. MBL deficiency increases the generalized susceptibility of an individual to infectious diseases. Increased susceptibility to infection by specific pathogens:including HIV, Cryptosporidium parvum and Neisseria meningitidis:in MBL-deficient individuals has also been established. MBL has also been shown to opsonize and inhibit the infectivity of influenza A virus \nIn the present study, we examined the role that MBL plays in SARS-CoV infection. Our findings demonstrate that MBL-deficient individuals are more susceptible to SARS. Furthermore, MBL, through its CRDs, could bind SARS-CoV, leading to inhibition of infectivity independent of complement, although activation of complement via the lectin pathway was observed\nPatients, Materials, and Methods\n Patients and samplesApproval for the patient study was granted by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of the Institutional Review Board of The University of Hong Kong/Hospital Authority Hong Kong West Cluster. We included in the study 569 Hong Kong Chinese patients with SARS who were admitted to 5 hospitals in Hong Kong between 10 March and 26 April 2003. These 569 patients represented 59.0% of the total 965 patients with SARS who were admitted to these 5 hospitals during the above period. The male to female ratio was similar between the 569 study patients (249:320) and the whole cohort (410:555), and the mean (SD) age of the study patients (41.2 [17.2] years) was similar to that of the whole cohort (40.7 [17.8] years). The patients fulfilled the modified WHO definition of SARS. Either SARS-CoV antibody seroconversion or detection of SARS-CoV RNA in respiratory secretions by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was documented for at least 95% of the patients. The SARS-CoV antibody and RNA test results were obtained from the Government Virus Unit, Department of Health, Hong Kong Government, and the Department of Microbiology, The University of Hong Kong. The demographic features and outcomes of the patients were obtained from the eSARS database, which is maintained by the Hospital Authority SARS Collaborative Study Group. EDTA whole blood and serum samples:which, after investigations, were archived in the departments of pathology of Pamela Nethersole Youde Hospital, Princess Margaret Hospital, Queen Mary Hospital, and United Christian Hospital:were obtained from the 569 patients with SARS for genotyping and MBL assay\nA population of Hong Kong Chinese comprising 1188 individuals who had either been recruited from the local community or were healthy Red Cross blood donors served as control subjects. Their mean +- SD age was 19.4+-11.6 years; 658 were males, and 530 were females\nDNA was extracted from 200 muL of whole blood by use of the DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen), in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, and was stored at -20 C until further use. Separated serum was frozen at -70 C until further use\n Purification of MBLMBL was purified from ethanol-fractionated human plasma paste (donated by C. Dash, Blood Products Laboratory, Elstree, UK), as described elsewhere. Briefly, MBL was prepared by 2-step mannan-agarose affinity purification, followed by positive removal of trace immunoglobulin impurities. MBL prepared in this manner is noncovalently associated with MASP. In addition, plasma-derived MBL prepared by the State Serum Institute (Copenhagen, Denmark; donated by C. Koch) was also used in some experiments and gave identical results\n Cells and virusThe fetal rhesus kidney cell line (FRhK-4) (American Type Culture Collection) was grown in MEM (Gibco-BRL) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS) (Gibco-BRL), at 37 C in 5% CO2. The SARS-CoV strain used in the present study was HKU39849. The TCID50 of the virus was determined in microtiter plates in accordance with the Reed-Muench method. Briefly, 100 muL of serial 10-fold dilutions of virus were tested in quadruplicate on confluent layers of FRhK-4 cells grown on 96-well tissue-culture plates (Corning-Costar), and any cytopathic effect (CPE) was recorded after 2-3 days\n MBL genotyping and haplotypingThe SNPs in the promoter (-221 X/Y) and exon 1 (codon 54 A/B) of the MBL gene were genotyped by use of 2 separate cycling reactions of the TaqMan allele-discrimination system (Applied Biosystems), as described in our previous study. The MBL mutant allele B is in linkage disequilibrium with the promoter polymorphism X/Y; therefore, B occurs only with Y. To date, no exceptions to this association have been reported, and, accordingly, the data from the 2 separate TaqMan PCR reactions were combined to give 3 haplotypes: YA, YB and XA. Therefore, 6 genotypes were identified in the present study: YA/YA, YA/XA, XA/XA, YA/YB, XA/YB and YB/YB. YB is 1 of 3 mutant haplotypes commonly referred to as &quot;O&quot;. The other 2 known mutant haplotypes carrying structural polymorphisms, C (codon 57) and D (codon 52), were not tested for in the present study, since they are present at an extremely low frequency and probably were absent in the Chinese population. The frequencies of 2-locus haplotypes composed of the promoter and a structural allele were also estimated by performing the haplotype procedure of SAS/Genetic Software (version 8.2; SAS Institute), as described elsewhere; the expectation-maximization algorithm was used to generate maximum-likelihood estimates of haplotype frequencies, given that genetic-marker genotypes are under the assumption of Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE)\n MBL assaySerum levels of MBL were determined by use of an ELISA in which a mouse monoclonal anti-human MBL antibody (HYB 131-01; Antibody Shop), either unlabeled or labeled with biotin, was used as the primary or secondary antibody, respectively, as described elsewhere. Horseradish-peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated streptavidin and substrate solution containing tetramethylbenzidine (R&amp;D) were used for detection of bound secondary antibody, in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions\n Binding of MBL to SARS-CoVNinety-six-well flat-bottom polystryrene plates (Corning-Costar) were coated with either 100 muL (per well) of 103, 104, or 105 TCID50 of SARS-CoV or 1% (wt/vol) bovine serum albumin (BSA) diluted in PBS. After incubation overnight at 4 C, wells were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 1% BSA in PBS containing 0.05% NaN3, were washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS; Gibco-BRL) containing 0.05% Tween 20 (HBSS/tw), and were incubated for 2 h with 100 muL (per well) of 0, 1, 5, or 10 mug/mL MBL diluted in HBSS containing 20 mmol/L CaCl2 (HBSS/Ca2+). In some experiments, wells were incubated with 100 muL of MBL diluted in either HBSS containing 20 mmol/L EDTA or HBSS/Ca2+ containing 2 mg/mL mannan from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sigma-Aldrich). The plates were washed with HBSS/tw and were incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature with 0.2 mug/mL biotinylated monoclonal anti-MBL antibody (HYB 131-01; Antibody Shop) diluted in HBSS/Ca2+ containing 0.2% BSA. Bound antibody was detected by use of HRP-conjugated streptavidin and tetramethylbenzidine substrate solution (R&amp;D), in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The binding of MBL to immobilized SARS-CoV was evaluated by use of absolute absorbance values measured at 450 nm (A450)\n Deposition of complement C4 by the MBL pathway of complement activationNinety-six-well flat-bottom polystryrene plates were coated with either 100 muL (per well) of 105 TCID50 of SARS-CoV or 1% BSA diluted in PBS. After incubation overnight at 4 C, wells were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 1% BSA diluted in PBS containing 0.05% NaN3, were washed 3 times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS/tw), and were incubated with 100 muL (per well) of 0.16, 0.31, 0.625, 1.25, 2.5, or 5 mug/mL MBL diluted in 20 mmol/L Tris-HCl, 10 mmol/L CaCl2, 1 mol/L NaCl, 0.05% (vol/vol) Triton X-100, and 0.1% BSA (pH 7.4). The wells that received no MBL (buffer only) were used as negative controls. After incubation overnight at 4 C, the wells were washed as described above and were incubated for 1.5 h at 37 C with 100 muL (per well) of 4 mug/mL purified human complement component C4 (Quidel) diluted in 4 mmol/L barbital, 145 mmol/L NaCl, 2 mmol/L CaCl2, 1 mmol/L MgCl2, and 1.5 mmol/L NaN3 (pH 7.5). The wells were washed 3 times with PBS/tw, followed by incubation for 1.5 h at room temperature with mouse monoclonal anti-C4 antibody (4 mug/mL; Quidel) diluted in PBS/tw. The wells were washed as described above and were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 100 muL (per well) of HRP-anti-mouse IgG (Dako) diluted 1:1000 in PBS containing 0.2% BSA. The wells were washed and developed with tetramethylbenzidine substrate solution (R&amp;D), as described above. The deposition of complement C4 on SARS-CoV by the MBL pathway was evaluated at A450, according to the following formula: relative percentage of C4 deposition=(A450-A450 of negative controls)/(A450 of negative controls)x100\n Inhibition of the infectivity of SARS-CoV by MBLSARS-CoV (100 TCID50) was treated for 1 h at 37 C with 0, 0.6, 1.3, 2.5, 5, 10, or 20 mug/mL MBL diluted in 100 muL of MEM. Treated virus was added to confluent layers of FRhK-4 cells grown in 96-well plates (Falcon; Becton Dickinson). After 1.5 h of absorption, the wells were washed twice with MEM and incubated with fresh MEM containing 1% FCS. A real-time quantitative PCR specific to the 1b gene region of SARS-CoV, with extraction of viral RNA from the culture supernatant after 24 h of incubation (as described elsewhere), was used to determine the infectivity of SARS-CoV in FRhK-4 cells. In some experiments, the percentage of culture cells producing CPE was determined by light microscopy after 48-60 h of incubation of infected cells; by 48 h, 100% CPE was observed in the cells infected with untreated SARS-CoV (100 TCID50)\n Statistical analysisStatistical analysis was performed by use of SAS software (version 6.12; SAS Institute). Comparisons of sex and MBL genotype distributions between patient and control groups or between subgroups of patients were performed by use of the chi2 test. Age difference between the groups was analyzed by use of an unpaired t test. Serum levels of MBL in any 2 groups were compared by use of the Mann-Whitney U test. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the association between SARS and MBL genotypes, after adjustment for differences in age and sex. Multiple linear regression analysis was also used to investigate factors that may determine serum levels of MBL: MBL genotype, age, sex, and disease status. A significance level of P&lt;.05 was used for all analyses\nResults\n Association between genotypes associated with low serum levels of MBL and SARSDNA from 569 patients with SARS (median [interquartile range {IQR}] age, 41.2 [29-51] years; 249 males and 320 females) and 1188 control subjects (median [IQR] age, 19.4 [10.2-28] years; 658 males and 530 females) was genotyped for MBL promoter (X/Y) and structural (A/B) polymorphisms (table 1). Three MBL haplotypes:YA, XA and YB:were identified, where the mutant allele B is in linkage disequilibrium with the promoter alleles X and Y. The distributions of the haplotypes in patients with SARS and in control subjects were in HWE (P=.518 and P=.778, respectively), and their frequencies were closely matched with that estimated by haplotype analysis (data no shown), in which the estimated frequency of XB was as low as 0.00004 in both SARS patients and control subjects, suggesting that the mutant allele B is very unlikely to occur with the promoter allele X. There was a significant difference between patients with SARS and control subjects in terms of their MBL genotypes (P &lt; .001) (table 1). Genotypes associated with low serum levels of MBL, with the mutant allele B were significantly overrepresented in the patients with SARS. MBL haplotype frequencies also differed between patients with SARS and control subjects, and there was a significantly higher frequency of the haplotype associated with MBL deficiency, YB (P&lt;.001). The overall carriage rate of YB was 33.4% in patients with SARS and 24.7% in control subjects (P&lt;.001; odds ratio [OR], 1.52)\nFrequencies of MBL genotypes and haplotypes in 569 patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and 1188 control subjects\nWe subsequently analyzed carriage of the mutant allele B in patients with SARS who died (n=55) and in those who were discharged from the hospital after recovery (n=514). Carriage of YB did not differ between patients with SARS who recovered and those who died (34.1% [175/514] vs 29.1% [16/55]; P=.56)\n Serum levels of MBL in patients with SARSSerum levels of MBL in 353 patients with SARS, 19-23 days after the onset of disease, were determined. We found that the median serum level of MBL in these patients (0.733 [IQR, 0.263-1.796] mug/mL) was significantly lower than that in 1167 control subjects (1.369 [IQR, 0.572-2.598] mug/mL) (P=.0004); 13 patients with SARS and 63 control subjects had undetectable serum levels of MBL (&lt;0.053 mug/mL). Multiple linear regression analysis further revealed that MBL genotype and age were the significant factors that determined serum levels of MBL. The difference in serum levels of MBL between patients with SARS and control subjects was due to the significantly higher frequencies of genotypes with the mutant allele B which was associated with low serum levels of MBL (figure 1), in the patients with SARS\nSerum levels of mannose-binding lectin (MBL), for MBL genotypes with or without the mutant allele B in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), 19-23 days after the onset of disease. The horizontal bars indicate the medians for each genotype subgroup. Individuals with undetectable serum levels of MBL (&lt;0.053 mug/mL) are not shown\n Binding of MBL to SARS-CoV and complement activation MBL was found to bind to the surface of SARS-CoV-infected FRhK-4 cells as well as to immobilized SARS-CoV, by use of a microtiter capture assay (figures 2 and 3). The binding of MBL to SARS-CoV was calcium dependent and mannan inhibitable, suggesting that MBL, through its CRDs, can bind SARS-CoV. The binding was dose dependent for both MBL and SARS-CoV (figure 3). In addition, MBL was found to enhance deposition of complement C4 on immobilized SARS-CoV, suggesting that MBL activates complement on the virus via the lectin pathway (figure 4)\nBinding of mannose-binding lectin (MBL) to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV)-infected FRhK-4 cells. Binding of MBL to SARS-CoV-infected FRhK-4 cells was observed (A and B). Convalescent serum samples from patients with SARS with confirmed SARS-CoV antibody seroconversion were also tested, and binding of specific IgG to SARS-CoV-infected FRhK-4 cells was detected (C and D). Both MBL and anti-SARS-CoV antibody from serum samples from patients with SARS did not bind uninfected FRhK-4 cells (data not shown). Confocal imaging showed that the binding by MBL mostly occurred on the surface of the infected cell (B) and that the binding by specific IgG from serum samples from patients with SARS occurred on both the surface and in the cytoplasm of the infected cell (D). Original magnifications, x200 (A and C) and x600 (B and D)\nBinding of mannose-binding lectin (MBL) to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV). Binding of MBL to SARS-CoV was determined by use of a microtiter capture assay. Wells of microtiter plates were coated with SARS-CoV, and MBL was incubated for 2 h in the virus-coated wells. A Amount of MBL. Incubation with increasing amounts of MBL resulted in increasing levels of detected MBL bound to immobilized SARS-CoV (Delta). In contrast, MBL binding did not increase when the wells were coated with bovine serum albumin ( ). B Amount of SARS-CoV. The amount of MBL binding was also dependent on the amount of SARS-CoV used to coat the wells. C Presence of Ca2+, EDTA, and/or mannan. To determine the nature of binding of MBL to SARS-CoV, MBL was incubated in wells coated with SARS-CoV in the presence of either Ca2+ or EDTA. The binding of MBL to SARS-CoV was reduced to background levels in the presence of EDTA, indicating that the interaction of MBL with SARS-CoV was Ca2+ dependent. Preincubation of MBL with 2 mg/mL mannan in the presence of Ca2+ also substantially reduced binding of MBL to SARS-CoV. These data provide evidence that MBL bound to immobilized SARS-CoV via its carbohydrate recognition domains. Results are presented as mean +- SE and are representative of 4 experiments\nMannose-binding lectin (MBL)-mediated deposition of complement C4 on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV). Different concentrations of MBL were incubated overnight at 4 C in microtiter plates coated with SARS-CoV. A consistent amount of C4 protein (4 mug/mL) was then incubated for 1.5 h at 37 C in the wells. Incubation with increasing amounts of MBL resulted in increasing deposition of complement C4 on SARS-CoV ( ). In contrast, deposition of complement C4 did not increase when wells were coated with bovine serum albumin ( ). Results are presented as mean +- SE and are representative of 2 experiments\n Inhibition of the infectivity of SARS-CoV by MBLWe further investigated the possible translation of binding of MBL to inhibition of the infectivity of SARS-CoV. SARS-CoV (100 TCID50) preincubated in serum-free medium containing MBL at different concentrations (0.6-20 mug/mL) was added to confluent layers of FRhK-4 cells. After 24 h of incubation, the infectivity of SARS was determined by use of a real-time quantitative PCR specific to the 1b gene region of SARS-CoV, with extraction of viral RNA from the culture supernatant. MBL was found to have an inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV infection, in a dose-dependent fashion (figure 5). Such inhibition was also observed in separate experiments that determined CPE in culture cells after 48-60 h of incubation; &gt;75% inhibition of CPE was observed when SARS-CoV was pretreated with 5 or 10 mug/mL MBL, whereas partial inhibition of CPE (25%-50%) was observed when SARS-CoV was pretreated with 1.25 or 2.5 mug/mL MBL. No inhibition of CPE (i.e., 100% cells producing CPE) was found when SARS-CoV was pretreated with 0.6 mug/mL MBL, a concentration similar to the median serum level (0.52 mug/mL) in healthy individuals with group II MBL genotypes (e.g., MBL B carriers)\nInhibition of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) infection. SARS-CoV pretreated with different concentrations of mannose-binding lectin (MBL) was added to confluent layers of FRhK-4 cells. After 1.5 h of absorption, the cells were washed and incubated with fresh medium. The infectivity of SARS-CoV was determined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction specific to the 1b gene region of SARS-CoV, with extraction of viral RNA from the culture supernatant after 24 h of incubation. Increasing amounts of MBL resulted in decreasing the infectivity of SARS-CoV. Results are representative of 4 experiments\nDiscussion\nIn the present study, we have shown that individuals either heterozygous or homozygous for YB had an OR of 1.52 for acquisition of SARS, and the frequency of YB was significantly higher in patients with SARS than in control subjects. Increasing ORs (1.53, 1.81, and 2.21) were indeed observed in the individuals with genotypes carrying 1 mutant haplotype (YB) with a haplotype associated with high serum levels of MBL (YA) 1 mutant haplotype (YB) with a haplotype associated with low serum levels of MBL (XA), and 2 mutant haplotypes (YB) (i.e., YA/YB, XA/YB and YB/YB respectively). Since YB is associated with low serum levels of MBL, we further established that patients with SARS had serum levels of MBL that were significantly lower than those in control subjects. We conclude, therefore, that low serum level of MBL is a susceptibility factor for acquisition of SARS; this conclusion further supports the role of MBL as a first line of defense in respiratory infections, as has been documented in many other clinical settings. For example, polymorphisms associated with low serum levels of MBL have been associated with frequency of respiratory tract infections in children, higher risk of invasive pneumococcal disease, greater mortality and impaired lung function related to cystic fibrosis, and more-frequent hospital admissions with respiratory tract infections related to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Nevertheless, in the present study, XA (low-expression promoter) was not associated with susceptibility to SARS, possibly because the serum level of MBL in XA carriers was higher than that in YB carriers and was already sufficient to avert infection with SARS\nWe also examined whether YB was associated with a greater risk of death in patients with SARS. The carriage of YB however, did not differ between patients with SARS who died and patients with SARS who recovered. This lack of difference is likely due to the small number of the former who were tested; risk factors may not be easily detected in these patients, in particular in those with small effect size. It is also possible that, once an infection is established, many other factors contribute to the interaction between infectious agents and host defenses\nWe attempted to investigate the role that MASP-2 plays in SARS-CoV infection, because MBL complexes with MASP-2 efficiently activate complement. A structural polymorphism (allele A or G in exon 3 of the MASP-2 gene) that was recently found in the region encoding either a normal or a mutant form of the MASP-2 first domain CUB1 was also genotyped in patients with SARS and control subjects (data no shown). However, we did not find the mutant allele G which suggests that this allele, which is present in the Danish population at a gene frequency of 5%, is extremely rare in the Chinese population. Further experiments will be required to establish whether MASP-2 contributes to the immune response to SARS-CoV infection\nTo elucidate the mechanisms underlying how MBL affects SARS-CoV infection, we investigated and demonstrated binding of and inhibition of the infectivity of SARS-CoV by MBL. MBL has been shown to function as an opsonin for other respiratory viruses, such as influenza A virus, and to inhibit hemagglutination and the infectivity of several strains of influenza A virus. MBL inhibits hemagglutination and neutralizes the infectivity of influenza A virus by binding to the N-linked high-mannose carbohydrate side chain at the tip of the hemagglutinin S, thereby blocking the access of cell-surface receptors to the receptor-binding site on hemagglutinin. Similarly, the S protein of SARS-CoV has 23 potential N-linked glycosylation sites, and some of the sites are glycosylated with high-mannose structures. MBL selectively binds to mannose, glucose, l-fucose, n-acetylmannosamine, and n-acetylglucosamine, whereas galactose is not bound. Since the binding of MBL to SARS-CoV could be inhibited by mannan and since this binding was Ca2+ dependent, it is likely that the binding of MBL to SARS-CoV is through the interaction of the CRDs of the MBL with the mannose side chains of the S protein of SARS-CoV\nIn vitro inhibition of the infectivity of SARS-CoV by MBL was achieved at physiological levels. Since MBL may mediate complement activation, as demonstrated by our assay for in vitro deposition of complement C4, and modulate phagocytosis of SARS-CoV by macrophages, resulting in other antiviral responses, the effect of MBL on SARS-CoV in vivo may be more complex. Further experiments to delineate the relative roles between MBL, complement, and macrophages, in control of SARS-CoV infection, are required\nAccumulating evidence has shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a metallopeptidase, is a functional receptor for SARS-CoV that can bind to the S1 domain of the S protein of SARS-CoV. Anti-ACE2 antibody can block viral replication in African green monkey kidney cells (Vero E6). Furthermore, a recombinant human antibody against the S1 domain of the S protein of SARS-CoV has been shown to neutralize the virus on Vero E6 cells and inhibit formation of syncytia between cells expressing the S protein and those expressing ACE2. MBL is a serum C-type lectin, and, here, we have demonstrated that MBL binds SARS-CoV per se or infected cells and inhibits the infectivity of the virus on rhesus monkey kidney cells. These findings therefore support the possible role of MBL in the host defense against SARS-CoV infection by targeting the S protein of SARS-CoV before production of specific antibody. Taken together, our findings suggest that MBL-deficient individuals are more susceptible to SARS, and they provide insight into the possible mechanisms of the innate immune response to SARS-CoV infection. It will be important to assess the therapeutic and prophylactic effect of replenishment of MBL in MBL knock-out animal models of SARS\nFinancial support: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
