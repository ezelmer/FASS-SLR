This study investigated 14 respiratory viruses in ARIs among children and associated meteorological factors in Shantou, southern China.\nMethods\nPaired nasal/throat-flocked swabs collected from 1,074 children with ARIs, who visited outpatient walk-in clinics in a tertiary hospital between December 2010 and November 2011, were examined for fourteen respiratory viruses - influenza viruses (FluA, FluB), respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV A and B), human coronaviruses (hCoV: 229E, OC43, HKU1, NL63), human metapneumoviruses (hMPV A and B), parainfluenza viruses (PIV1-4), human rhinoviruses (HRV A, B, C), enteroviruses (EV), adenoviruses (ADV), human bocavirus (hBoV), and human parechoviruses (hPeV) - by multiplex real-time PCR.\nResults\nWe identified at least one virus in 82.3% (884/1,074) and multiple viruses in 38.6% (415/1,074) of patients.

Overlapping seasonal trends of viruses were recorded over the year, with dual peaks for EV and single peaks for the others. By logistic regression analysis, EV was positively associated with the average temperature and humidity, hCoV, and PIV4, but negatively with HRV, PIV3, and hBoV. HRV was inversely associated with EV and PIV3.\nConclusions\nThis study reports high viral detection and co-detection rates in pediatric ARI cases mainly due to EV and HRV. Many viruses circulated throughout the year with similar seasonal trends in association with temperature, humidity, and wind velocity. Statistically significant associations were present among the viruses. Understanding the polyviral etiology and viral interactions in the cases with multiple viruses warrants further studies.\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12879-015-0863-6) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\nBackground\nAcute respiratory infections (ARIs) are one of the illnesses of highest morbidity and mortality in children worldwide. The pathogens causing ARIs vary geographically and by season, but globally viruses play a major role. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is by far the most common pathogen associated with severe respiratory diseases as bronchiolitis, exacerbation of asthma, or pneumonia in early life, and is a leading cause of hospitalization in children under two. Influenza viruses have the greatest potential to cause severe respiratory diseases in the very young, the elderly and those with underlying chronic conditions. Enteroviruses including human rhinoviruses (HRV) and human enteroviruses (EV), previously identified in childhood upper respiratory tract infections, are commonly associated with milder ARIs and have been suspected as major etiological agents of lower respiratory tract infections leading to bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infants. It has also been reported that human metapneumovirus (hMPV) causes approximately 5-10% of all ARIs in children and adults and adenoviruses (ADV) account for 5-15% of respiratory infections in children. Respiratory illnesses can be attributable to other viruses such as parainfluenza viruses (PIV) and human coronaviruses hCoV-229E, OC43. With rapid progress in molecular diagnostics, newly discovered viruses including human bocavirus (hBoV), human coronaviruses (hCoV-NL63, hCoV-HKU1), human parechoviruses (hPeV), and polyomaviruses WU (WUPyV) and KI (KIPyV) have also been detected in children with respiratory infections, with varying levels of proof of causation.\nHospital-based studies in children published over the last decade worldwide have identified viruses in up to 95% of ARI episodes, with a single virus found in 40-60% and multiple viruses in 1-40% of infected patients. Co-infection is reportedly related to the time of year when circulations of multiple viruses occur. Some studies have shown that the prevalence of co-infections is not related to the absolute prevalence of individual viruses. Factors such as young age, male gender, and history of immunosuppression are associated with an increased chance of viral co-infections. There could be likely interactions between climatic, environmental, and behavioral factors, and complex interplay between circulating viruses and population-level immunity regarding viral co-infections. Understanding these factors may help us prevent transmission of these infections.\nRecent etiologic studies on pediatric respiratory infections mostly report the prevalence in hospitalized children and the seasonality of viruses without elaborating viral co-infection. Therefore, the significance of the detection of multiple viral pathogens in ARIs is unclear. Here, we investigated fourteen common respiratory viruses among pediatric outpatients in southern China during 2010-2011 and their associations with meteorological factors.\nMethods\nStudy location\nThis study was conducted at the Pediatric Outpatient Walk-in Clinics, the First Affiliated Hospital of Shantou University Medical College. The Pediatric Department provides both primary and tertiary care (common practice in China) for approximately 35,000 children per year in the Chaoshan region of southern China. The Chaoshan region is in the subtropical zone with an average annual temperature of 21.3 C and excellent to lightly polluted air quality levels (air quality index, AQI: 17-142, in 2012-2013).\nStudy design\n\nDemographic and clinical characteristics, and virus positivity of pediatric outpatients with acute respiratory infections (n = 1,074)\n\nParameter	Patients with an ARI	Virus-negative cases	Virus-positive cases	OR (95% CI)	p valuef	 	Total (n = 1,074)	Total (n = 190)	Total (n = 884)	OR (95% CI)	p valuee	Single virus (n = 469)	Multiple viruses (n = 415)	 	Gender	 	Male	669 (62.3)	107 (56.3)	562 (63.6)	Reference	-	293 (62.5)	269 (64.8)	Reference	-	 	Female	405 (37.7)	83 (43.7)	322 (36.4)	0.7 (0.5-1.0)	0.06	176 (37.5)	146 (35.2)	0.9 (0.7-1.2)	0.47	 	Age group (year)	 	&lt;=1 (infant)	225 (20.9)	41 (21.6)	184 (20.8)	Reference	-	103 (22.0)	81 (19.5)	Reference	-	 	&gt;1 -2 (toddler)	201 (18.7)	31 (16.3)	170 (19.2)	1.2 (0.7-2.0)	0.44	86 (18.3)	84 (20.2)	1.2 (0.8-1.9)	0.31	 	&gt;2-5 (preschool child)	468 (43.6)	86 (45.3)	382 (43.2)	1.0 (0.7-1.5)	1.00	206 (43.9)	176 (42.4)	1.1 (0.8-1.5)	0.65	 	&gt;5-16 (school child)	180 (16.8)	32 (16.8)	148 (16.7)	1.0 (0.6-1.7)	0.92	74 (15.8)	74 (17.8)	1.3 (0.8-2.0)	0.28	 	Clinical presentationa	 	Cough	894 (83.2)	161 (84.7)	733 (82.9)	0.9 (0.6-1.3)	0.54	384 (81.9)	349 (84.1)	1.2 (0.8-1.7)	0.38	 	Rhinorrhea	666 (62.0)	117 (61.6)	549 (62.1)	1.0 (0.7-1.4)	0.89	273 (58.2)	276 (66.5)	1.4 (1.1-1.9)	&lt;0.05	 	Fever of &gt;38 Cb	359 (33.4)	75 (39.5)	284 (32.1)	0.7 (0.5-1.0)	0.05	138 (29.4)	146 (35.2)	1.3 (1.0-1.7)	0.08	 	Nasal congestion	157 (14.6)	36 (18.9)	121 (13.7)	0.7 (0.5-1.0)	0.06	65 (13.9)	56 (13.5)	1.0 (0.7-1.4)	0.89	 	Sneezing	109 (10.1)	22 (11.6)	87 (9.8)	0.8 (0.5-1.4)	0.47	48 (10.2)	39 (9.4)	0.9 (0.6-1.4)	0.68	 	Sore throat	99 (9.2)	19 (10.0)	80 (9.0)	0.9 (0.5-1.5)	0.68	43 (9.2)	37 (8.9)	1.0 (0.6-1.5)	0.89	 	Othersc	57 (5.3)	14 (7.4)	43 (4.9)	0.6 (0.3-1.2)	0.16	23 (4.9)	20 (4.8)	1.0 (0.5-1.8)	1.00	 	Socio-medical informationa	 	ARI history in 4 weeks	472 (43.9)	90 (47.4)	382 (43.2)	0.8 (0.6-1.2)	0.29	193 (41.2)	189 (45.5)	1.2 (0.9-1.6)	0.19	 	Passive smoking	605 (56.3)	103 (54.2)	502 (56.8)	1.1 (0.8-1.5)	0.52	275 (58.6)	227 (54.7)	0.9 (0.7-1.1)	0.24	 	Family size (person, n = 1,072)d	 	&lt;=3	287 (26.8)	44 (23.3)	243 (27.5)	Reference	-	117 (25.0)	126 (30.4)	Reference	-	 	4-15	785 (73.2)	145 (76.7)	640 (72.5)	0.8 (0.6-1.2)	0.23	351 (75.0)	289 (69.6)	0.8 (0.6-1.0)	0.08	 	\nData are presented as number (%).

Patients with any condition preventing swab collection were excluded. We recruited eligible patients in the morning, during which approximately 70% of patient visits are made, on a daily basis except public holidays from December 2010 to November 2011. Participants' demographic details and clinical features are shown in Table 1. Paired nose and throat-flocked swabs (Copan, Brescia, Italy, Cat. no. 503CS01 and 502CS01) were collected from each participant, combined in one tube, and stored within 3 h of collection at -80 C until further processing.\nLaboratory procedure\nMultiplex real-time PCR was performed using Roche, Lightcycler 480 II (Roche Diagnostics, Penzberg, Germany) to identify the following 14 respiratory viruses: influenza A (FluA), influenza B (FluB), respiratory syncytial viruses A and B (RSV), human coronaviruses 229E, OC43, HKU1 and NL63 (hCoV), human metapneumoviruses A and B (hMPV), human parainfluenza virus types 1, 2 , 3, and 4 (PIV1, PIV2, PIV3, and PIV4), human rhinoviruses A, B, and C (HRV), human enteroviruses (EV), human adenoviruses (ADV), human bocavirus (hBoV), and human parechoviruses (hPeV).\nNucleic acid extraction was performed using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany, Cat. no. 52906). Reverse transcription and Real-time PCR assays were performed as described previously, except for the primers and/or probes for HRV, hPeV, and internal control equine arteritis virus (EAV, see the sequences of 14 viruses in Additional file 1). Due to known cross-reactivity between enteroviruses, HRV was detected using two sets of primers and probes: HRV-v1 (version 1) for screening and HRV-v2 (version 2) for confirmation. Real-time PCR results were interpreted as described previously. The PCR was considered positive or negative when the Cp value was less than 40 cycles or exceeded 40 cycles, respectively, and the positive control showed the expected Cp value, negative control was negative, and internal control showed the expected Cp value. A negative internal control signal was accepted in case of a positive target sequence with correct positive and negative control signals.\nMeteorological data\nMeteorological data, including the average daily temperature ( C), the average daily humidity (%), and the average daily wind velocity (km/h), were collected from the official website of Shantou Meteorology, TuTiempo.net (http://www.tutiempo.net/en/Climate/Shantou/2011/593160.htm).\nStatistical analysis\nWe used Chi-square test to compare differences in the distribution of categorical variables, ANOVA and Kruskall Wallis tests to compare medians, and the Pearson correlation analysis to evaluate the associations between the meteorological factors and viruses and among viruses. The variables with significant associations were further analyzed in multivariate logistic regression models, in which symptoms and positivity of viruses were treated as dependent and independent variables to assess virus-symptom associations; and individual viruses were treated as dependent variables with meteorological factors or other viruses as independent variables to investigate meteorological factor-virus and virus-virus associations. A two-tailed p-Value of &lt;0.05 was considered significant. All these analyses were performed with SPSS Statistics version 17.0.\nEthics\nThe study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Shantou University Medical College and the Oxford University Tropical Research Ethical Committee (OxTREC).

At least one virus was identified in 82.3% (884/1,074) of the patients, with single virus in 43.7% (469/1,074) and multiple viruses in 38.6% (415/1,074). hPeV was not detected. Compared with virus-negative patients, virus-positive patients were less likely to have fever (OR: 0.7, 95% CI: 0.5-1.0, p = 0.05). Patients with multiple viruses were more likely to have rhinorrhea than those with single virus (OR: 1.4, 95% CI: 1.1-1.9, p &lt; 0.05, Table 1). hCoV (OR: 1.6, 95% CI: 1.0-2.4) and PIV4 (OR: 1.6, 95% CI: 1.0-2.4) were more prevalent in the &gt;5 year age group than in the &lt;=5 year group (all p &lt;= 0.05), while hBoV (OR: 0.3, 95% CI: 0.1-0.7) and RSV (OR: 0.4, 95% CI: 0.2-1.0) were less frequently found in the &gt;5 year group (all p &lt; 0.05). Chi-square test and multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that cough was positively associated with HRV and RSV, and negatively with EV; rhinorrhea was positively associated with HRV, PIV3, and hBoV, and negatively with EV; fever was positively associated with EV, and negatively with HRV and PIV3; and nasal congestion was positively associated with RSV, and negatively with EV and hCoV (all p &lt; 0.05, Table 2).\n\nDetection of viruses from nasal/throat swabs of pediatric outpatients with acute respiratory infections, ARIs (n = 884)\n\nPositive for	Total (n = 884)	EV (n = 374)	HRV (n = 353)	hCoV (n = 155)	PIV3 (n = 145)	PIV4 (n = 132)	hBoV (n = 78)	RSV (n = 75)	FluA (n = 58)	FluB (n = 54)	PIV2 (n = 40)	PIV1 (n = 22)	ADV (n = 19)	hMPV (n = 3)	 	Single virus	469 (53.1)	170 (36.2)	161 (34.3)	16 (3.4)	41 (8.7)	10 (2.1)	24 (5.1)	6 (1.3)	6 (1.3)	22 (4.7)	5 (1.1)	3 (0.6)	4 (0.9)	1 (0.2)	 	Multiple viruses	415 (46.9)	204 (49.2)	192 (46.3)	139 (33.5)	104 (25.1)	122 (29.4)	54 (13.0)	69 (16.6)	52 (12.5)	32 (7.7)	35 (8.4)	19 (4.6)	15 (3.6)	2 (0.5)	 	2 viruses	265 (30.0)	132	122	51	56	44	31	27	22	18	9	12	5	1	 	3 viruses	111 (12.6)	53	51	62	31	52	16	18	12	10	15	5	7	1	 	4 viruses	27 (3.1)	10	17	15	11	14	7	12	9	3	5	2	3	0	 	5 viruses	5 (0.6)	4	0	4	3	5	0	5	4	0	0	0	0	0	 	6 viruses	6 (0.7)	4	2	6	2	6	0	6	5	0	5	0	0	0	 	7 viruses	1 (0.1)	1	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	 	\nData are presented as number (%).\n\nAbbreviations: EV, enterovirus; HRV, human rhinovirus; hCoV, human coronavirus; PIV1-4, parainfluenza 1-4; hBoV, human bocavirus; RSV, respiratory syncytial virus; FluA, influenza A; FluB, influenza B; ADV, adenovirus; hMPV, human metapneumovirus.\nViruses detected alone or co-detected with other viruses are shown in Table 3. The most frequently detected virus was EV (42.3%, 374/884), followed by HRV (39.9%, 353/884), and hCoV (17.5%, 155/884).

EV was positively associated with the average temperature and humidity and the presence of hCoV and PIV4, but negatively with HRV, PIV3, and hBoV. HRV was negatively associated with the presence of EV and PIV3. hCoV was positively associated with the average temperature and humidity and the presence of EV and PIV4. PIV3 was positively associated with the average humidity and the presence of RSV and FluA, but negatively with the average temperature and wind velocity, and the presence of EV, HRV, and hBoV. PIV4 was positively associated with the average temperature and the presence of hCoV and RSV, however, negatively with the wind velocity. hBoV was positively associated with RSV and FluA, but negatively with the average temperature and humidity and the presence of EV and PIV3. RSV was positively associated with the presence of PIV3-4, hBoV, and FluA, but negatively with the average temperature and wind velocity. FluA was positively associated with the presence of PIV3-4, hBoV, and RSV, but negatively with the average temperature.\nDiscussion\nThis is the first prospective study reporting the associations between meteorological parameters and co-circulation patterns of 14 common respiratory viruses. The viral detection rate among pediatric outpatients with ARIs in this study (82.3%, 884/1,074) was higher than those reported from Nanjing, China (16 viruses, 50.6%, 248/490) and other countries, including Honduras (16 viruses, 75.4%, 260/345) and Greece (17 viruses, 70.0%, 428/611) in the same study period. Enteroviruses (EV, 34.8% and HRV, 32.9%) were most frequently detected in our outpatient children. Influenza viruses and RSV, the leading pathogens in pediatric outpatients in similar studies, were detected in 10.4% and 7.0% of our cases, with hCoVs (229E, OC43, HKU1, and NL63) in 14.4%, and relatively recently discovered viral pathogens hBoV and hMPV in 7.3% and 0.3% of cases, respectively (Table 3).\nThe viral co-detection rate (38.6%, 415/1,074) was also high among our study population. Reported rates of co-detection vary widely, from 6.1% among pediatric patients with influenza-like illness to 62% among infants with acute bronchiolitis. Detection of dual viruses is common, and co-detection of five or even six viruses is not anecdotal. All the cases with 5-7 viruses in this study were in May, the end of the cold season in the Chaoshan region. This may be in part due to past viral infections, as some viruses can still be detectable by PCR several weeks after infection. Most studies have shown that RSV is the predominant respiratory pathogen co-detected in hospitalized children, followed by HRV, PIV, hMPV, hBoV, and FluA. In this study, EV, HRV, hCoV, and PIV 3-4 were involved in the majority of co-detections, with EV-HRV as the most frequently co-detected pair (23% of co-detections). EV and HRV were included in the panels in many studies globally, and the EV-HRV pair was the most commonly detected pair among outpatient children with ARIs in Finland (19.6% of co-detections) and infants with acute bronchiolitis in Brazil. The co-detection rate of EV-HRV in this study is similar to that in Finland.\nVarying detection rates of multiple viruses in different studies may reflect the differences in the study period and location, study population, environmental factors, the number of respiratory pathogens tested, and/or the diagnostic methods/techniques used. Likely reasons behind high detection rates of single and multiple viruses in this study could be due to improved recovery of viruses by using flocked swabs and/or combined nasal and throat swabs.\nThere are advantages and disadvantages of multiplex PCR technique in diagnosing respiratory viral infections. While its high sensitivity and specificity facilitate simultaneous detection of a large spectrum of viruses, including those difficult to be identified by traditional methods, its capacity to detect low amounts of viral nucleic acids in some cases during viral incubation period, asymptomatic infection, or post-infectious shedding makes it difficult to interpret the results. The development and validation of standardized quantitative PCR with clinically relevant cutoff values or combining qPCR with serology could be helpful for etiologic understanding of simultaneous presence of multiple viruses.\nCertain host-specific risk factors may predispose a child to respiratory co-infection. Younger age, male gender, and history of immunosuppression are associated with increased risk of viral co-detections. Nonetheless, similar associations were not found in this study.\nMeteorological factors vs. viral detections\nViral co-detection is not random; clear associations for certain viral co-occurrence have been described. The viruses circulating at the same time of a year are more likely to accompany each other. This may be driven by meteorological factors which actually work behind seasonal variations, or by interactions of certain coexisting viruses. Temperature, humidity, and wind velocity are the most commonly studied factors significantly associated with the overall number of ARI hospitalizations and the prevalence of various respiratory viruses.\nTemperature\nThe average temperature is the key climatic parameter associated with the prevalence of many respiratory viruses. Some viruses survive and/or replicate better at low temperatures, having peak prevalence in the colder months. In our study, the detection rates of PIV3, RSV, FluA, and ADV were negatively associated with temperature and were highest at temperatures between 5 C and 15 C (Tables 4 and 5), supporting the notion that low temperature is suitable for the survival of lipid-enveloped air-borne viruses. Low temperatures have been found to favor RSV in southeast China, Malaysia, Nepal, Brazil and Germany, influenza in Japan and Germany, and ADV in Germany; however, high temperatures favored PIV3 in southeast China and Nepal, RSV in Singapore, Hong Kong, and Indonesia, and ADV in southeast China. No association between temperature and FluA activity was found in Nepal and Brazil. In our study, other viruses such as EV, hCoV, and PIV4 were more often detected during months with higher temperatures, having peaks at temperatures between 15 C and 35 C (Tables 4 and 5). In contrast to our findings, hCoV was negatively associated with temperature, and no association between EV and temperature was found among children with ARIs in Germany.\nHumidity\nAssociation of humidity and viral detection rates has been reported from Germany, Singapore, Hong Kong, Brisbane, and Vancouver. In this study, three viruses (EV, hCoV, and PIV3) were positively associated with the average humidity (Table 5). The optimal average humidity ranges for EV and hCoV were 70-99% and 80-99% respectively, supporting a previous finding that high average humidity (80%) had a protective effect on the survival of hCoV. Our findings on PIV3 are inconsistent with animal and laboratory observations that lipid-enveloped viruses such as PIV survived better in cooler, less humid environment. hBoV was negatively associated with the average humidity, and its optimal humidity was 30-69% (Tables 4 and 5). No climatic data is available for comparison regarding this virus. Previously reported association between FluA and the average humidity was not found in our study.\nWind velocity\nPIV1 and PIV3 have been reported to be negatively associated with wind velocity. In low wind speed environment, viruses can easily colonize in the epithelium of upper respiratory tract. An increased wind velocity is correlated with RSV activity in Germany. In our study, PIV3, PIV4, and RSV were inversely associated with the wind velocity. Although we observed higher rates of EV and FluB but lower rate of HRV in low wind velocity, we could not confirm these associations by logistic regression analysis.\nThe underlying reasons for the observed associations between virus circulations and meteorological factors are unclear. Climate could have a direct or indirect effect on viral survival, transmission efficiency, host immunity, and social behavior change. Cold and dry conditions might favor the transmission of viruses, and cold or rainy days could decrease outdoor activities of children and increase the probabilities of close contact and transmission of infections. Holidays (supported by our data with less cases in February as Chinese new year and July-August summer holiday, Figure 2 and Additional file 3), could also play a role in an annual epidemic cycle. It is likely that several factors interact in complex ways in the development of observed epidemics under optimal climatic conditions and that the contributions of individual factors vary for different viruses. Further investigations such as time series model over many years are needed to account for their inherent autocorrelations, and thus the observed associations between meteorological parameters and viruses in this exploratory analysis should be interpreted with caution.\nVirus-virus association\nViral co-detection patterns may be the reflection of interactions between viruses. Co-detection of viruses has been frequently reported. Here, we have assured their associations by mathematical models (Table 5). We identified many pairs of viruses with positive associations, including EV-hCoV, hCoV-PIV4, PIV3-RSV, PIV3-FluA, PIV4-RSV, hBoV-RSV, hBoV-FluA, and RSV-FluA. Negative associations for EV-HRV, EV-PIV3, EV-hBoV, HRV-PIV3, and PIV3-hBoV were also found in this study.\nCross-reactivity of HRV primers with EV\nBoth belonging to the enteroviruses genus, HRV and EV have similarities in the highly conserved sequence of the 5' noncoding region, which is the preferred site for molecular assay development. Cross-reactivity between the primers of HRV with EVs has been reported and is among others attributable to EV-D68, an emerging pathogen frequently undetected and misdiagnosed as HRV. Confirmation of cross-reacting EV types in this geographic region should be done in future studies.\nClinical significance of viral positivity\nThere is no consensus in the literature on the clinical implications of the viral detection and co-detection. Some studies linked multiple viral detections with fever, or increased hospitalization and intensive care admission, while others described a very similar prognosis as in single infection, or even milder presentations. In this study, the virus-negative patients had fever more often, which may be caused by other pathogens such as bacteria. We also found that rhinorrhea was more frequently present in patients with multiple viruses than in those with a single virus, and some viruses were more (or less) likely to exist in certain age groups or were accompanied with certain symptoms. Since we did not follow the cases, the associated clinical course and outcome (such as hospitalization) remain unknown. A better understanding on the clinical courses of single and multiple viral etiologies requires further studies.\nThe current study has several limitations. The majority of outpatients enrolled in this study were mild and moderate cases. Therefore, we could have missed pathogens responsible for severe ARIs. As healthy or asymptomatic controls were not included, their viral carriage burdens and the actual role of virus infections could not be elucidated. Following up the cases for clinical burdens and serologic testing would be required in future studies. Air quality indicators such as Ozone and PM2.5, which might influence the host's susceptibility or virus circulation, should be included to investigate meteorological factors.\nConclusions\nIn summary, this study reports a high viral carriage in pediatric ARI cases with high viral co-detection rates mainly due to EV and HRV. There were overlapping seasonal trends of many viruses throughout the year. Meteorological factors, including temperature, humidity, and wind velocity, were associated with the viral detection rates. Statistically significant associations were present among the viruses. Further studies are needed to address polyviral etiology and viral interaction in multiple virus positive cases.\nAdditional files\nAbbreviations\nARIs\nAcute respiratory infections\nFluA\nInfluenza A\nFluB\nInfluenza B\nRSV\nRespiratory syncytial virus\nhCoV\nHuman coronavirus\nhMPV\nHuman metapneumovirus\nPIV\nParainfluenza virus\nHRV\nHuman rhinovirus\nEV\nEnteroviruses\nADV\nAdenoviruses\nhBoV\nHuman bocavirus\nhPeV\nHuman parechoviruses\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nBLC and HP designed and performed the experiments, analyzed the data, and wrote the paper.

hospitalized and non?hospitalized children with respiratory infections using microarrays","abstract":"The impact of viral co?infections and recently discovered viruses on the epidemiology of respiratory infections in children is still unclear.\n To simultaneously detect viruses that are involved in the aetiology of respiratory infections, we used a DNA/RNA microarray assay that identifies 17 different viruses or viral subtypes.\n Rhinopharyngeal washes were taken from 611 children (aged 1?month to 14?years) who presented in the emergency department with respiratory infections from June 2010 to June 2011 and were treated as outpatients (299, 48.9%) or hospitalized (312, 51.1%).\n Lower respiratory tract infection was diagnosed more often in hospitalized children (68% versus 36%, p?0.001).\n Of 397 children in which microarrays detected viral infection (70.1%), a single virus was found in 228 (57.4%) and two or more viruses in 169 (42.5%).\n The most prevalent viruses among children with positive samples were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in 225 (56.6%), parainfluenza virus (PIV) in 118 (29.7%), rhinovirus (RV) in 73 (18.4%), followed by influenza in 56 (14.1%), adenoviruses in 31 (7.8%), bocavirus in 25 (6.3%), human metapneumovirus in 15 (3.7%) and enteroviruses in 12 (3%).\n Most common viral co?infections were RSVA–RSVB in 46 children (27.2%), RSV–Influenza in 20 (11.8%), RSV–RV in 18 (10.6%) and PIV–RV in 13 (7.7%).\n Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that viral co?infections were associated with increased probability for hospitalization (OR 1.52, 95% CI 1.01–2.29, p?0.04), and previous pneumococcal vaccination was associated with decreased probability for hospitalization (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.33–0.81, p?0.004).\n We conclude that viral co?infections are involved in a significant proportion of children with an acute respiratory infection and may increase the severity of clinical presentation and the risk for hospitalization.\n","id":"PMC7129253","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Blackwell Publishing

Madagascar, July 2008 to June 2009","abstract":"Background\nIn Madagascar, despite an influenza surveillance established since 1978, little is known about the etiology and prevalence of viruses other than influenza causing influenza-like illnesses (ILIs).\n\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nFrom July 2008 to June 2009, we collected respiratory specimens from patients who presented ILIs symptoms in public and private clinics in Antananarivo (the capital city of Madagascar).\n\n ILIs were defined as body temperature ?38°C and cough and at least two of the following symptoms: sore throat, rhinorrhea, headache and muscular pain, for a maximum duration of 3 days.\n\n We screened these specimens using five multiplex real time Reverse Transcription and/or Polymerase Chain Reaction assays for detection of 14 respiratory viruses.\n\n We detected respiratory viruses in 235/313 (75.1%) samples.\n\n Overall influenza virus A (27.3%) was the most common virus followed by rhinovirus (24.8%), RSV (21.2%), adenovirus (6.1%), coronavirus OC43 (6.1%), influenza virus B (3.9%), parainfluenza virus-3 (2.9%), and parainfluenza virus-1 (2.3%).\n\n Co-infections occurred in 29.4% (69/235) of infected patients and rhinovirus was the most detected virus (27.5%).\n\n Children under 5 years were more likely to have one or more detectable virus associated with their ILI.\n\n In this age group, compared to those ?5 years, the risk of detecting more than one virus was higher (OR?=?1.9), as was the risk of detecting of RSV (OR?=?10.1) and adenovirus (OR?=?4.7).\n\n While rhinovirus and adenovirus infections occurred year round, RSV, influenza virus A and coronavirus OC43 had defined period of circulation.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn our study, we found that respiratory viruses play an important role in ILIs in the Malagasy community, particularly in children under 5 years old.\n\n These data provide a better understanding of the viral etiology of outpatients with ILI and describe for the first time importance of these viruses in different age group and their period of circulation.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3048401","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

respiratory infections (ARI) are the major worldwide health problem due to associated high morbidity and mortality rates.\n Adenovirus (Adv) is one of the most common causes of viral ARI, and thus calls for specific diagnosis and better understanding of the epidemiology and clinical characteristics.\n Our aims were to find out the status of Adv infection in children &lt;14 years with ARI, analyze the epidemiology and clinical characteristics among the Adv?infected children in Guangzhou, China, and to provide some basis for the research of Adv.\n The throat and pharyngeal swabs were collected among the children with acute respiratory tract infections in outpatient department from September 2006 to August 2008. The samples were analyzed by PCR and the sequences were blasted with the sequences of Adv in GenBank.\n Clinical data were analyzed along with virological data by using appropriate statistical methods.\n Adv was detected in 25 out of 512 (4.9%) children.\n The genome types of 23 samples were determined after analysis of the gene sequence.\n The most prevalent Adv type was species B type 3. Among the patients, 10 were of Ad3 (43.5%), three were of Ad1 (1.3%), five were of species C Ad2 (21.7%), and five were of species E Ad4 (21.7%).\n A higher incidence of positive results was found during the summer season, thus showing a pattern of seasonality.\n There exists Adv infection in children with acute respiratory system diseases in Guangzhou area.\n No significant differences were found among different age groups and gender groups.\n Co?infections with other respiratory virus were detected in 64% of the Adv positive

respiratory infections are a major cause of morbidity in children both in developed and developing countries.\n A wide range of respiratory viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A and B viruses, parainfluenza viruses (PIVs), adenovirus, rhinovirus (HRV), have repeatedly been detected in acute lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) in children in the past decades.\n However, in the last ten years thanks to progress in molecular technologies, newly discovered viruses have been identified including human Metapneumovirus (hMPV), coronaviruses NL63 (HcoV-NL63) and HKU1 (HcoV-HKU1), human Bocavirus (HBoV), new enterovirus (HEV), parechovirus (HpeV) and rhinovirus (HRV) strains, polyomaviruses WU (WUPyV) and KI (KIPyV) and the pandemic H1N1v influenza A virus.\n These discoveries have heavily modified previous knowledge on respiratory infections mainly highlighting that pediatric population is exposed to a variety of viruses with similar seasonal patterns.\n In this context establishing a causal link between a newly identified virus and the disease as well as an association between mixed infections and an increase in disease severity can be challenging.\n This review will present an overview of newly recognized as well as the main emerging respiratory viruses and seek to focus on the their contribution to infection and

extracted from the nasopharyngeal aspirate and analyzed by high throughput DNA sequencing.\n Multiple DNA fragments were cloned that possessed limited homology to known polyomaviruses.\n We subsequently sequenced the entire virus genome of 5,229 bp, henceforth referred to as WU virus, and found it to have genomic features characteristic of the family Polyomaviridae.\n The genome was predicted to encode small T antigen, large T antigen, and three capsid proteins: VP1, VP2, and VP3. Phylogenetic analysis clearly revealed that the WU virus was divergent from all known polyomaviruses.\n Screening of 2,135 patients with acute respiratory tract infections in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, and St.\n Louis, Missouri, United States, using WU virus–specific PCR primers resulted in the detection of 43 additional specimens that contained WU virus.\n The presence of multiple instances of the virus in two continents suggests that this virus is geographically widespread in the human population and raises the possibility that the WU virus may be a human

Pneumovirinae subfamily within the Paramyxoviridae family.\n Objectives: Since most bronchiolitis studies fail to detect any viral pathogen in part of the samples, we sought for the presence of hMPV in a well characterized bronchiolitis cohort.\n Study design: Nasal washes were obtained from 56 children admitted to the hospital for acute bronchiolitis.\n RNA extraction and subsequent RT-PCR were used to detect hMPV, and correlated the presence of the virus with clinical characteristics of the disease.\n Results and conclusions: PCR revealed the presence of hMPV in 16% of bronchiolitis cases, whereas respiratory syncytial virus (RSV; 67.9%) was the most frequently encountered viral pathogen.\n hMPV was identified either as a unique viral pathogen or co-existed with RSV, with whom they shared a similar seasonal distribution.\n There were no differences in disease characteristics, either clinical or laboratory, between bronchiolitis cases where hMPV was present and those caused by RSV or other viral pathogens.\n","id":"PMC7129958","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

respiratory syncytial virus and viruses identified recently in infants with acute respiratory disease","abstract":"A prospective 2?year analysis including 322 infant patients with acute respiratory disease (ARD) hospitalized in a pediatric department in northern Italy was carried out to evaluate the role as respiratory pathogens or co?pathogens of recently identified viruses.\n The presence of respiratory syncitial virus (RSV), human Metapneumoviruses (hMPVs), human Bocaviruses (hBoVs), and human Coronaviruses (hCoVs) was assayed by molecular detection and clinical symptoms evaluated.\n Nasopharyngeal aspirates from 150 of the 322 infants (46.6%) tested positive for at least one pathogen.\n Ninety samples (28.0%) tested positive for RSV RNA (61.5% genotype A and 38.5% genotype B), 46 (14.3%) for hMPV RNA (71.7% subtype A and 28.3% subtype B), 28 (8.7%) for hCoV RNA (39.3% hCoV?OC43, 35.7% hCoV?NL63, 21.4% hCoV?HKU1, and 3.6% hCoV?229E), and 7 (2.2%) for hBoV DNA (of the 6 typed, 50% subtype 1 and 50% subtype 2); 21/150 samples revealed the presence of 2 or more viruses.\n Co?infection rates were higher for hMPVs, hCoVs, and hBoV (38.3%, 46.4%, and 57.1%,) and lower for RSV (23.3%).\n RSV was associated with the presence of complications (P?&lt;?0.001) and hypoxia (P?&lt;?0.015).\n When the presence of RSV alone and the RSV?hMPV co?infections were considered, RSV mono?infected patients resulted to have longer hospitalization and higher hypoxia (P?&lt;?0.001).\n The data highlight that (i) RSV has a central role as a respiratory pathogen of infants, (ii) the wide circulation of recently identified viruses does not reduce the clinical and epidemiological importance of RSV, and that (iii) recently identified agents (hMPVs, hBoVs, and hCoVs) act as primary pathogens or co?pathogens.\n J.\n Med.\n Virol.\n 80:716–723, 2008. © 2008 Wiley?Liss, Inc.\n","id":"PMC7167101","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Wiley Subscription Services, Inc., A

association with disease in young children with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI).\n\n\nMethods and Findings\nNine hundred forty-nine samples of nasopharyngeal secretions from children under 3 y of age with LRTIs were analysed by a quantitative HCoV-NL63-specific real-time PCR.\n\n The samples had been collected from hospitalised patients and outpatients from December 1999 to October 2001 in four different regions in Germany as part of the prospective population-based PRI.\n\nDE study and analysed for RNA from respiratory viruses.\n\n Forty-nine samples (5.2%), mainly derived from the winter season, were positive for HCoV-NL63 RNA.\n\n The viral RNA was more prevalent in samples from outpatients (7.9%) than from hospitalised patients (3.2%, p = 0.003), and co-infection with either respiratory syncytial virus or parainfluenza virus 3 was observed frequently.\n\n Samples in which only HCoV-NL63 RNA could be detected had a significantly higher viral load than samples containing additional respiratory viruses (median 2.1 × 106 versus 2.7 × 102 copies/ml, p = 0.0006).\n\n A strong association with croup was apparent: 43% of the HCoV-NL63-positive patients with high HCoV-NL63 load and absence of co-infection suffered from croup, compared to 6% in the HCoV-NL63-negative group, p &lt; 0.0001. A significantly higher fraction (17.4%) of samples from croup patients than from non-croup patients (4.2%) contained HCoV-NL63 RNA.\n\n\nConclusion\nHCoV-NL63 infections occur frequently in young children with LRTI and show a strong association with croup, suggesting a causal relationship.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1188248","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

Novel Bocavirus Associated with Acute Gastroenteritis in Australian Children","abstract":"Acute gastroenteritis (AGE) is a common illness affecting all age groups worldwide, causing an estimated three million deaths annually.\n Viruses such as rotavirus, adenovirus, and caliciviruses are a major cause of AGE, but in many patients a causal agent cannot be found despite extensive diagnostic testing.\n Proposing that novel viruses are the reason for this diagnostic gap, we used molecular screening to investigate a cluster of undiagnosed cases that were part of a larger case control study into the etiology of pediatric AGE.\n Degenerate oligonucleotide primed (DOP) PCR was used to non-specifically amplify viral DNA from fecal specimens.\n The amplified DNA was then cloned and sequenced for analysis.\n A novel virus was detected.\n Elucidation and analysis of the genome indicates it is a member of the Bocavirus genus of the Parvovirinae, 23% variant at the nucleotide level from its closest formally recognized relative, the Human Bocavirus (HBoV), and similar to the very recently proposed second species of Bocavirus (HBoV2).\n Fecal samples collected from case control pairs during 2001 for the AGE study were tested with a bocavirus-specific PCR, and HBoV2 (sequence confirmed) was detected in 32 of 186 cases with AGE (prevalence 17.2%) compared with only 15 controls (8.1%).\n In this same group of children, HBoV2 prevalence was exceeded only by rotavirus (39.2%) and astrovirus (21.5%) and was more prevalent than norovirus genogroup 2 (13.4%) and adenovirus (4.8%).\n In a univariate analysis of the matched pairs (McNemar's Test), the odds ratio for the association of AGE with HBoV2 infection was 2.6 (95% confidence interval 1.2–5.7); P?=?0.007. During the course of this screening, a second novel bocavirus was detected which we have designated HBoV species 3 (HBoV3).\n The prevalence of HBoV3 was low (2.7%), and it was not associated with AGE.\n HBoV2 and HBoV3 are newly discovered bocaviruses, of which HBoV2 is the thirdmost-prevalent virus, after rotavirus and astrovirus, associated with pediatric AGE in this study.\n","id":"PMC2663820","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Jane

of HBoV and its co-infection.\n\n The seroepidemiology of HBoV was studied by ELISA and Western blot against the capsid protein VP2-based fragment.\n\n Persistence of HBoV was also analyzed in 12 pairs of return-visit cases.\n\n\nResults\nHBoV was identified in 96 samples (11.8%).\n\n The co-infection rate with other respiratory viruses was 51%.\n\n IgM was detected in 55.7% of HBoV RT-PCR-positive patients, and in 72.7% of those who had high viral genome load.\n\n In addition, persistent viral DNA positivity was detected in 10 of 12 HBoV-positive cases tested, an average of 14 days later, and one child was still HBoV-positive after 31 days.\n\n\nConclusion\nHBoV was found frequently in children with respiratory tract symptoms associated with other respiratory viruses, and persisted in the respiratory tract and in serum and urine.\n\n The presence of IgM was significantly more prevalent in viremic patients and those diagnosed with high load of HBoV DNA in nasal/throat swabs.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7172221","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

polyomaviruses (BKPyV and JCPyV) have been associated with illness in immunocompromised patients, and some studies suggest a higher prevalence of WUPyV and KIPyV in this population.\n\n\nObjective\nTo determine whether a higher prevalence or viral load for WUPyV and KIPyV exists in immunocompromised children compared with immunocompetent children.\n\n\nStudy design\nWe measured the prevalence and viral load of WU and KI PyV by quantitative real-time PCR of viral DNA in respiratory tract specimens from pediatric hematology/oncology patients and immunocompetent controls with acute respiratory

infection in children and in adult stem cell transplant recipients","abstract":"Background\nA novel human enterovirus (HEV) type within the species HEV-C, named EV109, was discovered from cases of respiratory illness in Nicaragua in September 2010. The aim of this study, was to retrospectively examine the presence and the role of EV109 in respiratory samples from two patients populations; infants below the age of 2?years, hospitalized for acute respiratory diseases (ARDs) and adult hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 1149 nasopharingeal aspirates were collected and tested for the presence of EV109 by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR).\n\n In positive samples, the presence of the most common respiratory viruses was also assayed and clinical symptoms were evaluated.\n\n Samples from 2 of the 974 infants tested positive for EV109 RNA (0.2%) and belonged to patients with lower ARDs; co-infection with other viral pathogens under study was observed in both cases.\n\n In transplant recipients, one out of the 175 samples analyzed, from a patients with upper respiratory simptoms tested positive for HEV 109 in the absence of co-infecting viruses.\n\n Sequence analysis of amplified EV109 genomic regions, showed only a few nucleotide differences when compared with the Nicaraguan strains.\n\n\nConclusions\nOverall these results indicate that HEV109 variants have circulated and differentiated in different lineages worldwide.\n\n Although more cases and larger studies are needed, HEV109 infection may be associated to ARDs both in infants and in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients.\n\n If these preliminary observations will be confirmed, improved molecular methods with a wider panel of potential pathogens will be useful for monitoring these categories of patients.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3477084","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

myxovirus infection and implement appropriate prevention measures.\n\n The limited use of molecular tools underestimates the role of other common pathogens.\n\n\nObjectives\nDuring the early weeks of the 2009–2010 flu pandemic, a clinical and virological survey was conducted in adult and paediatric patients with ILI referred to two French University hospitals in Paris and Tours.\n\n Aims were to investigate the different pathogens involved in ILI and describe the associated symptoms.\n\n\nMethods\nH1N1v pandemic influenza diagnosis was performed with real time RT-PCR assay.\n\n Other viral aetiologies were investigated by the molecular multiplex assay RespiFinder19®.\n\n Clinical data were collected prospectively by physicians using a standard questionnaire.\n\n\nResults\nFrom week 35 to 44, endonasal swabs were collected in 413 patients.\n\n Overall, 68 samples (16.5%) were positive for H1N1v.\n\n In 13 of them, other respiratory pathogens were also detected.\n\n Among H1N1v negative samples, 213 (61.9%) were positive for various respiratory agents, 190 in single infections and 23 in mixed infections.\n\n The most prevalent viruses in H1N1v negative single infections were rhinovirus (62.6%), followed by parainfluenza viruses (24.2%) and adenovirus (5.3%).\n\n 70.6% of H1N1v cases were identified in patients under 40 years and none after 65 years.\n\n There was no difference between clinical symptoms observed in patients infected with H1N1v or with other pathogens.\n\n\nConclusion\nOur results highlight the high frequency of non-influenza viruses involved in ILI during the pre-epidemic period of a flu alert and the lack of specific clinical signs associated with influenza infections.\n\n Rapid diagnostic screening of a large panel of respiratory pathogens may be critical to define and survey the epidemic situation and to provide critical information for patient management.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3157400","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public

bronchiolitis.\n\n\nINTRODUCTION:\nBronchiolitis is a major cause of morbidity in infants.\n\n Widespread use of molecular-based methods has yielded new insights about its etiology, but the impact of viral etiologies on early outcomes is still unclear.\n\n\nMETHODS:\nSeventy-seven infants with bronchiolitis who were under two years of age and visited an emergency unit were included.\n\n Using molecular-based methods, samples were tested for 12 different respiratory viruses.\n\n Logistic regression models were used to identify clinical and virological variables associated with the main endpoints: hospital admission and ICU admission.\n\n\nRESULTS:\nWe identified at least one virus in 93.5% of patients, and coinfections were found in nearly 40% of patients.\n\n RSV was the most common pathogen (63.6%), followed by rhinovirus (39%).\n\n Identification of RSV was only associated with an increased risk of hospital admission in the univariate model.\n\n Younger age and enterovirus infection were associated with an increased risk of hospital admission, while atopy of a first-degree relative showed a protective effect.\n\n Prematurity was associated with an increased risk of admission to the ICU.\n\n Coinfections were not associated with worse outcomes.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\nMolecular-based methods resulted in high rates of viral identification but did not change the significant role of RSV in acute bronchiolitis.\n\n Younger age and enterovirus infection were risk factors for hospital admission, while prematurity appeared to be a significant risk factor for admission to the ICU in acute viral bronchiolitis.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2999709","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Hospital das Clínicas da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de São

old: High rate of viral coinfection","abstract":"The occurrence of viral coinfections in childhood pneumonia has received little attention, probably because suitable detection methods have been lacking.\n Between November 2004 and October 2006, the presence of 14 respiratory viruses in children aged less than 3 years old with community?acquired pneumonia were investigated using molecular or immunochromatographic techniques and/or viral culture.\n A total of 315 children (338 episodes) were included, and hospitalization was required in 178 episodes.\n At least one virus was detected in 66.9% of the episodes and simultaneous detection of two or more viruses was frequent (27% of the episodes with viral detection).\n The most frequently detected virus was respiratory syncytial virus (n?=?67: 33 subgroup A, 33 subgroup B, 1 not typed), followed by human bocavirus (n?=?48), rhinovirus (n?=?46), human metapneumovirus (n?=?39: 13 genotype A2, 8 B1, 5 B2, 1 A1, 12 not genotyped) and parainfluenza viruses (n?=?38: 1 type 1, 3 type 2, 22 type 3, 11 type 4 and 1 not typed).\n The 14 viruses investigated were found in viral coinfections, which were more frequent in children aged less than 12 months.\n Except for adenovirus, the incidence of which was low, the percentage of viral coinfection ranged between 28.2% and 68.8%.\n Children with viral coinfection more frequently required hospital admission than those with single viral infection.\n It is concluded that viral coinfections are frequent in children aged less than 3 years old with community?acquired pneumonia and can be a poor prognostic factor.\n J.\n Med.\n Virol.\n 80:1843–1849, 2008. © 2008 Wiley?Liss, Inc.\n","id":"PMC7166914","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Wiley Subscription Services, Inc., A

NL63","abstract":"Background\nThe clinical relevance of infections with the novel human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) has not been investigated systematically.\n\n We therefore determined its association with disease in young children with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI).\n\n\nMethods and Findings\nNine hundred forty-nine samples of nasopharyngeal secretions from children under 3 y of age with LRTIs were analysed by a quantitative HCoV-NL63-specific real-time PCR.\n\n The samples had been collected from hospitalised patients and outpatients from December 1999 to October 2001 in four different regions in Germany as part of the prospective population-based PRI.\n\nDE study and analysed for RNA from respiratory viruses.\n\n Forty-nine samples (5.2%), mainly derived from the winter season, were positive for HCoV-NL63 RNA.\n\n The viral RNA was more prevalent in samples from outpatients (7.9%) than from hospitalised patients (3.2%, p = 0.003), and co-infection with either respiratory syncytial virus or parainfluenza virus 3 was observed frequently.\n\n Samples in which only HCoV-NL63 RNA could be detected had a significantly higher viral load than samples containing additional respiratory viruses (median 2.1 × 106 versus 2.7 × 102 copies/ml, p = 0.0006).\n\n A strong association with croup was apparent: 43% of the HCoV-NL63-positive patients with high HCoV-NL63 load and absence of co-infection suffered from croup, compared to 6% in the HCoV-NL63-negative group, p &lt; 0.0001. A significantly higher fraction (17.4%) of samples from croup patients than from non-croup patients (4.2%) contained HCoV-NL63 RNA.\n\n\nConclusion\nHCoV-NL63 infections occur frequently in young children with LRTI and show a strong association with croup, suggesting a causal relationship.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1188248","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

tract infection (ARTI).\n\n A prospective study of children admitted with ARTI was conducted.\n\n Peripheral blood samples were analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence to detect respiratory agents including respiratory syncytial virus; adenovirus; influenza virus (Flu) types A and B; parainfluenza virus (PIV) types 1, 2, and 3; chlamydia pneumonia; and mycoplasma pneumonia.\n\n A medical history of each child was taken.\n\n\nResults\nRespiratory agents were detected in 164 (51.9%) of 316 children with ARTI.\n\n A single agent was identified in 50 (15.8%) children, and multiple agents in 114 (36.1%).\n\n Flu A was the most frequently detected agent, followed by Flu B.\n\n Coinfection occurred predominantly in August and was more frequent in children between 3 and 6 years of age.\n\n A significantly higher proportion of Flu A, Flu B, and PIV 1 was detected in samples with two or more pathogens per sample than in samples with a single pathogen.\n\n\nConclusion\nOur study suggests that there is a high occurrence of multipathogen infections in children admitted with ARTI and that coinfection is associated with certain pathogens.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2762469","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

time PCR is increasingly used to diagnose respiratory viruses and has shown to be superior to traditional methods, like culture and antigen detection.\n\n However, comprehensive data on sensitivity, specificity and performance of the multiplex PCR compared to the single target PCR's is limited for most published respiratory multiplex real time PCR assays.\n\n\nObjectives\nDevelopment and extensive analysis of an internally controlled multiplex real time rt-PCR for detection of respiratory viruses.\n\n\nStudy design\nThe assay was validated in comparison to single-target PCR's using plasmid targets and prospectively collected nasopharyngeal aspirates.\n\n\nResults\nUsing plasmid targets the multiplex format was found to be as least as sensitive and specific as the single-target PCR and no competition was observed when different targets were present at different amounts in one tube.\n\n Clinical validation showed high concordance for all viruses tested except for samples with low levels of enterovirus.\n\n\nConclusion\nThis multiplex showed excellent specificities for all 14 respiratory viruses and sensitivity was high except for clinical samples with low levels of

Nanjing, China.\n The two largest general hospitals and a provincial virus laboratory in Nanjing participated in this study.\n Throat swabs were collected from outpatients during medical visits for influenza?like illness and were tested for 16 respiratory viruses using PCR.\n Three hundred seventeen viruses were detected in samples from 246 (50.6%) patients with influenza?like illness.\n The viruses found mostly commonly were influenza, rhinovirus, hCoV HKU1, and adenovirus.\n The identification rates of respiratory viruses differed significantly among different sampling seasons

(ALRI) are the major cause of morbidity and mortality in young children worldwide.\n\n Information on viral etiology in ALRI from India is limited.\n\n The aim of the present study was to develop a simple, sensitive, specific and cost effective multiplex PCR (mPCR) assay without post PCR hybridization or nested PCR steps for the detection of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses (PIV1–3) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV).\n\n Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) were collected from children with ALRI ? 5 years of age.\n\n The sensitivity and specificity of mPCR was compared to virus isolation by centrifugation enhanced culture (CEC) followed by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF).\n\n\nResults\nFrom April 2005–March 2007, 301 NPAs were collected from children attending the outpatient department or admitted to the ward of All India Institute of Medical Sciences hospital at New Delhi, India.\n\n Multiplex PCR detected respiratory viruses in 106 (35.2%) of 301 samples with 130 viruses of which RSV was detected in 61, PIV3 in 22, PIV2 in 17, hMPV in 11, PIV1 in 10 and influenza A in 9 children.\n\n CEC-IIF detected 79 viruses only.\n\n The sensitivity of mPCR was 0.1TCID50 for RSV and influenza A and 1TCID50 for hMPV, PIV1, PIV2, PIV3 and Influenza B.\n\n Mixed infections were detected in 18.8% of the children with viral infections, none detected by CEC-IIF.\n\n Bronchiolitis was significantly associated with both total viral infections and RSV infection (p &lt; 0.05).\n\n History of ARI in family predisposed children to acquire

by two multiplex reverse transcription nested?PCR assays","abstract":"There is a need for rapid, sensitive, and accurate diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infections in children, elderly, and immunocompromised patients, who are susceptible to serious complications.\n The multiplex RT?nested PCR assay has been used widely for simultaneous detection of non?related viruses involved in infectious diseases because of its high specificity and sensitivity.\n A new multiplex RT?PCR assay is described in this report.\n This approach includes nested primer sets targeted to conserve regions of human parainfluenza virus haemagglutinin, human coronavirus spike protein, and human enterovirus and rhinovirus polyprotein genes.\n It permits rapid, sensitive, and simultaneous detection and typing of the four types of parainfluenza viruses (1, 2, 3, 4AB), human coronavirus 229E and OC43, and the generic detection of enteroviruses and rhinoviruses.\n The testing of 201 clinical specimens with this multiplex assay along with other one formerly described by our group to simultaneously detect and type the influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial viruses, and a generic detection of all serotypes of adenovirus, covers the detection of most viruses causing respiratory infectious disease in humans.\n The results obtained were compared with conventional viral culture, immunofluorescence assay, and a third multiplex RT?PCR assay for all human parainfluenza viruses types described previously.\n In conclusion, both multiplex RT?PCR assays provide a system capable of detecting and identifying simultaneously 14 different respiratory viruses in clinical specimens with high sensitivity and specificity, being useful for routine diagnosis and survey of these viruses within the population.\n J.\n Med.\n Virol.\n 72:484–495, 2004. © 2004 Wiley?Liss, Inc.\n","id":"PMC7166637","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Wiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley

frequency of ARI is similar in both developed and developing countries, mortality due to ARI is 10–50 times higher in developing countries.\n\n Viruses are common causes of ARI among such children, yet the disease burden of these infections in rural communities is unknown.\n\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nA prospective longitudinal study was carried out in children enrolled from two rural Indian villages at birth and followed weekly for the development of ARI, classified as upper respiratory infection, acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI), or severe ALRI.\n\n Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza, parainfluenza viruses and adenoviruses in nasopharyngeal aspirates were detected by direct fluorescent antibody testing (DFA) and, in addition, centrifugation enhanced culture for RSV was done.\n\n 281 infants enrolled in 39 months and followed until 42 months.\n\n During 440 child years of follow-up there were 1307 ARIs, including 236 ALRIs and 19 severe ALRIs.\n\n Virus specific incidence rates per 1000 child years for RSV were total ARI 234, ALRI 39, and severe ALRI 9; for influenza A total ARI 141, ALRI 39; for INF B total ARI 37; for PIV1 total ARI 23, for PIV2 total ARI 28, ALRI 5; for parainfluenza virus 3 total ARI 229, ALRI 48, and severe ALRI 5 and for adenovirus total ARI 18, ALRI 5. Repeat infections with RSV were seen in 18 children.\n\n\nConclusions/Significance\nRSV, influenza A and parainfluenza virus 3 were important causes of ARI among children in rural communities in India.\n\n These data will be useful for vaccine design, development and implementation purposes.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1876256","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

was one log more sensitive for the detection of RSV according to the endpoint dilution technique than the culture method or a conventional qualitative RT-PCR-hybridization-EIA.\n No cross-reactivity was observed with any of the viruses that could be found in the respiratory tract.\n RSV and GAPDH were quantified in nasal aspirates from 75 children hospitalised for acute respiratory tract disease: 31 (41.3%) were positive according to the immunofluorescence assay (IFA), 34 (45.3%) were culture-positive and 42 (56%) were positive according to our real-time RT-PCR method.\n The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of the real-time RT-PCR were 100, 90, 92, 100%, respectively.\n The samples found to be positive for RSV were classified according to the severity

viruses in community-acquired childhood pneumonia in semi-urban Nepal; a cross-sectional study","abstract":"Background\nPneumonia is among the main causes of illness and death in children &lt;5 years of age.\n\n There is a need to better describe the epidemiology of viral community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in developing countries.\n\n\nMethods\nFrom July 2004 to June 2007, we examined nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) from 2,230 cases of pneumonia (World Health Organization criteria) in children 2 to 35 months old recruited in a randomized trial of zinc supplementation at a field clinic in Bhaktapur, Nepal.\n\n The specimens were examined for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus type A (InfA) and B (InfB), parainfluenza virus types 1, 2 and 3 (PIV1, PIV2, and PIV3), and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) using a multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay.\n\n\nResults\nWe identified 919 virus isolates in 887 (40.0%) of the 2,219 NPA specimens with a valid PCR result, of which 334 (15.1%) yielded RSV, 164 (7.4%) InfA, 129 (5.8%) PIV3, 98 (4.4%) PIV1, 93 (4.2%) hMPV, 84 (3.8%) InfB, and 17 (0.8%) PIV2. CAP occurred in an epidemic pattern with substantial temporal variation during the three years of study.\n\n The largest peaks of pneumonia occurrence coincided with peaks of RSV infection, which occurred in epidemics during the rainy season and in winter.\n\n The monthly number of RSV infections was positively correlated with relative humidity (rs = 0.40, P = 0.01), but not with temperature or rainfall.\n\n An hMPV epidemic occurred during one of the three winter seasons and the monthly number of hMPV cases was also associated with relative humidity (rs = 0.55, P = 0.0005).\n\n\nConclusion\nRespiratory RNA viruses were detected from NPA in 40% of CAP cases in our study.\n\n The most commonly isolated viruses were RSV, InfA, and PIV3. RSV infections contributed substantially to the observed CAP epidemics.\n\n The occurrence of viral CAP in this community seemed to reflect more or less overlapping micro-epidemics with several respiratory viruses, highlighting the challenges of developing and implementing effective public health control measures.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2727531","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Maria","surname":"Mathisen","email":"maria.mathisen@cih.uib.no","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tor A","surname":"Strand","email":"tor.strand@cih.uib.no","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Biswa N","surname":"Sharma","email":"biswasharma@hotmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ram K","surname":"Chandyo","email":"ram.chandyo@cih.uib.no","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Palle","surname":"Valentiner-Branth","email":"PVB@ssi.dk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sudha","surname":"Basnet","email":"sudhacbasnet@gmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ramesh K","surname":"Adhikari","email":"ramesh@healthnet.org.np","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Dag","surname":"Hvidsten","email":"Dag.Hvidsten@unn.no","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Prakash S","surname":"Shrestha","email":"shresthaps@hotmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Halvor","surname":"Sommerfelt","email":"halvor.sommerfelt@cih.uib.no","contributions":"1"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"10.1046/j.1365-3156.1998.00213.x","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Respiratory syncytial virus infection in tropical and developing countries","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/S1045-1870(98)80035-6","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Viral pneumonia in children","abstract":"Viral pneumonia causes a heavy burden on our society.\n In the United States, more than one million cases of pneumonias afflict children under the age of 5 years, costing hundreds of millions of dollars annually.\n The majority of these infections are caused by a handful of common viruses.\n Knowledge of the epidemiology of these viruses combined with new rapid diagnostic techniques will provide faster and more, reliable diagnoses in the future.\n Although the basic clinical epidemiology of these viruses has been carefully investigated over the last 30 years, new molecular techniques are greatly expanding our understanding of these agents and the diseases they cause.\n Antigenic and genetic variations are being discovered in many viruses previously thought to be homogeneous.\n The exact roles and the biological significance of these variations are just beginning to be explored, but already evidence of differences in pathogenicity and immunogenicity has been found in many of these substrains.\n All of this information clearly will impact the development of future vaccines and antiviral drugs.\n Effective drugs exist for prophylaxis against influenza A and respiratory syncytial virus, and specific therapy exists for influenza A.\n Ribarivin is approved for use in respiratory synctial virus infections, and it alone or in combination with other agents (eg, IGIV) may be effective in immunocompromised patients, either in preventing the development of pneumonia or in decreasing morbidity and mortality.\n Many new antiviral agents are being tested and developed, and several are in clinical trials.\n","id":"PMC7129604","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Published by Elsevier Inc.","authors":[{"firstname":"Kelly J.","surname":"Henrickson","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Epidemiology of acute respiratory infections in children of developing countries","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1542/peds.113.6.1758","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Population-based surveillance for hospitalizations associated with respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, and parainfluenza viruses among young children","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"National disease burden of respiratory viruses detected in children by polymerase chain reaction","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The epidemiology of acute respiratory tract infection in young children: comparison of findings from several developing countries.

of viruses in respiratory tract specimens.\n In the present study, the application of a multiplex RT?PCR DNA microarray in diagnosis and epidemiological survey of viral infections in infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis was assessed.\n One hundred and thirty?eight nasopharyngeal aspirates collected from October 2007 to September 2008 were tested by direct immunofluorescence and viral culture, a combination of referenced RT?PCRs and the DNA microarray.\n One or more viruses were detected in 96, 126 and 126 of the specimens by direct immunofluorescence and viral culture, RT?PCRs and DNA microarray, respectively (70 vs.\n 91 vs.\n 91%, P?&lt;?10?3).\n The RT?PCRs and the DNA microarray yielded concordant results for 99% of specimens and identified mixed viral infections in 85 (62%).\n The most common associations were: human bocavirus and respiratory syncytial virus (32%), adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus (30%), and parainfluenza virus type 3 and respiratory syncytial virus (23%).\n None of the bronchiolitis severity parameters including intensive care unit admission, O2 supply, O2 saturation percentage, O2 length and length of stay at the hospital appeared to be significantly increased in multiple viral infections compared to single viral infections (P?&gt;?0.1).\n In conclusion, the use of this DNA microarray in clinical virology practice allows rapid and accurate identification of common and uncommon viral respiratory pathogens in infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis.\n It should improve the clinical management, the epidemiological

association between the occurrence of co-infection and substantially higher severity of disease is still unclear, a rapid and proper diagnostics of wide spectrum of viral respiratory pathogens reveals an accurate picture of the disease and is essential for appropriate therapeutic management and control of infection.\n In the present study we reported five cases of multiple respiratory infection in hospitalized immunosuppressed patients: two double infections with influenza virus (IV) type A/respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) type A and IV type A/coronavirus (CoV) OC43, one infection with four viruses – IV type A/RSV type A and B/CoV OC43, and two cases of mixed infections caused by five viral agents – IV type A and B/RSV type A and B/ parainfluenza type 3 or CoV OC43. Each patient had an underlying chronic disease and received immunosuppressive treatment.\n Despite a low number of tested specimens, our study shows that the inclusions of multiplex PCR methods for diagnostics of respiratory tract infections and the extension of diagnostic strategies by clinicians to detect viruses other than influenza are very important and make a contribution to identifying the true rate of co-infections and their correlation with the clinical symptoms and severity of disease.\n","id":"PMC7120114","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"NULL","authors":[{"firstname":"Mieczyslaw","surname":"Pokorski","email":"m_pokorski@hotmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"I.","surname":"Stefanska","email":"i.stefanska@gmail.com","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"I.","surname":"Stefanska","email":"i.stefanska@gmail.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"M.","surname":"Romanowska","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"S.","surname":"Donevski","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"D.","surname":"Gawryluk","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"L.

attention, probably because suitable detection methods have been lacking.\n Between November 2004 and October 2006, the presence of 14 respiratory viruses in children aged less than 3 years old with community?acquired pneumonia were investigated using molecular or immunochromatographic techniques and/or viral culture.\n A total of 315 children (338 episodes) were included, and hospitalization was required in 178 episodes.\n At least one virus was detected in 66.9% of the episodes and simultaneous detection of two or more viruses was frequent (27% of the episodes with viral detection).\n The most frequently detected virus was respiratory syncytial virus (n?=?67: 33 subgroup A, 33 subgroup B, 1 not typed), followed by human bocavirus (n?=?48), rhinovirus (n?=?46), human metapneumovirus (n?=?39: 13 genotype A2, 8 B1, 5 B2, 1 A1, 12 not genotyped) and parainfluenza viruses (n?=?38: 1 type 1, 3 type 2, 22 type 3, 11 type 4 and 1 not typed).\n The 14 viruses investigated were found in viral coinfections, which were more frequent in children aged less than 12 months.\n Except for adenovirus, the incidence of which was low, the percentage of viral coinfection ranged between 28.2% and 68.8%.\n Children with viral coinfection more frequently required hospital admission than those with single viral infection.\n It is concluded that viral coinfections are frequent in children aged

interactions.\n We use the model to calculate the duration of detectable coinfection and examine how it varies as initial viral dose and time of infection are varied.\n We find that rhinovirus, the fastest-growing virus, reduces replication of the remaining viruses during a coinfection, while parainfluenza virus, the slowest-growing virus is suppressed in the presence of other

respiratory disease (BRD) in adult dairy cows (n = 35) from a commercial dairy herd in Southern Brazil were investigated.\n Pulmonary samples were examined for histopathologic patterns and specific features within these patterns, while immunohistochemical (IHC) assays were designed to detect the intralesional antigens of viral infectious disease agents and Mycoplasma bovis.\n Pneumonia was diagnosed in 91.4% (32/35) of these cases; neither pneumonia nor any of the infectious disease pathogens evaluated occurred in three cows.\n The presence of multiple respiratory pathogens in 75% (24/32) of these cases indicated the complex origin of pneumonia in cattle.\n Interstitial pneumonia, necrosuppurative bronchopneumonia and suppurative bronchopneumonia were the principal patterns of pulmonary disease identified by histopathology.\n The most frequent pathogens identified by IHC were bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV; n = 18), M.\n bovis (n = 16) and bovine alphaherpesvirus type 1 (BoHV?1; n = 14), followed by bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV; n = 11) and bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 (BPIV?3; n = 5).\n Obliterative bronchiolitis and peribronchial lymphocytic cuffings were the characteristic histopathologic features associated with M.\n bovis.\n Necrohemorrhagic bronchitis with bronchial angiogenesis was associated with BoHV?1. Necrotizing bronchitis and bronchiolitis were associated with BVDV, BoHV?1 and BRSV.\n Ballooning degeneration of the bronchial and bronchiolar epithelia was associated with BRSV and BoHV?1. This is the first report from Brazil that correlated the histopathologic findings of BRD with the associated infectious disease agents by immunohistochemistry.\n M.\n bovis was frequently detected in the tissues of cows with fatal pulmonary disease during this study and may be a possible primary disease pathogen associated with the development of BRD in dairy cows.\n Additionally, the histopathologic features identified within patterns of pulmonary disease during this investigation may be an efficient diagnostic tool to associate histopathologic findings with specific agents of BRD in dairy cows.\n","id":"PMC7228412","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley and Sons Inc.","authors":[{"firstname":"Thalita Evani

histopathological findings in bovine respiratory disease from western Canada","abstract":"The aetiology and pathogenesis of bovine respiratory disease (BRD) are complex and involve the interplay of infectious agents, management and environmental factors.\n Previous studies of BRD focused on ante?mortem samples from the upper respiratory tract and identified several unconventional viruses.\n The lung, however, is the primary location where significant BRD lesions are usually found and is a common post?mortem diagnostic specimen.\n In this study, results of high?throughput virome sequencing, bacterial culture, targeted real?time PCR and histological examination of 130 bovine pneumonic lungs from western Canadian cattle were combined to explore associations of microorganisms with different types of pneumonia.\n Fibrinous bronchopneumonia (FBP) was the predominant type of pneumonia (46.2%, 60/130) and was associated with the detection of Mannheimia haemolytica.\n Detection of Histophilus somni and Pasteurella multocida was associated with suppurative bronchopneumonia (SBP) and concurrent bronchopneumonia and bronchointerstitial pneumonia (BP&amp;BIP), respectively.\n Sixteen viruses were identified, of which bovine parvovirus 2 (BPV2) was the most prevalent (11.5%, 15/130) followed by ungulate tetraparvovirus 1 (UTPV1, 8.5%, 11/130) and bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV, 8.5%, 11/130).\n None of these viruses, however, were significantly associated with a particular type of pneumonia.\n Unconventional viruses such as influenza D virus (IDV) and bovine rhinitis B virus (BRBV) were detected, although sparsely, consistent with our previous findings in upper respiratory tract samples.\n Taken together, our results show that while virus detection in post?mortem lung samples is of relatively little diagnostic value, the strong associations of H.\n somni and M.\n haemolytica with SBP and FBP, respectively, indicate that histopathology can be useful in differentiating bacterial aetiologies.\n","id":"PMC7168541","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley and Sons

immunosuppression in the affected individuals.\n Interestingly, no comparative/equivalent cases were found in domestic animals.\n This report describes the pathological and mycological findings associated with diphtheric aspergillosis tracheitis in an immunocompromised calf.\n The main pathological findings were diphtheric tracheitis and rhinitis, and necrotizing ruminitis associated with intralesional septate, acute branching fungal hyphae consistent with Aspergillus spp.\n Mycological culture and isolation confirmed the fungal hyphae as A.\n fumigatus due to characteristic features.\n Immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays identified intralesional antigens of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) and malignant catarrhal fever virus (MCFV) at the trachea and small intestine; IHC detected intralesional antigens of bovine alphaherpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1) only at the trachea.\n These findings confirmed the simultaneous occurrence of A.\n fumigatus with concomitant infections due to BVDV, MCFV, and BoHV-1 in this calf.\n Since ovine gammaherpesvirus-2 (OvHV-2) is the cause of MCF in Brail, it is likely that the intralesional MCFV antigens identified were those of OvHV-2. In this case, disseminated aspergillosis was probably associated with the undeveloped immunological status of the calf that was further impaired due to the combined immunodepressive effects of BVDV and BoHV-1 infections.\n Although BVDV and BoHV-1 are infectious disease pathogens frequently associated with the development of bovine respiratory disease (BRD) in feedlot and dairy cattle, the identification of intralesional OvHV-2-like antigens in several parts of the lungs suggest that this MCFV also played a role in the BRD-associated lesions identified in this calf.\n","id":"PMC7476962","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Selwyn Arlington","surname":"Headley","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Melissa Cristina","surname":"Müller","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Thalita Evani Silva","surname":"de Oliveira","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Caroline Ambiel","surname":"Barros Gil Duarte","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Priscilla Fajardo","surname":"Valente Pereira","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Marcos Vinícius","surname":"Vieira","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Cristina Wetzel","surname":"Cunha","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Eduardo Furtado","surname":"Flores","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Júlio Augusto Naylor","surname":"Lisbôa","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lucienne Garcia","surname":"Pretto-Giordano","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1128/JCM.32.7.1674-1679.1994","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Competitive inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for antibody in sheep and other ruminants to a conserved epitope of malignant catarrhal fever virus","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1099/vir.0.81238-0","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A novel subgroup of rhadinoviruses in ruminants","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Ocorrencia do virus da febre catarral maligna em bovinos do estado do Parana, Sul do Brasil: um estudo imuno-histoquimico retrospectivo [master's thesis]","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1177/030098588001700107","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The pathomorphology of malignant catarrhal fever: 1.

amounts of virus: Group A received 102.55TCID50/ml, group B 105.25TCID50/ml and group C 106.7TCID 50/ml.\n A fourth group (D) was inoculated with a medium dose (105.25TCID50/ml) and concomitantly treated with dexamethasone (DMS) to assess the effects of chemically induced immunosuppression.\n Naïve calves were added as sentinel animals to assess virus transmission.\n The outcome of infection was dose dependent with animals given a higher dose developing severe disease and more pronounced viral replication.\n Despite virus being shed by the low-dose infection group, BVD was not transmitted to sentinel calves.\n Administration of dexamethasone (DMS) resulted in more severe clinical signs, prolonged viraemia and virus shedding.\n Using PCR techniques, viral RNA was detected in blood, several weeks after the limit of infectious virus recovery.\n Finally, a recently developed strand-specific RT-PCR detected negative strand viral RNA, indicative of actively replicating virus, in

the nasopharynx plays a key role in the pathogenesis of AOM.\n Suppression of this inflammatory process might prevent the development of AOM as a complication.\n Objective: We sought to assess the effect of intranasally administered fluticasone propionate on prevention of AOM during a viral respiratory infection.\n Methods: A total of 210 children (mean age, 2.1 years; range, 0.7-3.9 years) with normal middle ear status and URI of 48 hours’ duration or less were randomly allocated to receive either fluticasone (100 ?g twice daily) or placebo for 7 days.\n The specific viral cause of the infection was determined from nasopharyngeal aspirates obtained at the first visit.\n The children were re-examined at the end of the 7-day medication period.\n Results: In the fluticasone group AOM developed in 40 (38.1%) of 105 children compared with 29 (28.2%) of 103 children receiving placebo (P = .\n13).\n The viral cause of the respiratory infection was determined in 167 (86.1%) of 194 children from whom a nasopharyngeal aspirate was obtained.\n In children with rhinovirus infection, AOM developed significantly more often in the fluticasone group (45.7%) than in the placebo group (14.7%, P = .\n005).\n Conclusion: Intranasally administered fluticasone does not prevent the development of AOM during URI but may increase the incidence of AOM during rhinovirus infection.\n (J

pathogens involved.\n A 1?year study was undertaken on children hospitalized consecutively for acute respiratory infection in a Pediatric Department in Rome to characterize the viruses involved.\n Two hundred twenty?seven children were enrolled in the study with a diagnosis of asthma, bronchiolitis, bronchopneumonia, or laringo?tracheo bronchitis.\n A molecular approach was adopted using specific reverse transcription (RT)?PCR assays detecting 13 respiratory viruses including metapneumovirus (hMPV) and the novel coronaviruses NL63 and HKU1; most amplified fragments were sequenced to confirm positive results and differentiate the strain.\n Viral pathogens were detected in 97 samples (42.7%), with 4.8% of dual infections identified; respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was detected in 17.2% of children, followed by rhinovirus (9.7%), parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV3) (7.5%), and influenza type A (4.4%).\n Interestingly, more than half the patients (9/17) that have rhinovirus as the sole respiratory pathogen had pneumonia.\n HMPV infected children below 3 years in two peaks in March and June causing bronchiolitis and pneumonia.\n One case of NL63 infection is described, documenting NL63 circulation in central Italy.\n In conclusion, the use of a comprehensive number of PCR?based tests is recommended to define the burden of viral pathogens in patients with respiratory tract infection.\n J.\n Med.\n Virol.\n 79:463–468, 2007. © 2007 Wiley?Liss, Inc.\n","id":"PMC7166338","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Wiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley

infections is not clear.\n\n\nObjectives\nTo describe the clinical characteristics of multiple viral infections versus single infection by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in hospitalized infants.\n\n\nStudy design\nThis is a prospective study conducted in all infants under 2 years of age admitted for acute respiratory infection (September 2000–June 2003) in a secondary teaching hospital.\n\n Virological diagnosis was made by two different multiplex reverse transcription-nested polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays in nasopharyngeal aspirates.\n\n We describe the clinical characteristics of the patients with multiple viral infections and compare them to a group of 86 randomly selected patients infected only with RSV.\n\n\nResults\n749 specimens taken were analyzed.\n\n Respiratory viruses were detected in 65.9% of the samples.\n\n 86 children had multiple viral infections (17.4% of all positive specimens).\n\n The most frequent clinical diagnosis in this group was recurrent wheezing in 44% and bronchiolitis in 52%.\n\n Fever was significantly more frequent (p &lt; 0.001), hospital stays were longer (p = 0.05), and antibiotic treatment was used more (p = 0.03) in infants with multiple viral infections than in the RSV-infected group.\n\n\nConclusions\nMultiple viral infections are frequent in hospitalized children with respiratory tract disease (17.4%).\n\n

seasonality of respiratory viral infections in hospitalized children in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia: a retrospective study of 27 years","abstract":"Background\nViral respiratory tract infections (RTI) are relatively understudied in Southeast Asian tropical countries.\n\n In temperate countries, seasonal activity of respiratory viruses has been reported, particularly in association with temperature, while inconsistent correlation of respiratory viral activity with humidity and rain is found in tropical countries.\n\n A retrospective study was performed from 1982-2008 to investigate the viral etiology of children (? 5 years old) admitted with RTI in a tertiary hospital in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.\n\n\nMethods\nA total of 10269 respiratory samples from all children ? 5 years old received at the hospital's diagnostic virology laboratory between 1982-2008 were included in the study.\n\n Immunofluorescence staining (for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A and B, parainfluenza types 1-3, and adenovirus) and virus isolation were performed.\n\n The yearly hospitalization rates and annual patterns of laboratory-confirmed viral RTIs were determined.\n\n Univariate ANOVA was used to analyse the demographic parameters of cases.\n\n Multiple regression and Spearman's rank correlation were used to analyse the correlation between RSV cases and meteorological parameters.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 2708 cases were laboratory-confirmed using immunofluorescence assays and viral cultures, with the most commonly detected being RSV (1913, 70.6%), parainfluenza viruses (357, 13.2%), influenza viruses (297, 11.0%), and adenovirus (141, 5.2%).\n\n Children infected with RSV were significantly younger, and children infected with influenza viruses were significantly older.\n\n The four main viruses caused disease throughout the year, with a seasonal peak observed for RSV in September-December.\n\n Monthly RSV cases were directly correlated with rain days, and inversely correlated with relative humidity and temperature.\n\n\nConclusion\nViral RTIs, particularly due to RSV, are commonly detected in respiratory samples from hospitalized children in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.\n\n As in temperate countries, RSV infection in tropical Malaysia also caused seasonal yearly epidemics, and this has implications for prophylaxis and vaccination programmes.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3337250","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

antigen tests and conventional cell culture for respiratory virus detection","abstract":"Background and objectives\nConventional cell culture (CC) has limited clinical utility as a result of the extended incubation period often required for virus isolation.\n\n Alternative methodologies have been introduced in an effort to improve turnaround times.\n\n One such system, the R-mix™ shell vial is discussed herein.\n\n The study objectives were: (a) to establish R-mix™ testing parameters as compared to direct antigen testing (DAT) and CC, and (b) to assess technical aspects and cost of R-mix™ in a high volume clinical virology laboratory.\n\n\nStudy design\nA prospective analysis of respiratory samples submitted to the clinical virology laboratory between November 2004 and April 2005 was performed.\n\n All specimens were inoculated onto R-mix™ shell vials (SV) and CC tubes; and a subset also underwent DAT for influenza A and B and/or RSV.\n\n A retrospective estimated cost analysis was made.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 563 samples were included in the study, which collectively revealed a total of 207 viruses.\n\n Sensitivity of R-mix™ for seven major respiratory viruses ranged from 45% to 83% compared to CC and DAT, while mean time to detection (TTD) varied from 1.1 to 1.4 days.\n\n In addition to these viruses, 23 picornaviruses, 11 CMV isolates and 5 HSV isolates were detected by CC alone.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe R-mix™ system has similar sensitivity as CC for the detection of parainfluenza 1–3 and influenza A/B while dramatically reducing the TTD.\n\n Furthermore, it is significantly more sensitive and produces more timely results for RSV than CC; yet, neither method offers a diagnostic benefit over rapid DAT for RSV detection.\n\n The sensitivity of R-mix™ for adenovirus appears to be significantly lower than that of CC.\n\n Lastly, methodologies other than R-mix™ must remain in place under circumstances where identification of other potential viral respiratory pathogens, including herpesviruses and picornaviruses, is desired.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7108409","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier B.V.","authors":[{"firstname":"P.

pandemic influenza A (H1N1) were obtained from the China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention.\n The spatiotemporal distribution patterns of cases were characterized through spatial analysis.\n The impact of travel-related risk factors on invasion of the disease was analyzed using survival analysis, and climatic factors related to local transmission were identified using multilevel Poisson regression, both at the county level.\n The results showed that the epidemic spanned a large geographic area, with the most affected areas being in western China.\n Significant differences in incidence were found among age groups, with incidences peaking in school-age children.\n Overall, the epidemic spread from southeast to northwest.\n Proximity to airports and being intersected by national highways or freeways but not railways were variables associated with the presence of the disease in a county.\n Lower temperature and lower relative humidity were the climatic factors facilitating local transmission after correction for the effects of school summer vacation and public holidays, as well as population density and the density of medical facilities.\n These findings indicate that interventions focused on domestic travel, population density, and climatic factors could play a role in mitigating the public health impact of future influenza pandemics.\n","id":"PMC3339311","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Oxford University

It will also provide clinicians with helpful information about the etiological patterns of outpatients presenting with complaints of acute respiratory syndrome, but further studies should be conducted, and longer-term laboratory-based surveillance would give a better picture of the etiology of ILI.\nIntroduction\nInfluenza-like illness (ILI), a subset of acute respiratory infections (ARI), represents approximately 62% of acute respiratory infections. Viral pathogens are the most significant contributors.ARI is caused by many viruses, including the following: influenza viruses (IAV, IBV and ICV), respiratory syncytial virus(RSV),rhinovirus(HRV), human parainfluenza viruses(HPIV)1-4, human metapneumovirus(HMPV), human coronaviruses (HCoV) NL63,229E,OC43, and HKU1, human enterovirus (HEV) and adenovirus(HADV).The similar clinical presentations of patients infected by various respiratory viruses make etiological diagnoses difficult when physicians simply make decisions based only on physical symptoms. The etiology of influenza-like illness (ILI) has been well characterized in some parts of the world, especially in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.However, much less is known about the etiology of ILI in China, especially in Southeast China, which is located in a temperate region.\nPudong New Area is the largest and most developed district in Shanghai, with an extremely dense population of 5.5 million in 2013, representing one-fifth of the population of Shanghai. Shanghai Dongfang Hospital and Shanghai Zhoupu Hospital have been national influenza surveillance sentinel units since 2007. As in other regions of China, ILI data from hospitals can provide valuable information that could be used for monitoring the onset of an epidemic, especially the circulation of influenza virus. However, the epidemiology in Pudong of viral etiology for ILI is poorly understood. With support from the Chinese Key SciTech Program for Infection Control(under The Twelfth Five-year Framework), a laboratory-based influenza-like illness surveillance system was established in 2011 in Pudong New Area. We adapted multiplex RT-PCR assays for the detection of influenza virus and a number of other respiratory viruses that have recently been introduced, and these assays are also more sensitive than culture. The objective of this study was to examine the clinical and etiological characteristics of influenza-like illness (ILI) in outpatients in this area from January 2011 through December 2013.\nMaterials and Methods\nEthics statement\nThis study did not involve any health-related patient interventions. The surveillance and sampling protocols were approved by Shanghai Pudong New Area Center for Disease Control and Prevention Review Board. A verbal informed consent was obtained from each subject; however, the patient identities have not been disclosed at any stage. The institutional board was informed of the specific needs with reference to the study setting and approved this mode of consent. A check box was included in the data form to document the consent-taking procedure.\nCase definition and study population\nAn ILI case was defined as a sudden onset of fever(&gt;=38 C), cough and/or sore throat, with no laboratory-confirmed evidence of etiology.A co-infection was diagnosed when a patient tested positive for two viruses on RT-PCR. The study population, including children (&lt;15 years) and adults (&gt;=15 years),consisted of the ILI cases who sought medical attention in the outpatient fever clinics of the above mentioned two hospitals from January 2011 to December 2013.\nSpecimens and data collection\nFive to ten ILI cases per hospital who had not received antiviral drugs were invited to participate in this study each week. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected by well-trained nurses. The swabs were sent in 3 ml of viral transport medium to Pudong New Area Center for Disease Control and Prevention within 48 hrs after collection and were stored at -70 C. Data were collected simultaneously using a standardized case report form, which included both demography and clinical information (such as symptoms, treatment, and temperature).\nNucleic acid extraction\nNucleic acid was extracted by the NucliSens easy MAG platform with the NucliSens magnetic extraction reagents (bio Me rieux, The Netherlands) according to the manufacturer's instructions using a sample volume of 250mul. The elution volume of nucleic acid was 50mul.\ncDNA synthesis\nReverse transcription was performed with an ABI 9700 GeneAmp PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Singapore) using the first-strand cDNA synthesis reagents (Ferments, Germany), according to the Seeplex RV12 ACE Detection Kit's user manual (Seegene Inc., Seoul, Korea). The final reaction volume was 20mul with 8mul total RNA, 1mul random hexamer (0.2mug/mul), 3mul nuclease-free water, 4mul 5xRT buffer, 2mul 10 mM dNTP, 1mul Rnase inhibitor (20 u/mul), and 1mul reverse transcriptase (200 u/mul). The reaction was chilled on ice for 2 min, run at 37 C for 90 min, 94 C for 2 min and chilled on ice for 2 min. All cDNA samples were stored at -20 C until use.\nRT-PCR and Real-time PCR\nPCR amplification was performed with an ABI 9700 GeneAmp PCR system using a Seeplex RV12 ACE Detection Kit. It is designed for simultaneous detection of 12 respiratory viruses, including IAV, IBV, RSVA, RSVB, HADV, HMPV, HPIV1-3, HRV, HCoV-229E/NL63, and HCoV-OC43/HKU1. Sample cDNAs were tested in a 2-tube reaction following the protocol supplied by the manufacturer. HMPV, HADV, HCoV-229E/NL63, HPIV-2, HPIV-3 and HPIV-1 were detected by set A. IAV IBV, HCoV-OC43HKU1, HRV-A/B, RSV-A, and RSV-B were detected by set B. Positive controls included a mixture of all 12 virus clones. The negative control contained only ddH2O. Each set consisted of 4mul 5xRV12 ACE PM (A or B), 3mul 8-Mop Solution, 10mul 2xMultiplex Master Mix and 3mul of the sample's cDNA. The PCR reaction program was 94 C for 15 min, 40 cycles of 94 C for 0.5 min, 60 C for 1.5 min and 72 C for 1.5 min, with extension at 72 C for 10 min.\nReal-time PCR for human influenza C (IFVC) and human bocavirus(HBoV) was performed using an Influenza Virus C Real Time RT-PCR kit (Shanghai ZJ Bio-Tech Co., Ltd., People's Republic of China)and a Diagnostic Kit for Human Bocavirus DNA (GuangzhouDAAN Gene Co., Ltd., People's Republic of China). In accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, PCR for ICV was performed in a volume of 25mul using ABI 7500 fast (ABI, USA). Each reaction consisted of 19mul IFVC Super Mix, 1mul RT-PCR Enzyme Mix and 5mul Extraction RNA template for a final volume of 25mul. The PCR reaction was performed in the instrument at 45 C for 10 minutes (min), and 95 C for 15 min, followed by amplification consisting of 40 cycles of 15 seconds (s) at 95 C and 1 min at 60 C. Positive and no-template controls were included in each run.PCR for HBoV was performed in a volume of 20mul using ABI 7500 fast. Each reaction consisted of 14mul HBoV PCR Reaction Mix, 0.7mul Enzyme Mix, 3.3mul Primer and Probe Mix and2mul Extraction DNA template for a final volume of 20mul. The PCR reaction was performed in the instrument at50 C for 8 min, 93 C for 2 min, 10 cycles of 45 s at 93 C and 1 min at 55 C, followed by amplification consisting of 30 cycles of 30 s at 93 C and 45 se at 55 C. Positive and no-template controls were included in each run.\nElectrophoresis\nPCR products were sized using QIAxcel DNA Screening gel cartridge (QIAGEN) on the QIAxcel system (QIAGEN, Switzerland), which enabled high-resolution capillary electrophoresis. A 50-800 bp QX DNA Size Marker (Qiagen) was included on QIAxcel runs, and the size of the products was determined using the QIAxcel ScreenGel software (Qiagen). The QIAxcel system produces a digital gel image and an electropherogram for fragment analysis. The expected PCR product sizes of set A were 749bp (HMPV), 534 bp (HADV), 375 bp (HCOV-229E/NL63), 264 bp (HPIV-2), 188 bp HPIV-3), and 139 bp (HPIV-1), while the product sizes of set B were 754 bp (IFV-B), 578 bp (HCOV-OC43/HKU1), 394 bp (HRV-A/B), 273 bp (HRSV-A), 206 bp (IFV-A) and 143 bp (HRSV-B).\nStatistical Analysis\nData were collected by the staff of the sentinel hospitals and laboratories on a standardized case report form and entered into an online data management system established by China CDC. The data were analyzed with SPSS software. The mean and SD or median and IQR were calculated for continuous variables, and percentages were calculated for categorical variables. A Pearson chi-square test and one-way ANOVA were used for categorical data or continuous data, respectively, wherever appropriate. A multivariate unconditional logistic regression analysis was used to determine factors associated with various clinical signs of ILI in outpatients. All statistical tests were 2-sided. P values&lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant.\nResults and Discussion\nClinical characteristics of the ILI case-outpatients\nA total of 1970 ILL outpatients who met the ILI-case definition criteria were enrolled in this study. Of these outpatients, 51.8% were male. The mean age was 19.7+-16.9 years. A temperature reading of &gt;39 C was documented in 262(13.3%) of the subjects. A total of 67.9% of the subjects reported a cough, 51% pharyngalgia, 40.5% running nose, 32.4% fatigue, 28.2% headache, and 7.6% myalgia. Patients infected with influenza virus experienced higher temperatures and more coughs, running noses, headaches and fatigue than patients infected with other viruses or patients who were virus-free(p &lt;0.001) (Table 1).\nClinical characteristics of ILI-outpatients in Shanghai from January 2011 to December 2013.\nCharacteristics	Influenza virus-positive	Other virus-positive *	virus-negative	P value	Total#	 	n = 393	n = 245	n = 1332	n = 1970	 	Demographics						 	Male	185(47.1%)	129(52.7%)	706(53%)	0.113	1020(51.8%)	 	age(y)(means+-SD)	24.2+-18.0	17.4+-17.8	18.8+-16.1	&lt;0.001	19.7+-16.9	 	Clinical	 	Presentation	 	Temperature( C)&gt;=39 C	79(20.2% of 391)	23(9.4% of 245)	79(5.9% of 1329)	&lt;0.001	262(13.3% of 1965)	 	Cough	320(81.4%)	174(71.0%)	843(63.3%)	&lt;0.001	1337(67.9%)	 	Sore throat	214(54.5%)	133(54.3%)	658(49.4%)	0.117	1005(51.0%)	 	Running rose	200(50.9%)	109(44.5%)	489(35.7%)	&lt;0.001	798(40.5%)	 	Headache	139(35.4%)	60(24.5%)	357(26.8%)	0.002	556(28.2%)	 	Fatigue	161(41.0%)	67(27.3%)	410(30.8%)	&lt;0.001	638(32.4%)	 	Interval (days)	1(0-1)	1(0-1)	1(0-1)	0.605	1(0-1)	 	Routine examination						 	White cell count(x109/l)	8.84+-11.97(n = 358)	8.49+-5.20(n = 219)	8.27+-7.15(n = 1213)	0.496	8.41+-8.16(n = 1790)	 	Percentage of neutrophis(%)	60.81+-18.91(n = 351)	59.4+-18.47(n = 216)	59.4+-18.12(n = 1192)	0.439	59.7+-18.32(n = 1759)	 	Percentage of lymphocytes (%)	25.5+-22.7(n = 339)	29.1+-20.0(n = 211)	28.5+-19.6(n = 1162)	0.038	27.9+-20.3(n = 1712)	 	\nValues are mean with SD or n (%) of outpatients unless otherwise stated.

All of the 12 respiratory viruses were detected. At least one agent was detected in 638 specimens (32.4%) by multiplex RT-PCR. The viruses most commonly detected were influenza A virus (IAV) and influenza B virus (IBV) at 230 (11.7%) and 162 (8.2%), respectively. All of the others were present at a frequency less than 4%: HRV in 61(3.1%) patients, HADV in 53(2.7%) patients, HCoV in 51(2.6%) patients, HPIV in 48(2.4%) patients, RSV in 47(2.3%) patients, HMPV in 5(0.3%) patients, and HBoV in 2(0.1%) patients (Table 2)A single infection was identified in 616 (31.3%) patients, and co-infection was observed in 22 (1.1%). There were 14 cases with co-infection in children less than 15 years of age, not significantly different (p &gt;0.05) from the corresponding result for adults(&gt;=15)(Table 3).Of the 22 co-infection specimens, the most frequent combination was IAV and HRV (n = 6), followed by IAV and HPIV, IBV and HCoV, HPIV and HCoV, RSV and HPIV, RSV and HCoV. Each of these combinations was observed in two cases. The combinations IBV and HRV, HPIV and HRV, RSV and HRV, RSV and HADV, IBV and HPIV, and HRV and HCoV were each observed in one case.\nDistributions of agents detected in respiratory samples in Shanghai Pudong, January 2011 through December 2013.\nMonth	Total samples	No.(%) of isolates	 	IAV	IBV	ICV	HPIV-1	HPIV-2	HPIV-3	RSV-A	RSV-B	HCOV-OC43/HKU1	HCOV-229E/NL63	HADV	HRV-A/B	HMPV	HBoV	 	Jan-11	42	21(50.0)	3(7.1)	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	 	Feb-11	46	2(4.3)	6(13.0)	0	1(2.2)	0	0	1(2.2)	0	1(2.2)	0	2(4.3)	0	0	0	 	Mar-11	44	0	17(38.6)	0	0	0	1(2.3)	0	0	1(2.3)	0	2(4.6)	0	0	0	 	Apr-11	30	0	5(16.7)	0	2(6.6)	0	0	0	0	0	0	3(10)	0	0	0	 	May-11	39	0	3(7.6)	1(2.6)	2(5.2)	0	3(7.6)	0	0	0	0	4(10.3)	0	0	0	 	Jun-11	32	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	2(6.3)	0	0	0	 	Jul-11	44	0	2(4.5)	0	0	0	1(2.3)	0	0	1(2.3)	0	3(6.8)	0	0	0	 	Aug-11	72	0	2(2.8)	0	2(2.8)	1(1.4)	1(1.4)	0	0	3(4.2)	1(1.4)	3(4.2)	0	0	0	 	Sep-11	88	0	3(3.4)	0	4(4.5)	4(4.5)	0	2(2.3)	4(4.5)	5(5.7)	11(12.6)	0	0	0	0	 	Oct-11	89	0	0	0	1(1.1)	2(2.2)	0	12(13.6)	0	0	4(4.5)	2(2.2)	0	0	0	 	Nov-11	28	0	3(10.7)	0	1(3.6)	2(7.1)	0	1(3.6)	0	0	0	2(7.1)	0	0	0	 	Dec-11	6	0	5(83.3)	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	 	Jan-12	145	0	53(36.6)	0	0	0	0	2(1.4)	0	0	1(0.7)	4(2.8)	0	0	0	 	Feb-12	120	9(7.5)	43(35.8)	0	0	0	0	2(1.7)	0	0	0	1(1.7)	1(1.7)	0	0	 	Mar-12	109	18(16.5)	14(12.8)	0	1(0.9)	0	0	2(1.8)	2(1.8)	1(0.9)	1(0.9)	2(1.8)	3(2.8)	0	0	 	Apr-12	79	12(15.2)	0	0	3(3.8)	0	0	0	1(1.3)	0	3(3.8)	3(3.8)	2(2.5)	1(1.3)	0	 	May-12	89	4(4.5)	1(1.1)	0	0	0	1(1.1)	1(1.1)	0	0	5(5.6)	0	4(4.5)	0	0	 	Jun-12	81	3(3.7)	2(2.5)	0	0	0	0	0	0	2(2.5)	3(3.7)	0	5(6.2)	1(1.2)	0	 	Jul-12	118	63(53.4)	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1(0.8)	3(2.5)	0	5(4.2)	2(1.7)	0	 	Aug-12	57	16(28.2)	0	0	0	0	0	1(1.7)	0	0	0	0	1(1.7)	0	1(1.7)	 	Sep-12	49	5(10.2)	0	0	0	0	0	2(4.1)	0	0	0	0	6(12.2)	0	0	 	Oct-12	46	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	6(13.0)	0	0	 	Nov-12	48	0	0	0	0	0	0	1(2.1)	3(6.3)	0	3(6.3)	0	8(16.6)	0	0	 	Dec-12	74	17(22.8)	0	0	0	0	0	0	5(6.8)	0	0	1(1.4)	3(4.1)	0	0	 	Jan-13	72	11(15.3)	0	0	0	0	0	0	4(5.6)	0	0	5(6.9)	1(1.4)	0	0	 	Feb-13	19	5(26.3)	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1(5.3)	0	0	 	Mar-13	20	6(30.0)	0	0	0	1(5.0)	0	0	0	0	0	1(5.0)	2(10.0)	0	0	 	Apr-13	19	3(15.8)	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	3(15.8)	2(10.5)	0	0	 	May-13	26	2(7.7)	0	0	1(3.9)	1(3.9)	2(7.6)	1(3.9)	0	0	0	1(3.8)	4(15.4)	0	0	 	Jun-13	16	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1(6.3)	2(12.5)	0	0	 	Jul-13	51	5(9.8)	0	0	1(2.0)	3(5.9)	1(2.0)	0	0	0	0	4(7.8)	0	0	0	 	Aug-13	52	2(3.9)	0	0	1(1.9)	1(1.9)	0	0	0	0	0	2(3.8)	1(1.9)	0	0	 	Sep-13	38	2(5.3)	0	0	2(5.3)	1(2.6)	0	0	0	1(2.6)	0	1(2.6)	4(10.5)	1(2.6)	0	 	Oct-13	18	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	 	Nov-13	26	6(23.1)	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1(3.8)	0	0	0	 	Dec-13	38	18(47.4)	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	12.6)	 	Total	1970	230(11.7)	162(8.2)	1(0.05)	22(1.1)	16(0.8)	10(0.5)	28(1.4)	19(1.0)	16(0.8)	35(1.8)	53(2.7)	61(3.1)	5(0.3)	2(0.1)	 	\nIAV: Influenza A virus;

The monthly distribution of viruses is shown in Fig. 1A, 1B, 1C and 1D. We observed a winter peak in the detection rate in ILI patients during 3 years of surveillance and a summer peak in 2012. Influenza virus was the most commonly detected agent in the three winter seasons (i.e., 2010/2011, 2011/2012 and 2012/2013) and in one summer season (2012)(Fig. 1A and 1B). The results showed that IAV and IBV circulated from year to year in Shanghai (Fig. 1B).\nMonthly percentage of ILI outpatients positive for viral etiology in Shanghai, 2011-2013.\nA shows the monthly percentage of ILI outpatients positive for influenza virus, non-influenza virus and positive for any one of the studied respiratory viruses. B shows the monthly percentage of ILI outpatients positive for influenza subtypes. C shows the monthly percentage of ILI outpatients positive for HRV, HADV and HCoV. D shows the monthly percentage of ILI outpatients positive for HPIV, RSV and other respiratory viruses.\nHRV (not detected in 2011) was the second most frequently detected viral agent presenting during 2012 and 2013. It peaked in September-November in 2012 but showed no seasonality in 2013(Fig. 1C).HADV and HCoV were other major viral pathogens of ILI. HADV infection presented predominantly in 2011 and 2013, while HCoV presented predominantly in 2011 and 2012, and one peak was observed in September (Fig. 1C). HPIV, RSV, and HMPV appeared sporadically during the study period but presented an epidemic peak in September-October of 2011(Fig. 1D). The results suggested that multiple respiratory viruses may circulate concurrently in the population and cause a large proportion (approximately 40%) of ILI.\nGender and age distribution of respiratory viral etiology\nThe distribution of respiratory viral pathogens from confirmed cases tested by RT-PCR by age and gender is shown in Table 3. Respiratory viruses were detected in 314(49.2%) of the male patients and 324(50.8%) of the female patients. There was no gender difference in susceptibility to ILI in Shanghai (Table 3).\nIAV and IBV were most frequently identified in all age groups. The proportion of samples positive for IAV was higher in subjects 15-24 and 25-59 years of age (44.0%, and 41.8%, respectively) than in other age groups. This difference was statistically significant (p = 0.001).HCoV-229Eand HCoV-OC43 were detected frequently (13.3%, and 7.6%, respectively) in children less than 5 years of age. These values differed significantly from the corresponding values for other age groups (p = 0.002 and p = 0.01, respectively).HPMV and HBoV were only detected among subjects less than 15 years of age. HPIV was detected more frequently in subjects&gt;=60 years of age compared with other age groups, but the difference between these frequencies was not statistically significant (Table 3).\nFactors Associated with Clinical Signs of ILI\nThe odds of having symptoms of cough, sore throat, running nose, fatigue, headache and temperature &gt;39 C were higher in influenza virus-infected outpatients than in others, with odds ratios [ORs] of 1.99, 95% CI 1.60-2.47, p&lt;0.001; 1.22, 95% CI 1.01-1.48,p = 0.038; 1.62, 95%CI 1.34-1.96, p&lt;0.001; 1.25, 95%CI 1.02-1.53, p = 0.028; 1.24, 95%CI 1.01-1.52; and 1.40, 95%CI1.07-1.83, p = 0.015, respectively. Compared with the odds in patients &gt;=5 years of age, the odds of having a cough or running nose were higher for those in other age groups(OR3.22,95% CI 2.34-4.42; p&lt;0.001;1.90,95% CI1.50-2.41,p&lt;0.001,respectively). However, the odds of having a sore throat, fatigue or headache were higher for patients &gt;=5 years of age (OR2.56, 95%CI2.0-3.23, p&lt;0.001; 50, 95%CI 20-100, p&lt;0.001; and 100, 95%CI 20-333, p&lt;0.001, respectively (Table 4).\nResults of multivariate analyses for factors associated with 6 clinical signs of virus positive in outpatients, Shanghai, China*, 2011-2013.\n	Clinical sign of ILI .

The Seeplex Respiratory Virus Detection assay (Seegene Inc., Seoul, Korea) was introduced to the respiratory research community in 2007 and can efficiently differentiate 12 respiratory viruses. The application of multiplex design RT-PCR allows the simultaneous detection of multiple infections. In our study, multiplex viral agents, including IV (A and B), RSV (A and B), HPIV1-3, HRV, HCoVs (229E and OC43), HADV and HMPV were analyzed in a large population with ILI. To our knowledge, this is the first study of respiratory virus etiology with ILI in both children and adults in Shanghai. The overall detection rate of respiratory virus was 32.4%in the 3 years of laboratory-based surveillance. All of the 12 respiratory viruses were detected. Influenza virus was the most commonly detected agent in both children and adults; other viruses were present at a frequency less than 4.0%.\nWe observed a winter peak in the detection rate in ILI patients during 3 years of surveillance and a summer peak in 2012.Similar results have been reported in other studies in South China. However, the ILI incidence only peaked during winter in Beijing and North China. HCoV, HADV, and HRV were more frequently detected in children than in adults; HMPV and HBoV were only detected in children less than 15 years of age. Coughs, sore throats, running noses, fatigue, headache and temperatures &gt;39 C were higher in influenza virus-infected outpatients than other respiratory virus-infected patients.\nIn our study, the investigation of the clinical characteristics of ILI showed that patients with IV experienced more coughs and temperatures &gt;39 C than patients with other respiratory virus or those who were virus free. This result is consistent with the findings of previous research.\nChildren less than 5 years of age experienced more coughs, running noses and temperatures &gt;39 C than adults. In the study by Friedman and Attia, the symptom triad of cough, headache, and pharyngitis was found to be a predictor of isolation of influenza virus in febrile children who were selected from emergency department patients at a tertiary pediatric center according to predetermined criteria indicating influenza infection. Respiratory viruses can cause influenza symptoms. There is inconsistency about whether certain symptoms can be used to distinguish specific infections, and it is generally accepted that there are no symptoms specific to any viral infection. Some other studies have attempted to identify signs or symptoms specifically associated with influenza virus or other viruses, but no definitive conclusions have been drawn.\nDuring the study period, 32.4% of the specimens were positive for at least one virus. This result is consistent with the results of several previous studies that found percentages between 27-34.6%, but it is lower than those reported by several investigators who found percentages between 48.7-59.5%. There are multiple explanations for these differences. The differences could be due to true differences in the overall burden, to differences among study populations, or to detection methods that differed from among studies. It is difficult to compare the results, as the reported data were obtained with different detection methods or PCR primers. Future comparative studies to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of these detection methods should clarify this issue. Second, the infection rates may vary with geographical location and with the particular period chosen for testing. Third, the patient population and its environment may influence the results. In our study, up to 1332 specimens were negative in RT-PCR although all of them matched well with the inclusion criteria for ILI. Negative findings could have resulted from the low load of viral material in samples, or to infection with bacteria or other viruses such as enterovirus.\nThe seasonal pattern of ILI cases in Shanghai was quite unique according to our study.\nResults differ markedly among studies in terms of the respiratory viruses most commonly found among studies. As in many previous studies, influenza A and B virus were the most commonly detected viral pathogens in outpatients with ILI in our region. An epidemic of influenza virus usually occurs in the winter. However, an epidemic peak of IAV infection was observed in the summer of 2012. More patients with influenza-like illness were observed during this period. This result was consistent with the Chinese National Influenza Center (CNIC) (2012 2013) China flu Weekly Report. In addition, HRV, RSV, HADV, HCoV, HPIV and HMPV were identified from outpatient specimens and contributed collectively to 38.4% of all ILI laboratory-confirmed cases in our study. The detection rate of influenza virus was significantly higher among adult patients, whereas other viruses, such as HADV, HCoV, and HMPV, were prevalent among children less than 15 years of age. These findings are consistent with reports from other studies.\nHRV was not present in 2011, but it was the second most frequently detected viral agent in both children and adults in 2012 and 2013, representing approximately 10% of all positive cases. The positive rate (3.1%) was lower than that found by previous studies, which detected HRV in 10% to &gt;40% of respiratory infections. HRV may circulate year-round in our region, a result found by previous studies. RSV-positive samples occurred at a low level in our study. This finding contrasts with other studies, where the predominant virus detected in children less than 5 years of age was RSV. The reason for this difference is that we did not include hospitalized children, as RSV has been shown to be a common cause of lower respiratory tract infection in children admitted to the hospital. Previous studies on RSV infections have primarily been conducted in hospitalized elderly adults with medical conditions such as cardiopulmonary diseases that may predispose them to viral infections that are relatively uncommon in the general population.\nIn our study, a total of 22 samples (3.5% of the total number of RT-PCR positive cases) revealed the presence of co-infections. In co-infection cases, influenza A virus, PIV, and RSV were found together most frequently, at rates of 36.4% (8/22). Previous studies have reported that co-infections were associated with more severe signs than mono-infections. Children were found to be more likely to be co-infected than adults in the present study. However, the subsequent clinical conditions of ILI illness patients were not obtained, and thus the association between co-infections and severe signs cannot be analyzed. We will address such research themes in the future.\nThis study has limitations. First, no testing for other etiologies (such as enterovirus or bacteria) of acute respiratory illness was performed. As is generally known, respiratory viruses, bacteria and other microorganisms can cause respiratory illness with influenza-like symptoms. Without doubt, other microorganisms could have been additional pathogens in the negative specimens, and our results may underestimate the role of virus infection. Second, the histories of influenza vaccine in ILI outpatients were not obtained. Thus, the analysis of clinical characteristics in ILI patients may be biased. Third, we did not collect all ILI cases presenting at the above two sentinel sites from Monday through Sunday. Facility staffs were involved in the project on a voluntary basis, with frequent shifts of personnel to other facilities.\nIn conclusion, the spectrum, seasonality, age distribution and clinical associations of respiratory virus infections in children and adults with influenza-like illness were analyzed in Shanghai for the first time in this study. To a certain extent, the findings can provide baseline data for evaluating the burden of respiratory virus infection in children and adults in Shanghai. It also can provide clinicians with helpful information about the etiological patterns of outpatients presenting with complaints of acute respiratory symptoms, but further studies should be conducted, and longer-term laboratory-based surveillance would give a better picture of the etiological characteristics of ILI.\nSupporting Information\nReferences\nSurveillance of respiratory pathogens and influenza-like illnesses in general practices:The Netherlands, winter 1997-98\nInfluenza and other respiratory viruses in three Central American countries\nHuman rhinoviruses: the cold wars resume\nLongitudinal molecular microbial analysis of influenza-like illness in New York City, May 2009 through May 2010\nSurveillance of community-acquired viral infections due to respiratory viruses in Rhone-Alpes (France) during winter 1994 to 1995\nEtiology and clinical characteristics of influenza-like illness (ILI) in outpatients in Beijing, June 2010 to May 2011\nViral causes of influenza-like illness: Insight from a study during the winters 2004-2007\nDevelopment of a respiratory virus panel test for detection of twenty human respiratory viruses by use of multiplex PCR and a fluid microbead-based assay\nRapid and sensitive method using multiplex real-time PCR for diagnosis of infections by influenza a and influenza B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, and parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, 3, and 4\nRapid detection and identification of 12 respiratory viruses using a dual priming oligonucleotide system-based multiplex PCR assay\nReview of an influenza surveillance system, Beijing, People's Republic of China\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention Overview of influenza surveillance in the United States, 2007 vol. 2014, 2014.\nRespiratory virus multiplex RT-PCR assay sensitivities and influence factors in hospitalized children with lower respiratory tract infections\nA novel multiplex real-time RT-PCR assay with FRET hybridization probes for the detection and quantitation of 13 respiratory viruses\nSurveillance of 16 respiratory viruses in patients with influenza-like illness in Nanjing, China\nClinical predictors of influenza in children\nAetiology of influenza-like illness in adults includes parainfluenzavirus type 4\nPredicting influenza infections during epidemics with use of a clinical case definition\nAccuracy of clinical diagnosis of influenza in outpatient children\nPrevalence of human respiratory viruses in adults with acute respiratory tract infections in Beijing, 2005-2007\nLaboratory diagnosis and surveillance of human respiratory viruses by PCR in Victoria, Australia, 2002-2003\nDetection and typing by molecular techniques of respiratory viruses in children hospitalized for acute respiratory infection in Rome, Italy\nJu X, Fang Q, Zhang J, Xu A, Liang L, Ke C.

metapneumovirus and bocavirus and emergent viruses including SARS-CoV have already been exhaustively scrutinized.\n\n The clinical impact of most respiratory NIVs is attributable to one or two major strains but there are 100+ distinct HRVs and, because we have never sought them independently, we must arbitrarily divide the literature's clinical impact findings among them.\n\n Early findings from

increased fever and respiratory ED visits among children younger than 5 y during respiratory syncytial virus-predominant periods preceding epidemic influenza; and excess ED visits across all ages during the 2003–2004 (9.2 excess visits per 1,000 population) and 2004–2005 (5.2 excess visits per 1,000 population) A/H3N2 Fujian-lineage epidemics, with the relative impact shifted within and between seasons from younger to older ages.\n\n During each influenza epidemic period in the study, ED visits were increased among school-aged children, and each epidemic peaked among school-aged children before other impacted age groups.\n\n\nConclusions\nInfluenza-related morbidity in NYC was highly age- and strain-specific.\n\n The impact of reemerging B/Victoria-lineage influenza was focused primarily on school-aged children born since the virus was last widespread in the US, while epidemic A/Fujian-lineage influenza affected all age groups, consistent with a novel antigenic variant.\n\n The correspondence between predominant circulating viruses and excess ED visits, hospitalizations, and deaths shows that excess fever and respiratory ED visits provide a reliable surrogate measure of incident influenza-attributable morbidity.\n\n The highly age-specific impact of influenza by subtype and strain suggests that greater age detail be incorporated into ongoing surveillance.\n\n Influenza morbidity surveillance using electronic data currently available in many jurisdictions can provide timely and representative information about the age-specific epidemiology of circulating influenza viruses.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1939858","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Donald R","surname":"Olson","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Richard T","surname":"Heffernan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Marc","surname":"Paladini","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kevin","surname":"Konty","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Don","surname":"Weiss","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Farzad","surname":"Mostashari","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Neil M","surname":"Ferguson","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Neil M","surname":"Ferguson","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1542/peds.112.6.1442","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Revised indications for the use of palivizumab and respiratory syncytial virus immune globulin intravenous for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus infections.","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Influenza B virus reinfection.","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.jclinepi.2004.08.014","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Influenza-like illness criteria were poorly related to laboratory-confirmed influenza in a sentinel surveillance study.","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Methods for current statistical analysis of excess-pneumonia-influenza deaths.","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1002/sim.4780080312","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Detection of aberrations in the occurrence of notifiable diseases surveillance data.","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1097/00001648-199707000-00007","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A method for timely assessment of influenza-associated mortality in the United States.","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.3201/eid0303.970322","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Using laboratory-based surveillance data for prevention: an algorithm for detecting Salmonella outbreaks.","abstract":"By applying cumulative sums (CUSUM), a quality control method commonly used in manufacturing, we constructed a process for detecting unusual clusters among reported laboratory isolates of disease-causing organisms.\n We developed a computer algorithm based on minimal adjustments to the CUSUM method, which cumulates sums of the differences between frequencies of isolates and their expected means;

community-acquired pneumonia occur every year—100 million in children and 100 million in adults.\n Molecular diagnostic tests have greatly increased our understanding of the role of viruses in pneumonia, and findings indicate that the incidence of viral pneumonia has been underestimated.\n In children, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, human bocavirus, and parainfluenza viruses are the agents identified most frequently in both developed and developing countries.\n Dual viral infections are common, and a third of children have evidence of viral-bacterial co-infection.\n In adults, viruses are the putative causative agents in a third of cases of community-acquired pneumonia, in particular influenza viruses, rhinoviruses, and coronaviruses.\n Bacteria continue to have a predominant role in adults with pneumonia.\n Presence of viral epidemics in the community, patient's age, speed of onset of illness, symptoms, biomarkers, radiographic changes, and response to treatment can help differentiate viral from bacterial pneumonia.\n However, no clinical algorithm exists that will distinguish clearly the cause of pneumonia.\n No clear consensus has been reached about whether patients with obvious viral community-acquired pneumonia need to be treated with antibiotics.\n Apart from neuraminidase inhibitors for pneumonia caused by influenza viruses, there is no clear role for use of specific antivirals to treat viral community-acquired pneumonia.\n Influenza vaccines are the only available specific preventive measures.\n Further studies are needed to better understand the cause and pathogenesis of community-acquired pneumonia.\n Furthermore, regional differences in cause of pneumonia should be investigated, in particular to obtain more

swabs were collected from outpatients during medical visits for influenza?like illness and were tested for 16 respiratory viruses using PCR.\n Three hundred seventeen viruses were detected in samples from 246 (50.6%) patients with influenza?like illness.\n The viruses found mostly commonly were influenza, rhinovirus, hCoV HKU1, and adenovirus.\n The identification rates of respiratory viruses differed significantly among different sampling seasons (P?=?0.0002).\n The rates of influenza A and hCoV HKU1 were much higher during the influenza?like illness winter peak than during the influenza?like illness summer peak and other months.\n Co?infections were detected in 57 (11.7%) patients and were found most commonly in adults older than 60 years.\n RSV was detected in 5.9% and 2.6% of patients who were 0–5 and 6–15 years old, respectively, but was not detected in other age groups.\n This study confirmed that multiple respiratory viruses may circulate concurrently in the

conducted in Beijing, China, from May 2005 to July 2007. Nose and throat swab samples from 5808 ARTI patients were analysed by PCR methods for common respiratory viruses, including influenza viruses (IFVs) A, B, and C, parainfluenza viruses (PIVs) 1–4, enteroviruses (EVs), human rhinoviruses (HRVs), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human coronaviruses (HCoVs) OC43, 229E, NL63, and HKU1, and adenoviruses (ADVs).\n Viral pathogens were detected in 34.6% of patient samples, and 1.6% of the patients tested positive for more than one virus.\n IFVs (19.3%) were the dominant agents detected, followed by HRVs (6.5%), PIVs (4.3%), EVs (3.2%), and HCoVs (1.1%).\n ADVs, RSV and HMPV were also detected (&lt;1%).\n The viral detection rates differed significantly between infections of the lower and upper respiratory tracts in the sample population: PIVs, the second most commonly detected viral agents in lower acute respiratory tract infections (LRTIs), were more prevalent than in upper acute respiratory tract infections, indicating that the pathogenic role of PIVs in LRTIs should be investigated.\n Currently, this study is the largest?scale investigation of respiratory virus infections in China with

A single virus was detected in 373 patients (45.7%), and two to four viruses in 113 patients (13.8%).\n\n The most frequent causative viruses were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (24.7%), human bocavirus (24.5%), and human rhinovirus (HRV) (15%).\n\n RSV was more prevalent in winter and among young infants.\n\n Cases of seasonal influenza A and B viruses were reported mainly in January and August.\n\n An increase in adenovirus infection was observed during the spring of the second year of the study.\n\n Sequence analyses showed multiple introductions of different virus subtypes and identified a high prevalence of the newly defined HRV-C species.\n\n A higher viral incidence was observed during the winter of 2008, which was unusually cold.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis study supports the usefulness of multiplex RT-PCR for virus detection and co-infection, and for implementation of a molecular monitoring system for endemic and epidemic viral respiratory

predictive values for laboratory confirmed influenza.\n The literature has indicated the inclusion of other viruses may be the cause of these variable results.\n The objective of the study was to evaluate ILI national sentinel criteria and viral etiologies in adults diagnosed with acute respiratory infection (ARI) and/or ILI from 2001 to 2003 in Sao Paulo, Brazil.\n Clinical and laboratory evaluations were observed from 420 adults and collected on a daily basis from outpatient care units at University Hospital.\n The ILI definition included: fever plus at least one respiratory symptom (cough and/or sore throat) and one constitutional symptom (headache, malaise, myalgia, sweat or chills, or fatigue).\n DFA and RT?PCR for influenza, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, enterovirus, coronavirus, rhinovirus, and metapneumovirus were performed on nasal washes and 61.8% resulted positive.\n The respiratory viruses detected most often were influenza and rhinovirus.\n ILI was reported for 240/420 patients (57.1%), with influenza and rhinovirus etiologies accounting for 30.9% and 19.6%, respectively.\n Rhinovirus peak activity was concurrent with the influenza season.\n These findings highlight the implications of other viruses in ILI etiology and suggest that during the influenza season, this clinical overlap must be considered in the diagnosis

etiology of respiratory infections in children under 5 years old living in tropical rural areas of Senegal: The EVIRA project","abstract":"Acute respiratory infection is one of the leading causes of child morbidity, especially in developing countries.\n Viruses are recognized as the predominant causative agents of acute respiratory infections.\n In Senegal, few data concerning the causes of respiratory infections are available, and those known relate mainly to classical influenza infections.\n Clinical and virological surveillance of acute respiratory infections was carried out in a rural community in children less than 5 years old.\n A standardized questionnaire was used and a nasopharyngeal swab sample was collected from each patient.\n These samples were tested for the detection of 20 respiratory viruses by multiplex RT?PCR or by viral culture.\n A total of 82 acute respiratory episodes were included, and 48 (58.5%) were found to be positive, with a total of 55 viral detections; several samples were positive for two (n?=?5) or 3 (n?=?1) viruses.\n Ten different viruses were identified: influenza viruses A, B, and C (n?=?25), human respiratory syncytial virus type A (n?=?13), rhinoviruses (n?=?8), human coronaviruses type 229E and NL63 (n?=?6), parainfluenza viruses 3 and 4 (n?=?2), and bocavirus (n?=?1).\n These results provide evidence on the importance and the diversity of viruses as causative agents of acute respiratory infections in children living in a rural community in Senegal.\n The establishment of sentinel surveillance sites could help estimate the burden of acute respiratory infection in the pediatric population and should help prepare the health care systems to identify and respond to new viral respiratory emergencies.\n J.\n

in Antananarivo, Madagascar, July 2008 to June 2009","abstract":"Background\nIn Madagascar, despite an influenza surveillance established since 1978, little is known about the etiology and prevalence of viruses other than influenza causing influenza-like illnesses (ILIs).\n\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nFrom July 2008 to June 2009, we collected respiratory specimens from patients who presented ILIs symptoms in public and private clinics in Antananarivo (the capital city of Madagascar).\n\n ILIs were defined as body temperature ?38°C and cough and at least two of the following symptoms: sore throat, rhinorrhea, headache and muscular pain, for a maximum duration of 3 days.\n\n We screened these specimens using five multiplex real time Reverse Transcription and/or Polymerase Chain Reaction assays for detection of 14 respiratory viruses.\n\n We detected respiratory viruses in 235/313 (75.1%) samples.\n\n Overall influenza virus A (27.3%) was the most common virus followed by rhinovirus (24.8%), RSV (21.2%), adenovirus (6.1%), coronavirus OC43 (6.1%), influenza virus B (3.9%), parainfluenza virus-3 (2.9%), and parainfluenza virus-1 (2.3%).\n\n Co-infections occurred in 29.4% (69/235) of infected patients and rhinovirus was the most detected virus (27.5%).\n\n Children under 5 years were more likely to have one or more detectable virus associated with their ILI.\n\n In this age group, compared to those ?5 years, the risk of detecting more than one virus was higher (OR?=?1.9), as was the risk of detecting of RSV (OR?=?10.1) and adenovirus (OR?=?4.7).\n\n While rhinovirus and adenovirus infections occurred year round, RSV, influenza virus A and coronavirus OC43 had defined period of circulation.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn our study, we found that respiratory viruses play an important role in ILIs in the Malagasy community, particularly in children under 5 years old.\n\n These data provide a better understanding of the viral etiology of outpatients with ILI and describe for the first time importance of these viruses in different age group and their period of circulation.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3048401","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public

numerous pathogens, however; there is limited information on the etiology and epidemiology of ILI in China.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed a one-year surveillance study (2010) of viral etiology causing ILI and investigated the influence of climate on outbreaks of ILI attributed to viruses at the Outpatient Department of Zhuhai Municipal People’s Hospital in Zhuhai, China.\n\n\nResults\nOf the 337,272 outpatients who sought attention in the Outpatient Department of Zhuhai Municipal People’s Hospital in 2010, 3,747 (1.11%) presented with ILI.\n\n Of these patients presenting with ILI, 24.66% (924/3,747) had available samples and were enrolled in this study.\n\n At least one respiratory virus was identified in 411 patients (44.48%) and 42 (4.55%) were co-infected with two viruses.\n\n In patients co-infected with two viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was detected in 50% (21/42).\n\n Among common viral pathogens detected, significant differences in age distributions were observed in seasonal influenza virus A (sFulA, H3N2) and B (sFluB), pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza viruses (H1N1pdm09), RSV, and adenovirus (ADV).\n\n Infections with sFluA (H3N2), sFluB, RSV, and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) had characteristic seasonal patterns.\n\n The incidences of sFluA (H3N2), ADV, and RSV correlated with air temperature.\n\n Alternatively, the incidence of sFluB correlated with relative air humidity.\n\n\nConclusions\nThese results demonstrate that a wide range of respiratory viral pathogens are circulating in Zhuhai city.\n\n This information needs to be considered by clinicians when treating patients presenting with ILI.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3655035","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

between January, 1995, and June, 2009, and ten unpublished population-based studies.\n\n We estimated possible boundaries for RSV-associated ALRI mortality by combining case fatality ratios with incidence estimates from hospital-based reports from published and unpublished studies and identifying studies with population-based data for RSV seasonality and monthly ALRI mortality.\n\n\nFindings\nIn 2005, an estimated 33·8 (95% CI 19·3–46·2) million new episodes of RSV-associated ALRI occurred worldwide in children younger than 5 years (22% of ALRI episodes), with at least 3·4 (2·8–4·3) million episodes representing severe RSV-associated ALRI necessitating hospital admission.\n\n We estimated that 66?000–199?000 children younger than 5 years died from RSV-associated ALRI in 2005, with 99% of these deaths occurring in developing countries.\n\n Incidence and mortality can vary substantially from year to year in any one setting.\n\n\nInterpretation\nGlobally, RSV is the most common cause of childhood ALRI and a major cause of admission to hospital as a result of severe ALRI.\n\n Mortality data suggest that RSV is an important cause of death in childhood from ALRI, after pneumococcal pneumonia and Haemophilus influenzae type b.\n\n The development of novel prevention and treatment strategies should be accelerated as a priority.\n\n\nFunding\nWHO; Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2864404","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Lancet Publishing

Peru","abstract":"Background\nAcute respiratory illnesses and influenza-like illnesses (ILI) are a significant source of morbidity and mortality worldwide.\n\n Despite the public health importance, little is known about the etiology of these acute respiratory illnesses in many regions of South America.\n\n In 2006, the Peruvian Ministry of Health (MoH) and the US Naval Medical Research Center Detachment (NMRCD) initiated a collaboration to characterize the viral agents associated with ILI and to describe the clinical and epidemiological presentation of the affected population.\n\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nPatients with ILI (fever ?38°C and cough or sore throat) were evaluated in clinics and hospitals in 13 Peruvian cities representative of the four main regions of the country.\n\n Nasal and oropharyngeal swabs, as well as epidemiological and demographic data, were collected from each patient.\n\n During the two years of this study (June 2006 through May 2008), a total of 6,835 patients, with a median age of 13 years, were recruited from 31 clinics and hospitals; 6,308 were enrolled by regular passive surveillance and 527 were enrolled as part of outbreak investigations.\n\n At least one respiratory virus was isolated from the specimens of 2,688 (42.6%) patients, with etiologies varying by age and geographical region.\n\n Overall the most common viral agents isolated were influenza A virus (25.1%), influenza B virus (9.7%), parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, and 3, (HPIV-1,-2,-3; 3.2%), herpes simplex virus (HSV; 2.6%), and adenoviruses (1.8%).\n\n Genetic analyses of influenza virus isolates demonstrated that three lineages of influenza A H1N1, one lineage of influenza A H3N2, and two lineages of influenza B were circulating in Peru during the course of this study.\n\n\nConclusions\nTo our knowledge this is the most comprehensive study to date of the etiologic agents associated with ILI in Peru.\n\n These results demonstrate that a wide range of respiratory pathogens are circulating in Peru and this fact needs to be considered by clinicians when treating patients reporting with ILI.\n\n Furthermore, these data have implications for influenza vaccine design and implementation in South America.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2700970","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

Infections Identified in Upper Respiratory Tract Infected Children under Three Years of Age in Shanghai, China","abstract":"Background\nUpper respiratory tract infection (URTI) is a major reason for hospitalization in childhood.\n\n More than 80% of URTIs are viral.\n\n Etiological diagnosis of URTIs is important to make correct clinical decisions on treatment methods.\n\n However, data for viral spectrum of URTIs are very limited in Shanghai children.\n\n\nMethods\nNasopharyngeal swabs were collected from a group of 164 children aged below 3 years who were hospitalized due to acute respiratory infection from May 2009 to July 2010 in Shanghai.\n\n A VRDAL multiplex PCR for 10 common respiratory viruses was performed on collected specimens compared with the Seeplex® RV15 ACE Detection kit for 15 respiratory viruses.\n\n\nResults\nViruses were detected in 84 (51.2%) patients by VRDAL multiplex PCR, and 8 (4.9%) of cases were mixed infections.\n\n Using the Seeplex® RV15 ACE Detection kit, viruses were detected in 129 (78.7%) patients, 49 (29.9%) were co-infected cases.\n\n Identified viruses included 37 of human rhinovirus (22.6% of cases), 32 of influenza A virus (19.5%), 30 of parainfluenzavirus-2 (18.3%), 23 of parainfluenzavirus-3 (14.0%), 15 of human enterovirus (9.1%), 14 each of parainfluenzavirus-1, respiratory syncytial virus B and adenovirus (8.5%), 8 of coronavirus 229E/NL63 (4.9%), 6 of human bocavirus (3.7%), 5 each of influenza B virus and respiratory syncytial virus A (3.0%), 3 of parainfluenzavirus-4 (1.8%), 2 of coronavirus OC43/HKU1 (1.2%), and 1 human metapneumovirus (0.6%).\n\n\nConclusions\nA high frequency of respiratory infections (78.7%) and co-infections (29.9%) was detected in children with acute respiratory infection symptoms in Shanghai.\n\n The Seeplex® RV15 ACE detection method was found to be a more reliable high throughput tool than VRDAL method to simultaneously detect multiple respiratory

severe respiratory distress.\n The aim of this study was to investigate respiratory infections in children treated in a hospital intensive care unit (ICU).\n Assays were performed using the CLART®

specimens collected from 53 children under 2 years of age and admitted to an ICU were tested.\n At least one virus was detected in 78% (57/73) of the samples.\n The virological diagnosis was based on single infections in 65% (37/57) and on multiple infections in 35% (20/57) of cases.\n The array assay revealed respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in 73.6% (42/57) of the samples and rhinovirus in 24.6% (14/57), either on their own or in co?infections.\n All viruses identified in single and multiple infections were tested, taking into account clinical features, risk factors, and severity criteria.\n Children with no risk factors presented more multiple infections, up to 42% of cases, than children with at least one risk factor.\n RSV seemed to induce severe symptoms by itself as no difference in intubation needs was observed when RSV was detected on its own or in co?infection.\n The CLART® Pneumovir DNA array was useful for examining severe viral respiratory infections, when other viruses than those detected by conventional methods could be involved, particularly in an ICU.\n J.\n Med.\n Virol.\n 83:150–155, 2011. © 2010 Wiley?Liss,

Enhanced surveillance and early detection of respiratory viral pathogens can be useful in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of ARTIs, and for guiding the development of appropriate public health strategies.\n1. Background\nAcute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in children and adults worldwide. The mortality rate is higher in children under five years of age, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals. The most common causative agents of ARTIs are viruses. Influenza A virus (IFV-A), influenza B virus (IFV-B), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses (PIVs), adenovirus (AdV), and rhinovirus (RV) are the most frequently reported viruses associated with ARTIs in the general population. However, their distribution varies by season, geographic region, and age group.\nThe clinical presentations of different pathogens, either viral or bacterial, are similar and therefore the accurate etiologic diagnosis of ARTIs relies entirely on laboratory investigations. Early detection of related causative agents is crucial for providing an appropriate treatment regimen, decreasing the use of unnecessary antibiotics, limiting the spread of infection, and shortening the hospitalization duration. Different laboratory diagnostic methods are available for determining the causative pathogens related to ARTIs. The conventional methods, such as viral cell cultures and antigen detection tests (such as enzyme immunoassays and direct fluorescent antibody tests), are effective and often complementary, but they have some limitations. Although the cell culture technique is considered to be the gold standard for virus detection, the process is laborious and time-consuming, and it is almost impossible to obtain results during the acute phase of the disease. Antigen-detection tests can provide more rapid results, but are less sensitive and/or specific compared to cell culture techniques.\nMolecular diagnostic methods allow the identification of a wide range of viral and bacterial pathogens within hours, with excellent sensitivity and specificity. Multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays provide simultaneous amplification of several viruses or bacteria in a single reaction and make it easy to detect the common causative agents of ARTIs. In addition, these tests are able to detect emerging respiratory viruses, such as human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human coronavirus (HCoV) NL63, HCoV HKU1 and human bocavirus (HBoV), which are difficult to grow in cell cultures.\n2. Objectives\nThe aim of this cross-sectional study was to determine the prevalence and seasonal distribution of causative viral agents over a one-year period in children and adults who were living in Istanbul and had a pre-diagnosis of ARTI.\n3. Methods\nA total of 845 nasopharyngeal swab specimens were obtained from patients with a clinical pre-diagnosis of ARTI between September 1, 2014, and August 31, 2015. The specimens were transferred from healthcare institutions in Istanbul to Gelisim Medical laboratories, and analyzed directly or stored at -80 C until tested. The samples were analyzed for respiratory viruses and bacteria by using the RespiFinder Smart 22 assay (PathoFinder BV, the Netherlands). Each sample was simultaneously tested for the following 22 pathogens: IFV-A, IFV-A (H1N1)pdm09, IFV-B, PIV-1, PIV-2, PIV-3, PIV-4, RSV-A, RSV-B, HMPV, rhinovirus/enterovirus (RV/EV), HBoV, AdV, HCoV NL63, HCoV HKU1, HCoV 229E, HCoV OC43, Bordetella pertussis (BP), Chlamydophila pneumoniae (CP), Legionella pneumophila (LP), and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP). First, viral and bacterial nucleic acids (DNA or RNA) were extracted according to the kit protocol. Next, amplification, detection, and data analysis were performed with the Rotor-Gene 6000 real-time PCR system (Qiagen, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nThe statistical analysis was performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Chi-square or Fisher's exact tests were used for comparisons between groups in terms of categorical variables, wherever appropriate. A P value of &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n4. Results\n4.1. Overall Detection of Respiratory Pathogens\nA total of 845 nasopharyngeal swab specimens from 309 children and 536 adults with ARTI were analyzed. The median age was 29 years (range 0 - 91 years); 444 (52.5%) of the patients were male and 401 (47.5%) were female.\nIn 233 (27.6%) of the specimens, no pathogen was detected, while 612 (72.4%) of the specimens were positive for one or more pathogens (Table 1). The positive detection rate in children (232/309, 75.1%) was found to be higher than in adults (380/536, 70.9%), but the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.190).

Co-Infected Cases\nCo-infection was seen in 215 specimens, with detection rates of 25.4% (215/845) of all specimens and 35.1% (215/612) of positive specimens. Co-infection was more common in male patients (124/444, 27.9%) than in female patients (91/401, 22.7%), but the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.081). The co-infection rate in children (84/309, 27.2%) was found to be higher than in adults (131/536, 24.4%), but the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.378). The distribution of co-infections is shown in Table 3. The most frequently detected co-infection combinations were IFV-A/HBoV (n = 26) and IFV-A/IFV-B (n = 20), respectively.

Among the bacteria, 17 MP, nine BP, seven LP, and five CP pathogens were detected as single pathogens, while 32 MP, six BP, four LP, and one CP pathogen were detected in co-infections.\n4.4. Seasonal Distribution\nThe monthly and seasonal distribution of respiratory viruses detected in 2014 - 2015 are shown in Table 4 and Figure 1, respectively. IFV-A, RV/EV, RSV A/B, AdV, and HCoV were seen throughout the year, with different peak months. The total detection rate of respiratory viruses was found to be highest in March (197/821, 24%) and April (105/821, 12.8%), and lowest in September (31/821, 3.8%). Seasonally, the total detection rates for respiratory viruses in spring, summer, autumn, and winter were 43.7%, 20.8%, 13.7%, and 21.8%, respectively. Among the bacterial pathogens, MP was more frequently detected in summer (22/49, 44.9%) and winter (11/49, 22.4%), LP was more frequent in winter (11/11, 100%), and BP was more frequent in winter (6/15, 40%). The co-infections were more frequently detected in spring (98/215, 45.6%) and winter (47/215, 21.9%) than in summer (40/215, 18.6%) and autumn (30/215, 14%).\n Monthly Distribution of Respiratory Viruses (2014 - 2015)\nMonth	IFV-A	IFV-B	RV/EV	HBoV	RSV A/B	AdV	HCoVs	PIVs	HMPV	Total (n)	 	September	7	0	8	8	1	2	1	2	2	31	 	October	11	0	10	5	2	3	2	0	3	36	 	November	10	0	10	9	5	3	2	2	4	45	 	December	11	0	15	11	6	3	4	3	4	57	 	January	8	20	14	4	15	4	4	3	6	78	 	February	10	24	3	0	2	1	3	0	1	44	 	March	86	83	2	0	7	3	8	0	8	197	 	April	33	19	10	8	5	10	13	3	4	105	 	May	9	6	12	9	9	9	1	2	0	57	 	June	9	3	3	9	4	8	3	7	3	49	 	July	15	2	12	19	6	8	6	9	0	77	 	August	10	0	8	9	2	2	4	9	1	45	 	Total (n)	219	157	107	91	64	56	51	40	36	821	 	\nSeasonal Distribution of Respiratory Viruses\n5. Discussion\nRapid and accurate identification of the viral agents of ARTIs is critically important in order to initiate appropriate antiviral therapy and to prevent the overuse of antibiotics, nosocomial transmission, and lengthy hospital stays. Molecular techniques with higher sensitivity and rapidity play a critical role in the early identification of respiratory viral pathogens, particularly during epidemics. However, the virus-detection rate varies depending on the specimen type, the method used, the working group, and when the study was performed. In our study, nasopharyngeal swabs were tested for 18 respiratory viruses and four bacteria by using a multiplex real-time PCR assay, and at least one agent was identified in 72.4% of the samples. This high positive detection rate is similar to the rates reported in other studies, in which molecular methods were performed. The results indicated that individuals in all age groups were susceptible to multiple respiratory viruses that simultaneously circulate in the community. Moreover, despite no significant differences, the detection rate of pathogens in children (75.1%) was slightly higher than in adults (70.9%) (Table 1). Previous reports suggested that positive detection rates (in the range of 30.9% - 96.1%) for respiratory viruses in pediatric groups were higher than in adult groups. Viral ARTIs have been suggested to occur more frequently in males. Our data also showed a slight male preponderance (53.4%) among the positive cases, but the overall positive detection rate was not significantly different between male and female patients.\nAmong the respiratory viruses, IFVs are some of the most important genera due to their epidemic and pandemic potential in terms of public health. IFVs can have different clinical manifestations, from mild upper respiratory tract infections to severe pneumonia resulting in death. In this study, IFV-A was the most commonly detected agent, both in children over 5 years of age and in adults (Table 2). In addition, the detection rates of IFV-A and IFV-B in adults were found to be significantly higher than in children. In contrast to our results, Javadi et al. detected the most common agents as RV in the 0 - 4-year-old age group and IFV-B in the 5 - 50-year-old age group in Iran. In another study conducted in the United States, HBoV (in the 0 - 4-year-old age group) and RV (in the 5 - 50-year-old age group) were found to be the most prevalent agents. However, Ren et al. and Liao et al. found the most common agent in adults in China to be IFV-A, which was similar to our findings. These results support that the prevalence of respiratory viruses changes based on geographic region and age group.\nRV and EV are both members of the enterovirus genus, and the kit used in this study was not designed for the identification of these two viruses at species level. RV, once thought to cause only the common cold in children and adults, is now considered to be a major cause of lower ARTIs and asthmatic exacerbations. In our study, RV/EV were the second most frequent agents following IFVs, comprising 13% of the detected viruses (Table 2). Similarly, Shih et al. found the most common agent to be IFVs and the second most common to be RV/EV.\nRespiratory syncytial virus is known as the most common cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infants and young children worldwide, and is divided into two subgroups, A and B, depending on the antigenic and genetic variety. In this study, the detection rate of RSV A/B in children was significantly higher than in adults, and RSV A/B was the most commonly detected pathogen in the 0 - 4-year-old age group. Our results confirmed the previous observations regarding the importance of RSV A/B in children under 5 years of age.\nIn the current study, two or more pathogens were detected in 25.4% of all samples, with a higher rate in children and in male patients. In a systematic review, Goka et al. reported that co-infection rates ranged from 5% to 62%, and RSV has been found to be the most predominant co-infecting virus in many studies. However, Zhang et al. and Ren et al. detected the most prevalent viral agents in co-infections to be IFVs and RV. In another study conducted in our country, HBoV and HMPV were found to be the most common co-infecting viruses. In this study, AdV, HBoV, HMPV, RV/EV, and HCoVs were more frequently found in co-infections, and the most commonly detected co-infections were IFV-A/HBoV and IFV-A/IFV-B (Table 3).\nIt was reported that the high co-infection prevalence of AdV and HBoV may have resulted from asymptomatic persistence, prolonged nasopharyngeal shedding, or a tendency to infect or colonize in the presence of other viruses. Similarly, Byington et al. found that the detection of HBoV was not associated with clinical symptoms in 54% of cases. On the other hand, although nasopharyngeal samples were suggested to reveal reliable results for detecting viral agents, the findings described above may indicate that pathogen detection in the nasopharynx may not accurately represent the situation in the lower respiratory tract. Moreover, the possibility of contamination during sample collection or analysis could not be excluded, and this should be kept in mind in clinical evaluations. Assessment of viral load may be a better choice in the interpretation of positive co-infection results, but it has been reported that more studies would be required to clarify the potential value of quantitative test results. In addition, in most studies, it has been suggested that the presence of more than one pathogen in a respiratory sample did not affect the clinical presentation of ARTIs, but the relationship between co-infection and severity of disease remains debatable.\nIt is known that viral ARTIs have a seasonal character, particularly in regions with temperate climates, and the peak periods may change from year to year. In many studies, respiratory viruses have been reported to be active during the cold seasons (generally from November to March) in the Northern Hemisphere. In our study, interestingly, IFV-B was not detected in the autumn months or in December; it began to appear in January (Table 4, Figure 1). In contrast, IFV-A was seen throughout the year, with peak activity in March and April. RV/EV was most frequently seen in the autumn and winter months, RSV A/B and HMPV in the winter and spring months, HCoVs in the spring months, AdV in the spring and summer months, and HBoV and PIVs in the summer months. The differences in the peak periods, compared to previous reports, could be explained by the smaller number of cases in our study (particularly for HCoVs, PIVs, and HMPV), regional differences, or annual variability, which has been demonstrated in other studies.\nOur study had some limitations that should be mentioned. First, we were unable to obtain accurate inpatient or outpatient data of the cases and thus we could not present the distribution of respiratory viruses according to inpatient and outpatient groups. However, most of our contracted healthcare institutions consisted of local outpatient polyclinics in Istanbul, and a high proportion of the samples may have been collected from outpatients and a minority from inpatients. Second, although multiplex real-time PCR assays are reported to have excellent sensitivity and specificity, there is a possibility of false-positive or false-negative results. As mentioned above, it may be difficult to diagnose whether a positive nasopharyngeal swab shows the etiology or evidence of nasopharyngeal colonization. Lastly, one year may be considered too short a time for an epidemiologic study, but we think that our preliminary data could provide useful findings for further investigations.\nIn conclusion, IFV-A was found to be the most prevalent respiratory pathogen in all age groups except for children under 5 years of age, in whom RSV A/B was the most common agent. In our region, respiratory viruses were generally active in the early spring and winter, and the peak months for these agents were different from each other over a one-year period. Early detection and monitoring of respiratory pathogens is essential in order to avoid the unnecessary use of antibiotics, to control the spread of infection, and to contribute to public health surveillance efforts, and the multiplex real-time PCR assay could be a suitable and effective method in this regard.\nAuthors' Contribution:Study concept and design, acquisition of data, and critical

antigen tests and conventional cell culture for respiratory virus detection","abstract":"Background and objectives\nConventional cell culture (CC) has limited clinical utility as a result of the extended incubation period often required for virus isolation.\n\n Alternative methodologies have been introduced in an effort to improve turnaround times.\n\n One such system, the R-mix™ shell vial is discussed herein.\n\n The study objectives were: (a) to establish R-mix™ testing parameters as compared to direct antigen testing (DAT) and CC, and (b) to assess technical aspects and cost of R-mix™ in a high volume clinical virology laboratory.\n\n\nStudy design\nA prospective analysis of respiratory samples submitted to the clinical virology laboratory between November 2004 and April 2005 was performed.\n\n All specimens were inoculated onto R-mix™ shell vials (SV) and CC tubes; and a subset also underwent DAT for influenza A and B and/or RSV.\n\n A retrospective estimated cost analysis was made.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 563 samples were included in the study, which collectively revealed a total of 207 viruses.\n\n Sensitivity of R-mix™ for seven major respiratory viruses ranged from 45% to 83% compared to CC and DAT, while mean time to detection (TTD) varied from 1.1 to 1.4 days.\n\n In addition to these viruses, 23 picornaviruses, 11 CMV isolates and 5 HSV isolates were detected by CC alone.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe R-mix™ system has similar sensitivity as CC for the detection of parainfluenza 1–3 and influenza A/B while dramatically reducing the TTD.\n\n Furthermore, it is significantly more sensitive and produces more timely results for RSV than CC; yet, neither method offers a diagnostic benefit over rapid DAT for RSV detection.\n\n The sensitivity of R-mix™ for adenovirus appears to be significantly lower than that of CC.\n\n Lastly, methodologies other than R-mix™ must remain in place under circumstances where identification of other potential viral respiratory pathogens, including herpesviruses and picornaviruses, is desired.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7108409","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier B.V.","authors":[{"firstname":"P.

in the identification of a microbe in 67.0% of specimens.\n After our study, the majority of microbes detected were RNA viruses (89.9%).\n Overall, human rhinoviruses (HRVs) were the most frequently identified target (n?=?140) followed by human adenoviruses (HAdVs; n?=?25), human metapneumovirus (HMPV; n?=?18), human bocavirus (HBoV; n?=?15), human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV; n?=?12), human coronaviruses (HCoVs; n?=?11), and human herpesvirus?6 (n?=?11).\n HRVs were the sole microbe detected in 37.8% (n?=?31) of patients with suspected lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI).\n Genotyping of the HRV VP4/VP2 region resulted in a proposed subdivision of HRV type A into sublineages A1 and A2. Most of the genotyped HAdV strains were found to be type C.\n This study describes the high microbial burden imposed by HRVs, HMPV, HRSV, HCoVs, and the newly identified virus, HBoV on a predominantly paediatric hospital population with suspected acute respiratory tract infections and proposes a new formulation of viral targets for future diagnostic research studies.\n J.\n Med.\n Virol.\n

young children and immunosuppressed patients.\n Objectives: To rapidly and accurately quantify and subtype RSV in respiratory samples, we developed and evaluated two real-time RT-PCR assays.\n Study design: A quantitative assay was designed using primers for a consensus region of the matrix protein gene and a subtype-specific assay for RSV-A and RSV-B detection was designed using primers for the polymerase gene.\n Quantitative RSV RT-PCR results of pediatric nasal wash samples submitted to the University of Washington Virology Laboratory from December 2002, through May 2003, were compared to those of an indirect fluorescent antibody RSV antigen detection assay (FA).\n Results: Specificity of the RT-PCR assay was high, with no amplification of eleven common respiratory viruses and eight herpes viruses.\n Among 751 samples, RSV was detected in 267 (35.6%) by FA and in 286 (38.1%) by RT-PCR.\n Median RSV copy number in nasal wash samples that were positive by both FA and RT-PCR was 2.5×107 copies/mL versus a median of 3.0×104 copies/mL for samples positive by RT-PCR only (P&lt;0.001).\n The detection and quantity of RSV in respiratory specimens was associated with younger age, but not with gender or hospitalization.\n Among positive samples from this Seattle cohort, 52% were subtype A and 48% were subtype B.\n Both subtypes were detected with similar viral loads among all patient groups (stratified by age, gender, and hospitalization), and throughout the specimen collection period.\n Conclusions: These real-time RT-PCR assays provide a rapid, specific, and highly sensitive alternative for detecting, quantifying, and subtyping RSV in clinical specimens.\n","id":"PMC7128826","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

the precise role that HCoVs play in RTIs is greatly underestimated.\n We describe a rapid, sensitive, and highly specific quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction

detection and information for epidemiological studies.\n For viruses such as influenza A, influenza B and respiratory syncytial virus, NATs offer enhanced sensitivity above antigen assays but still identify the seasonal peaks important for predicting disease and managing time-sensitive prophylaxis.\n For other viruses, such as rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, human bocavirus and parainfluenza virus type 4, culture and antigen-based procedures are not available and/or lack sensitivity.\n Thus such targets would be missed if NATs were not included in testing for surveillance and outbreak investigation.\n As more respiratory viruses are identified there is a need to expand surveillance and further evaluate new technologies and automation beyond currently-available diagnostics to address detection of a broad range of potential pathogens.\n","id":"PMC7128565","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier B.V.","authors":[{"firstname":"Julie

causative for respiratory tract infections, but symptoms are mostly similar.\n\n Therefore, the identification of the causative viruses and bacteria is only feasible using multiplex PCR or several monoplex PCR tests in parallel.\n\n\nMethods\nThe analytical sensitivity of three multiplex PCR assays, RespiFinder-19, RespiFinder-SMART-22 and xTAG-Respiratory-Virus-Panel-Fast-Assay (RVP), were compared to monoplex real-time PCR with quantified standardized control material.\n\n All assays include the most common respiratory pathogens.\n\n\nResults\nTo compare the analytical sensitivity of the multiplex assays, samples were inoculated with 13 different quantified viruses in the range of 101 to 105 copies/ml.\n\n Concordant results were received for rhinovirus, whereas the RVP detected influenzavirus, RSV and hMPV more frequently in low concentrations.\n\n The RespiFinder-19 and the RespiFinder-SMART-22 showed a higher analytical sensitivity for adenoviruses and coronaviruses, whereas the RVP was incapable to detect adenovirus and coronavirus in concentrations of 104 copies/ml.\n\n The RespiFinder-19 and RespiFinder-SMART-22A did not detect influenzaviruses (104 copies/ml) and RSV (103 copies/ml).\n\n The detection of all 13 viruses in one sample was only achieved using monoplex PCR.\n\n To analyze possible competitive amplification reactions between the different

been previously compared individually to those of conventional techniques.\n This study compared the practicability and the diagnostic performances of six CE-marked kits available in 2011 on the French market, including 2 detecting viruses and atypical bacteria (from Pathofinder and Seegene companies) and 4 detecting only viruses (from Abbott, Genomica, Qiagen and Seegene companies).\n The respective sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and agreement of each multiplex technique were calculated by comparison to commercial duplex PCR tests (Argene/bioMérieux) used as gold standard.\n Eighty-eight respiratory specimens with no pathogen (n?=?11), single infections (n?=?33) or co-infections (n?=?44) were selected to cover 9 viruses or groups of viruses and 3 atypical bacteria.\n All samples were extracted using the NUCLISENS® easyMAG™ instrument (bioMérieux).\n The overall sensitivity ranged from 56.25% to 91.67% for viruses and was below 50% with both tests for bacteria.\n The overall specificity was excellent (&gt;94% for all pathogens).\n For each tested kit, the overall agreement with the reference test was strong for viruses (kappa test &gt;0.60) and moderate for bacteria.\n After the extraction step, the hands-on time varied from 50 min to 2h30 and the complete results were available in 2h30 to 9 h.\n The spectrum of tested agents and the technology used to reveal the PCR products as well as the laboratory organization are determinant for the selection of a kit.\n","id":"PMC3751960","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nThe potential role of respiratory viruses in the natural history of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults has not been well described since the advent of nucleic amplification tests (NATs).\n\n\nMethods\nFrom 2004 to 2006, adults with CAP who were admitted to five hospitals were prospectively enrolled in the study, and clinical data, cultures, serology, and nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained.\n\n NATs from swabs were tested for influenza, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus 1–4, coronaviruses (OC43, 229E, and NL63), and adenovirus.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 193 patients were included; the median age was 71 years, 51% of patients were male, and 47% of patients had severe CAP.\n\n Overall, 75 patients (39%) had a pathogen identified.\n\n Of these pathogens, 29 were viruses (15%), 38 were bacteria (20%), 8 were mixed (4%), and the rest were “unknown.\n\n” Influenza (n = 7), hMPV (n = 7), and RSV (n = 5) accounted for most viral infections; other infections included rhinovirus (n = 4), parainfluenza (n = 3), coronavirus (n = 4), and adenovirus (n = 2).\n\n Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common bacterial infection (37%).\n\n Compared with bacterial infection, patients with viral infection were older (76 vs 64 years, respectively; p = 0.01), were more likely to have cardiac disease (66% vs 32%, respectively; p = 0.006), and were more frail (eg, 48% with limited ambulation vs 21% of bacterial infections; p = 0.02).\n\n There were few clinically meaningful differences in presentation and no differences in outcomes according to the presence or absence of viral infection.\n\n\nConclusions\nViral infections are common in adults with pneumonia.\n\n Easily transmissible viruses such as influenza, hMPV, and RSV were the most common, raising concerns about infection control.\n\n Routine testing for respiratory viruses may be warranted for adults who have been hospitalized with pneumonia.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7094572","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"The American College of Chest Physicians.

2005–2007","abstract":"To determine the aetiological role and epidemiological profile of common respiratory viruses in adults with acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs), a 2?year study was conducted in Beijing, China, from May 2005 to July 2007. Nose and throat swab samples from 5808 ARTI patients were analysed by PCR methods for common respiratory viruses, including influenza viruses (IFVs) A, B, and C, parainfluenza viruses (PIVs) 1–4, enteroviruses (EVs), human rhinoviruses (HRVs), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human coronaviruses (HCoVs) OC43, 229E, NL63, and HKU1, and adenoviruses (ADVs).\n Viral pathogens were detected in 34.6% of patient samples, and 1.6% of the patients tested positive for more than one virus.\n IFVs (19.3%) were the dominant agents detected, followed by HRVs (6.5%), PIVs (4.3%), EVs (3.2%), and HCoVs (1.1%).\n ADVs, RSV and HMPV were also detected (&lt;1%).\n The viral detection rates differed significantly between infections of the lower and upper respiratory tracts in the sample population: PIVs, the second most commonly detected viral agents in lower acute respiratory tract infections (LRTIs), were more prevalent than in upper acute respiratory tract infections, indicating that the pathogenic role of PIVs in LRTIs should be investigated.\n Currently, this study is the largest?scale investigation of respiratory virus infections in China with multiple agent detection, providing baseline data for further studies of respiratory virus infections in adults with

similar.\n\n Therefore, the identification of the causative viruses and bacteria is only feasible using multiplex PCR or several monoplex PCR tests in parallel.\n\n\nMethods\nThe analytical sensitivity of three multiplex PCR assays, RespiFinder-19, RespiFinder-SMART-22 and xTAG-Respiratory-Virus-Panel-Fast-Assay (RVP), were compared to monoplex real-time PCR with quantified standardized control material.\n\n All assays include the most common respiratory pathogens.\n\n\nResults\nTo compare the analytical sensitivity of the multiplex assays, samples were inoculated with 13 different quantified viruses in the range of 101 to 105 copies/ml.\n\n Concordant results were received for rhinovirus, whereas the RVP detected influenzavirus, RSV and hMPV more frequently in low concentrations.\n\n The RespiFinder-19 and the RespiFinder-SMART-22 showed a higher analytical sensitivity for adenoviruses and coronaviruses, whereas the RVP was incapable to detect adenovirus and coronavirus in concentrations of 104 copies/ml.\n\n The RespiFinder-19 and RespiFinder-SMART-22A did not detect influenzaviruses (104 copies/ml) and RSV (103 copies/ml).\n\n The detection of all 13 viruses in one sample was only achieved using monoplex PCR.\n\n To analyze possible competitive amplification reactions between the different viruses, samples were further inoculated with only 4 different viruses in one sample.\n\n Compared to the detection of 13 viruses in parallel, only a few differences were found.\n\n\nConclusions\nMultiplex PCR tests have a broad spectrum of pathogens to test at a time.\n\n Analysis of multiple inoculated samples revealed a different focus of the detected virus types by the three assays.\n\n Analysis of clinical samples showed a high concordance of detected viruses by the RespiFinder-19 compared to monoplex tests.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3519643","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

ventilated patients: a prospective cohort study","abstract":"Introduction\nRespiratory viruses are a major cause of respiratory tract infections.\n\n The prevalence of a virus-positive respiratory sample and its significance in patients requiring mechanical ventilation remain unknown.\n\n\nMethods\nWe conducted a cohort study in all consecutive adults ventilated for more than 48 hours admitted to a 22-bed medical intensive care unit during a 12-month period.\n\n Respiratory samples at the time of intubation were assessed by culture, by indirect immunofluorescence assay or by molecular methods in systematic tracheobronchial aspirates.\n\n Patients with a virus-negative respiratory sample at the time of intubation were considered unexposed and served as the control group.\n\n\nResults\nForty-five viruses were isolated in 41/187 (22%) patients.\n\n Rhinovirus was the most commonly isolated virus (42%), followed byherpes simplex virus type 1 (22%) and virus influenza A (16%).\n\n In multivariate analysis controlling for the Acute Pathophysiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, patients with respiratory disorder at admission (adjusted odds ratio, 2.1; 95% confidence interval, 0.8–5.1; P = 0.12), with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/asthma patients (adjusted odds ratio, 3.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.3–6.7; P = 0.01) and with admission between 21 November and 21 March (adjusted odds ratio, 2.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.3–5.9; P = 0.008) were independently associated with a virus-positive sample.\n\n Among the 122 patients admitted with respiratory disorder, a tracheobronchial aspirate positive for respiratory viruses at the time of intubation (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.273; 95% confidence interval, 0.096–0.777; P &lt; 0.006) was independently associated with better survival, controlling for the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II and admission for cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest.\n\n Among the remaining 65 patients, a virus-positive sample on intubation did not predict survival.\n\n\nConclusion\nWe confirmed the pathogenic role of respiratory viruses in the intensive care unit, particularly rhinovirus.\n\n We suggest, however, that the prognostic value of virus-associated respiratory disorder is better than that of other causes of respiratory disorder.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1751045","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

Acute Respiratory Infection in Children Under Five Years","abstract":"Background\nAcute respiratory infection (ARI) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children worldwide.\n\n This study aimed to determine the viral and atypical bacterial causes of different severities and clinical manifestations of ARI in preschool children from low-income families in North-East Brazil.\n\n\nMethods\nClinical/demographic data and nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) were prospectively collected from children &lt;5 years presenting with ARI over one year to a paediatric A&amp;E department.\n\n Disease severity was grouped according to presence of lower respiratory tract signs, need for hospital admission and need for oxygen.\n\n Clinical manifestation of ARI was based on discharge diagnosis from hospital with four conditions predominating: bronchiolitis, pneumonia, episodic viral wheeze/asthma and upper respiratory tract infection.\n\n Multiplex PCR was used to detect 17 common respiratory viral and atypical bacterial pathogens in NPA.\n\n\nFindings\n407 children with a median age of eight months were recruited.\n\n Pathogens were detected in 85·5% samples with co-infection being particularly common (39·5%).\n\n Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV; 37%), Adenoviruses (AdV; 25%), Rhinoviruses (hRV; 19%), Bocavirus (hBoV; 19%), human Meta-pneumovirus (hMPV; 10%) and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (Mpp; 10%) were most prevalent.\n\n Detection and co-infection rates were similar in all severities and clinical manifestations of ARI apart from RSV, which was associated with more severe disease and specifically more severe cases of bronchiolitis, and Mpp, which was associated with more severe cases of pneumonia.\n\n Mpp was detected in 17% of children admitted to hospital with pneumonia.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThis study underlines the importance of viral and atypical bacterial pathogens in ARI in pre-school children and highlights the complex epidemiology of these pathogens in this age group.\n\n Generally, viruses and atypical bacteria were detected in all severities and clinical manifestations of ARI but RSV and Mpp were associated with more severe cases of bronchiolitis and pneumonia respectively.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3078930","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Patrícia G.

2004–2008","abstract":"Background\nThe dominant viral etiologies responsible for acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are poorly understood, particularly among hospitalized children in resource-limited tropical countries where morbidity and mortality caused by ARIs are highest.\n\n Improved etiological insight is needed to improve clinical management and prevention.\n\n\nObjectives\nWe conducted a three-year prospective descriptive study of severe respiratory illness among children from 2 months to 13 years of age within the largest referral hospital for infectious diseases in southern Vietnam.\n\n\nMethods\nMolecular detection for 15 viral species and subtypes was performed on three types of respiratory specimens (nose, throat swabs and nasopharyngeal aspirates) using a multiplex RT-PCR kit (Seeplex™ RV detection, Seegene) and additional monoplex real-time RT-PCRs.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 309 children were enrolled from November 2004 to January 2008. Viruses were identified in 72% (222/309) of cases, including respiratory syncytial virus (24%), influenza virus A and B (17%), human bocavirus (16%), enterovirus (9%), human coronavirus (8%), human metapneumovirus (7%), parainfluenza virus 1–3 (6%), adenovirus (5%), and human rhinovirus A (4%).\n\n Co-infections with multiple viruses were detected in 20% (62/309) of patients.\n\n When combined, diagnostic yields in nose and throat swabs were similar to nasopharyngeal aspirates.\n\n\nConclusion\nSimilar to other parts in the world, RSV and influenza were the predominant viral pathogens detected in Vietnamese hospitalized children.\n\n Combined nasal and throat swabs are the specimens of choice for sensitive molecular detection of a broad panel of viral agents.\n\n Further research is required to better understand the clinical significance of single versus multiple viral coinfections and to address the role of bacterial (co-)infections involved in severe respiratory illness.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3063798","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Anh Ha Lien","surname":"Do","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"H.

review","abstract":"Introduction\nThere are suggestions that virus co-infections may influence the clinical outcome of respiratory virus illness.\n\n We performed a systematic review of the literature to summarise the evidence.\n\n\nMethods\nMEDLINE, EMBASE, Ovid and WEB of Science databases, major organisation websites and reference lists of published studies were searched.\n\n The quality of studies was assessed using the STROBE tool (von Elm et al.\n\n, 1) Individual study data was analyzed using odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals as a measure of association between exposure (co-infection), patient outcome and results summarised using forest plots and tables\nResults\nNineteen (19) studies from all over the world were identified and included in the review.\n\n Most of the studies 73.7% (14/19) recruited children ?6 years old.\n\n Evidence on the role of co-infection in increasing disease severity was inconclusive.\n\n In five out of eight studies, co-infection significantly increased risk of admission to general ward (OR: 2.4, 95% CI: 1.3 - 4.4, p = 0.005; OR: 2.4, 95% CI: 1.1 - 7.7, P = 0.04; OR: 3.1, 95% CI: 2.0 - 5.1, p = &lt;0.001; OR: 2.4, 95% CI: 1.7-3.4, p = &lt;0.0001 and OR: 2.3, 95% CI: 1.1 - 5.1, p = 0.34), one found it did not (OR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.4 - 0.9, p = 0.02) and the other 2 had insignificant results.\n\n Similarly on risk of admission to ICU, some studies found that co-infection significantly increased risk of admission to ICU (OR: 2.9, 95% CI: 1.4 - 5.9, p = 0.004 and OR: 3.0, 95% CI: 1.7 - 5.6, p = &lt;0.0001), whereas others did not (OR: 0.18, 95% CI: 0.05 - 0.75, p = 0.02 and OR: 0.3, 95% CI: 0.2 - 0.6, p = &lt;0.0001).\n\n There was no evidence for or against respiratory virus co-infections and risk of bronchiolitis or pneumonia.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe influence of co-infections on severe viral respiratory disease is still unclear.\n\n The observed conflict in outcomes could be because they were conducted in different seasons and covered different years and periods.\n\n It could also be due to bias towards the null, especially in studies where only crude analysis was conducted.\n\n Future studies should employ stratified analysis.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7106320","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Edward

In otherwise healthy children, HCoVs typically cause mild upper respiratory tract infections, whereas in premature infants and children with chronic underlying diseases they may cause severe lower respiratory tract infections such as pneumonia and bronchiolitis. However, the role of HCoVs in severe disease is unclear because they are frequently co-detected with other respiratory viruses, most often with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Among four species of HCoVs, NL63 was found to be more frequently associated with croup than the other three species, whereas NL63 and HKU1 were associated with bronchiolitis and wheezing. Previous studies also suggested an association between HCoVs and involvement of the gastrointestinal and central nervous system. Almost half of patients with HCoVs respiratory infections report abdominal pain, emesis, and diarrhea, and HCoVs were detected in some patients with symptoms/signs limited to the gastrointestinal tract. Infections with 229E and OC43 have been implicated in the development of various chronic neurologic disorders, including multiple sclerosis; OC43 was demonstrated in the cerebrospinal fluid of a child presumed to have acute disseminated encephalomyelitis; and HKU1 has been associated with febrile seizures.\nThe aim of the study was to determine and compare the frequency of HCoVs in children with acute bronchiolitis (AB), acute gastroenteritis (AGE), and/or febrile seizures (FS), and to assess their etiological role in each individual syndrome.\nMaterials and Methods\nStudy population\nThe study presented here was a part of a prospective study on viral respiratory and gastrointestinal infections in children under 6 years of age. The study protocol was approved by the National Medical Ethics Committee of the Republic of Slovenia (No. 87/08/09) and was registered at the ClinicalTrials.gov registry (reg. NCT00987519). Written informed consent was obtained from the parents of all participating patients and control subjects. The principles of the Helsinki Declaration, the Oviedo Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine, and the Slovene Code of Medical Deontology were strictly followed in this study.\nChildren under 6 years of age, admitted to the Department of Infectious Diseases, University Medical Centre Ljubljana, from 10th October 2009 to 24th September 2011 (for participant) and from 23rd October 2009 to 7th October 2011 (for follow-up) with a diagnosis of AB (defined as the presence of nasal discharge, cough, wheezing, and/or crackles on lung auscultation), AGE (defined as passage of at least three or more loose or liquid stools in 24 hours requiring parenteral rehydration), and/or FS (defined as a cerebral paroxysm accompanied by fever without signs of central nervous system infection) were eligible for the study. Children with more than one clinical manifestation (i.e., AB and AGE) were classified under the diagnosis that had been the main reason for hospital admission. Nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs and blood samples were obtained upon admission and at a follow-up visit 14 days after initial sampling. In children with AGE a stool sample was also acquired upon admission to hospital. In an individual patient only one sample from the particular source was taken at each of the two time points. Findings in patients with AGE have been reported previously.\nThe healthy control group comprised children under 6 years old admitted to the Department of Pediatric Surgery and Intensive Care for elective surgical procedures (mainly for inguinal hernia, testicular retention, and hydrocele testis) during the same time period as the study subjects. In addition to the general rules requiring that only children without infections within the last four weeks prior to surgery be admitted for elective surgical procedures (and that the procedure is postponed in children with symptoms/signs of infection found at examination prior to surgery), this study also obtained additional specific information on the presence of signs and symptoms compatible with gastrointestinal and/or respiratory infection within the last 14 days. The NP swab and stool specimen were obtained from the control group participants upon admission; in order to minimize discomfort, nasopharyngeal sampling was performed after the children underwent general anesthesia.\nIn all participants an NP swab acquired at the initial examination was mandatory for the inclusion in the study; in patients with AGE a stool sample was also needed.\nSample preparation and nucleic acid extraction\nNP swabs were collected using flocked-tip swabs and transported to the laboratory of the Institute of Microbiology and Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Ljubljana in a Copan universal transport medium (UTM-RT) system (Copan Italia, Brescia, Italy).\nStool samples were diluted in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to a 10% stool suspension. Aliquots of 180 muL of MagNA Pure Bacteria Lyses Buffer (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) and 20 muL of proteinase K (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) were added to 190 muL of stool suspension.\nBefore the extraction procedure, 5 muL of Equine herpesvirus 1 and 5 muL of Equine arteritis virus isolates were added to all samples for external DNA and RNA control. Specific target sequences of these viruses were subsequently amplified in separate real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCRs) as an internal control to ensure that negative results were not caused by poor nucleic acid extraction or inhibition of the RT-PCR assay.\nThe initial volume used for extracting total nucleic acids was 190 muL of vigorously vortexed NP swab medium, 400 muL of stool suspension, and 190 muL of whole blood samples. Nucleic acids were extracted using total nucleic acid isolation kits on a MagNa Pure Compact instrument (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany), according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nDetection methods\nCoronaviruses including HKU1, NL63, 229E, and OC43 were tested in NP swabs, stool samples, and whole blood samples (blood was examined for the presence of HCoVs only in children with positive NP swabs and/or stool results) by molecular methods using primers and probes as described by Kuypers et al.. For amplification of 85-100 bp fragments of the coronaviruses' polymerase 1b gene, a one-step real-time RT-PCR assay was used in a StepOne Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA). Briefly, 5 muL of total nucleic acid was added to 15 muL of reaction mixture including 2 x Reaction Mix, SuperScript  III RT/Platinum  Taq Mix (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) with an additional 6 mM MgSO4. The cycling conditions were universal for all respiratory viruses tested: 20 min at 50 C, 2 min at 95 C, and 45 cycles of 15 s at 95 C and 45 s at 60 C.\nAll NP swabs and stool samples in which HCoVs were established were also tested for the presence of several other viruses. In NP swabs respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza viruses A and B (Inf A-B), parainfluenza viruses 1-3 (PIV 1-3), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), human bocavirus (HBoVs), adenovirus (AdV) and human rhinovirus (hRV) were searched for by real-time RT-PCR. Stool samples from patients with AGE were tested for the presence of noroviruses of genogroups I and II, human astroviruses, HBoV and AdV using molecular methods as described previously, whereas group A rotavirus and adenovirus type 40/41 were detected by antigen-ELISA Premier Rotaclone and Premier Adenoclone (Meridian Bioscience, Cincinnati, OH).\nSequence Analysis\nSequencing was performed to confirm the specificity of the RT-PCR assay using primers pairs for group 1 subtypes (HCoV-F2 and HCoV-R2) and for group 2 subtypes (HCoV-F1 and HCoV-R1) to amplify 823 bp and 912 bp fragments of the polymerase 1b gene of HCoVs, respectively, using Promega PCR Master Mix (Promega, Madison, WI) (Table 1). PCR products were purified and sequenced subsequently using BigDye terminator chemistry on an ABI PRISM 310 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems).\nSelected primers for the sequence detection of polymerase 1b gene.\nPrimer	Sequence, 5'  3'	HCoV subtype	Nucleotide positiona	 	HCoV-F1	TGAGTGATGATGGKGTTGT	2	15576-15594	 	HCoV-R1	GTTGCCTTTTGMGTTTCTG	2	16521-16503	 	HCoV-F2	GRGTTGAGTGTTATAGTGG	1	16151-16167	 	HCoV-R2	GCATGASTTGGTGGTAAA	1	16989-16972	 	\na Primers positions are given according to their position on the species OC43 and NL63 whole genome sequence, GenBank accession numbers KF923925.1 and KF530114.1.\nStatistical Analysis\nNumerical data were summarized with medians (interquartile range, IQR), categorical data with frequencies, and percentages. 95% confidence intervals (CI) for percentages were based on exact binomial distributions. Univariate comparisons were based on the Mann-Whitney test for numerical variables and on the chi-squared test for categorical variables.\nOdds ratios (OR) with a 95% CI were used to quantify the strength of association between categorical variables. Multivariable logistic regression was used to adjust the analyses for additional covariates (such as age and sex).\nMcNemar's chi-squared test was used to assess the association between categorical variables measured in the same patients (at baseline and at the follow-up visit, in NP swabs and stool samples).\nThe association between HCoVs positivity and seasonality was assessed using logistic regression, in which HCoVs positivity was the response variable and the calendar day of admission to hospital (number of days from the first of January) was the covariate, modelled using restricted cubic splines (RCS) with four knots. The aim of this analysis was to display graphically the estimated association was between HCoV positivity and calendar day. Using RCS we avoided the a priori assumption of linearity (on the logit scale) between the calendar day and HCoV positivity.\nThe association between HCoVs positivity at the follow-up visit and at baseline was estimated using a logistic regression model with HCoVs positivity at follow-up as the outcome variable and HCoVs positivity at baseline as covariate; the analysis was also adjusted for the children's sex and age. A similar multivariable logistic regression model was used to assess the association between HCoVs positivity at follow-up and baseline positivity for other viruses (RSV, hMPV, Inf, HBoV, hRV, PIV, Ad, and HCoVs).\nAll analyses were performed using R statistical language using the functions included in the base and in the stats packages. For restricted cubic splines we used the rcs() function from the rms package.\nResults\nPatients and controls\nDuring a 2-year period (from October 2009 to September 2011), 6164 children under 6 years of age were admitted to the Department of Infectious Diseases, including 814 children with a diagnosis of AB, 942 children with AGE, and 278 children with FS. Of 2034 patients with AB, AGE or FS, 718 (34.3%) were included in the study. The others were not enrolled because their parents did not consent to their inclusion in the study (1243 children) or because they did not pass stool during their hospital stay even though they were admitted for AGE (73 children).\nOf 809 children admitted for elective surgery and whose parents were asked to give consent for them to take part in the study, 156 (19.2%) were enrolled. The main reason for non-enrollment was that two other studies whose rules precluded inclusion in our study were being conducted simultaneously.\nThe median age of the study participants was 17.6 months (IQR: 10.5-25.8), with a female:male ratio of 1:1.6. Children with acute infections were younger than controls (median age 16.7 months, IQR: 9.6-23.4 months versus median age 25.8 months, IQR: 14.6-45.8 months, P&lt;0.001) and were less often boys (404/718 (56.3%) among cases and 132/156 (84.6%) among controls, P&lt;0.001).\nOf 718 children with infections, 308 (42.9%) had AB, 192 (26.7%) FS (132 (68.7%) simple, 60 (31.3%) complex), and 218 (30.4%) AGE. Some children had more than one clinical syndrome: 21 had AB and AGE, 8 had AB and FS, 21 had FS and AGE, and 1 child had clinical indications of all three syndromes. Children with AB were younger compared to the other two groups (AB: median age 11.7 months, IQR: 5-20; FS: median age 18.3 months, IQR 14.7-27.4; AGE: median age 19.5, IQR 13.8-28.3).\nSamples\n718 NP swabs and 677 blood samples were obtained from 718 children with AB, FS, and/or AGE at enrollment; in addition, a stool sample was acquired from 218/218 children with AGE. 156 NP swabs and 150 stool samples were acquired from the 156 children comprising the healthy control group.\nAt follow-up examination 14 days after initial testing, NP swabs were available for 537/718 (74.8%) children, including 237/308 (77%) patients having had AB, 143/192 (74.5%) patients that had suffered from FS, and 157/218 (72%) patients that had been hospitalized for AGE. In 514/537 (96%) children from whom NP swabs were acquired blood samples were also obtained. Children with follow-up data were younger than those without follow-up (2.5 months of average difference), but the two groups were comparable according to sex.\nHCoVs detection\nThe presence of HCoVs upon admission was established in 58/718 (8.1%, 95% CI: 6.2-10.3%) NP swabs obtained from patients with AB, FS, or AGE, and in 6/218 (2.7%, 95% CI: 1.0-5.9%) stool samples of children with AGE. The corresponding findings in the control group were 3/156 (1.9%, 95% CI 0.4-5.5%) and 1/150 (0.7%, 95% CI 0-3.6%) for NP swabs and stool specimens, respectively. All children included in the control group were asymptomatic on the day of sampling, but a detailed history revealed that in three cases parents recalled symptoms indicating respiratory or gastrointestinal infection within 14 days before sampling. HCoVs in NP swabs were detected more often in children with AB, FS, and AGE than in control group children (8.1% versus 1.9%, OR = 4.5, 95% CI: 1.4-14.5%, P = 0.01) and the magnitude of the association also remained similar when the analysis was adjusted for patients' age and sex (OR = 4.5, 95% CI: 1.3-15.2%, P = 0.02). The same was valid also for individual syndromes: FS (9.9% versus 1.9%, OR = 5.60, 95% CI: 1.63-19.29, P = 0.006), AGE (8.7% versus 1.9%, OR = 4.87, 95% CI: 1.42-16.75, P = 0.01), and AB (6.5% versus 1.9%, OR = 3.54, 95% CI: 1.04-12.11%, P = 0.04). The virus was not found in the blood of any patients with positive HCoV NP swab or stool sample results.\nPatients with FS (9.9%, 95% CI: 6-15) and AGE (8.7%, 95% CI: 5.3-13.2) had a higher probability of having a positive HCoVs result compared to those with AB (6.5%, 95% CI: 4.0-9.8) but the association was not statistically significant. Of 19 HCoVs positive children with FS 11 (57.9%, 95% CI: 33.5-79.8) had simple and 8 (42.1%) had complex febrile seizures (5 of these 8 children required anticonvulsant treatment), while in HCoVs negative children with FS 121/173 (69.9%, 95% CI: 62.5-76.7) had simple and 52/173 (30.1%) had complex FS (31 of these 52 required anticonvulsant treatment). In children with AGE, HCoVs were more often detected in NP swabs than in stool samples (19/218, 8.7%, 95% CI 5.3-13.2% in NP swabs versus 6/218, 2.7%, 95% CI 1.0-5.9% in stool samples; P&lt;0.001).\nAmong patients with established HCoVs in NP swabs, the estimated viral load was the highest in children with FS (median cycle threshold (Ct) value 27.8, IQR 27.45-36.02), followed by AGE (median 29.5, IQR 24.40-35.50) and AB (median 33.3, IQR 27.45-36.02). Ct values in the three children with positive HCoVs in NP swabs belonging to the control group were high (31.7, 33.4, and 39.3, respectively).\nMost HCoVs-positive cases were detected in winter (41/58, 70.7%) followed by spring (14/58, 24.1%), whereas only 3/58 (5.1%) cases were detected in autumn and none in summer. The association between HCoVs positivity and seasonality (calendar day of admission to hospital) was statistically significant (P&lt;0.001). More HCoVs-positive cases were detected in winter 2009/2010 (34/58, 58.6%) than in winter 2010/2011 (24/58, 41.4%). In both years the highest probability of HCoVs-positive results was estimated in February and March (Fig 1).\nSeasonal distribution of HCoVs-positive samples.\nHuman coronaviruses (HCoVs), acute bronchiolitis (AB), febrile seizures (FS), and acute gastroenteritis (AGE).\nOf 58 HCoVs detected in NP swabs obtained upon admission from patients with infection, 23 (39.6%) belonged to OC43, 19 (32.7%) to HKU1, 8 to NL63 (13.8%), and 5 (8.6%) to 229E, whereas 3 HCoV-positive NP samples remained untyped because of their low viral load (high Ct value). Three NP specimens contained two HCoVs in different combinations, including NL63/OC43, NL63/HKU1, and 229E/HKU1. The primary species was determined according to the Ct value (the species with the lower Ct value was interpreted as primary). OC43 was detected most frequently in children with FS (12/19, 63.1%), whereas HKU1 was the most common HCoV among children with AB (9/20, 45%) and AGE (7/19, 36.8%) (Table 2). Of four HCoVs detected in healthy controls one virus was typed as NL63, one as 229E, and two HCoVs remained untyped because of their low viral load.\nDemonstration of HCoVs species in NP swabs obtained from children with acute bronchiolitis (AB), febrile seizures (FS), and acute gastroenteritis (AGE).\n		AB	FS	AGE	Total	 	229E	Total	2/20, 10%	1/19, 5.3%	2/19, 10.5%	5/58, 8.6%	 		229E only	0/2	1/1	2/2	3/5	 		229E + additional virus(es)	2/2	0/1	0/2	2/5	 	HKU1	Total	9/20, 45%	3/19, 15.8%	7/19, 36.8%	19/58, 32.7%	 		HKU1 only	1/9	0/3	5/7	6/19	 		HKU1 + additional virus(es)	8/9	3/3	2/7	13/19	 	NL63	Total	5/20, 25%	0/19	3/19, 15.8%	8/58, 13.8%	 		NL63 only	0/5	0	0/3	0/8	 		NL63 + additional virus(es)	5/5	0	3/3	8/8	 	OC43	Total	4/20, 20%	12/19, 63.1%	7/19, 36.8%	23/58, 39.6%	 		OC43 only	0/4	6/12	5/7	11/23	 		OC43 + additional virus(es)	4/4	6/12	2/7	12/23	 	Untyped	Total	0	3	0	3/58, 5.2%	 		HCoVs only	0	2/3		2/3	 		HCoVs + additional virus(es)	0	1/3		1/3	 	\nUntyped, species not determined due to low viral load.\nPresence of additional viruses\nIn 36 (62.1%) of the 58 HCoVs-positive NP samples other respiratory viruses were detected, most commonly RSV (22/36, 61.1%) (Table 3). NL63 was most often (8/8, 100%) associated with other respiratory viruses, followed by HKU1 (13/19, 68.4%), OC43 (12/23, 52.2%), and 229E (2/5, 40%). 229E was detected as a single viral pathogen only in children with AGE and FS (Table 2).\nDemonstration of respiratory viruses in addition to HCoVs in NP swabs obtained from children with acute bronchiolitis (AB), febrile seizures (FS), and acute gastroenteritis (AGE).\n	AB	FS	AGE	Total	 	HCoV*	20/308 (6.5%)	19/192, 9.9%	19/218, 8.7%	58/718, 8.1%	 	HCoV only	1/20 (5%)	9/19, 47.4%	12/19, 63.1%	22/58, 37.9%	 	HCoV + additional virus(es)	19/20 (95%)	10/19, 52.6%	7/19, 36.8%	36/58, 62.1%	 	HCoV + 1 additional virus	13/19	5/10	3/7	21/36	 	HCoV + 2 additional viruses	5/19	2/10	3/7	10/36	 	HCoV + 3 additional viruses	1/17	0	1/7	2/36	 	HCoV + 4 additional viruses	0	3/10	0	3/36	 	Additional viruses:					 	AdV	4/19, 21%	5/10, 50%	3/7, 42.9%	12	 	InfA	0	1/10, 10%	1/7, 1.4%	2	 	InfB	0	2/10, 20%	0	2	 	PIV 1-3	0	0	1/7, 1.4%	1	 	RSV	15/19, 78.9%	5/10, 50%	2/7, 28.6%	22	 	hMPV	4/19, 21%	0	0	4	 	HBoV	1/19, 5.3%	3/10, 30%	2/7, 28.6%	6	 	hRV	1/19, 5.3%	2/8, 2%	3/7, 42.8%	6	 	\n*Proportion of patients with HCoV demonstrated in NP swab.\nAdV, adenovirus; InfA, influenza virus A; InfB, influenza virus B; PIV 1-3, parainfluenza virus 1-3, RSV, respiratory syncytial virus; hMPV, human metapneumovirus; HBoV, human bocavirus; hRV, rhinovirus.\nWithin HCoVs-positive patients those with AB had a significantly larger probability of having &quot;co-infections&quot; compared to other disease groups (19/20, 95%, 95% CI: 75.1-99.8%; 10/19, 52.6%, 95% CI: 28.9-75.6%; and 7/19, 36.8%, 95% CI: 16.4-57.3% in children with AB, FS, and AGE, respectively; P&lt;0.001). The association remained statistically significant also after adjustment for the children's age and sex.\nHCoVs median Ct values were 27.5 (IQR: 21.8-34.9) in single &quot;infections&quot; and 32 (IQR: 27-35.8) in &quot;co-infections&quot; (P = 0.09).\nFollow-up testing\nOf 537 follow-up NP swabs, 35 (6.5%, 95% CI: 4.6-8.9) were positive for HCoVs. The proportion was smaller compared to findings at baseline (58/718; 8.1, 95% CI: 6.2-10.3), but the difference was small and not statistically significant (P = 0.3). 14/35 (40%) HCoVs-positive children were asymptomatic but the others had respiratory and/or gastrointestinal symptoms. Only 10/35 (29%) were HCoVs-positive also at baseline. Patients that were HCoVs-positive at initial sampling were more likely to be HCoVs-positive at the follow-up examination (OR = 5.5 for HCoVs-positivity, 95% CI: 2.4-12.4, P&lt;0.001). The estimated association remained similar and statistically significant also when the analysis was adjusted for age and sex. A multivariable logistic regression model that included RSV, hMPV, Inf, HBoV, hRV, PIV, AdV, and HCoV at baseline as covariates revealed that patients that were HBoV-positive at the initial examination had more likely HCoVs-positive result at follow-up (OR = 4.3, 95% CI: 1.8 to 10.2, P&lt;0.001).\nThe Ct value measured for 10 patients that were HCoVs-positive both at baseline and follow-up are displayed graphically (Fig 2). All HCoVs species, except NL63, had higher Ct values at follow-up than at base line. In all nine patients that were positive for HCoVs at the initial and at follow-up sampling visit, and had known HCoV species, the same HCoV species was detected on both occasions.\nThe Ct value measured for HCoV-positive patients at baseline and follow-up examination in nasopharyngeal swabs.\nHCoV species were not determined due to low viral load (Untyped); HCoV species (229E, HKU1, NL63, OC43).\nNone of the 35 children positive for HCoVs at follow-up had viruses detected in blood samples taken at the same time.\nSequencing\nIn 12 HCoVs the 805-bp-long region of the polymerase 1b gene for coronaviruses from Alphacoronavirus and 912-bp-long region for coronaviruses from Betacoronavirus were amplified and sequenced. Five of 12 sequences were unique and were deposited in GenBank (acc. no. KF668028-KF668032).\nDiscussion\nHCoVs have been associated with a wide variety of clinical presentations, but their etiological role has not been fully elucidated and remains uncertain. In this study we determined the occurrence of the viruses by molecular method in NP swab and stool samples and tried to assess their etiological role in children under 6 years of age that were hospitalized for AB, AGE, or FS. For the appraisal of the causal relationship we: i) included a control group and compared the frequency of HCoVs in patients with their occurrence in healthy children; ii) searched for the presence of several other viruses that might also be the cause of the illness, and iii) determined the estimated viral load of HCoV nucleic acids present (measured as Ct value), based on the idea that a high viral load (low Ct value) more reliably suggests a causative role than a low viral load (high Ct value).\nThe presence of HCoVs was established upon admission to the hospital in 58/718 (8.1%, 95% CI: 6.2-10.3%) NP swabs. The proportion of positive results was the highest in children with FS (9.9%), followed by AGE (8.7%) and AB (6.5%), but the differences between the three groups were not statistically significant. HCoVs were more often detected in NP swabs of patients than in healthy controls (8.1% versus 1.9%, OR = 4.5, 95% CI: 1.4 to 14.5, P = 0.01). The same was valid also for all three clinical groups (FS, AGE, AB). Although these findings support the causal role of HCoVs in our patients, this role remained inconclusive due to frequent co-detection of other viruses. Namely, in 36 (62.1%) of the 58 HCoVs-positive NP samples other respiratory viruses were detected, most commonly RSV (22/36, 61.1%). Within HCoVs NP swab-positive patients those with AB had the largest probability of being &quot;co-infected&quot; with other viruses (19/20, 95%), followed by FS (10/19, 52.6%) and AGE (7/19, 36.8%). The fraction of &quot;co-infections&quot; established in our patients with FS and AGE is similar to that reported previously, whereas the proportion in children with AB is higher than in most other studies. NP swab HCoVs estimated viral load was the highest in patients with FS (median Ct value 27.8), followed by AGE (median Ct value 29.5) and AB (median Ct value 33.5). Viral load in single HCoV &quot;infections&quot; was higher than in &quot;co-infections&quot; (median Ct values 27.5 versus 32, respectively; P = 0.09). This finding is in contrast to previous studies, in which no difference in viral load in single HCoV &quot;infections&quot; and &quot;co-infections&quot; was found.\nOur findings suggest that in children with AB the presence of HCoVs in NP swabs is of minor importance and is most probably not causally related to AB because, among the three clinical groups, patients with AB had the lowest proportion of HCoV-positive NP swab results, very frequent &quot;co-infection&quot; with other respiratory viruses (95%), and very low viral load.\nInterpretation of the role of HCoVs in AGE is complex because the viruses were more often demonstrated in NP swabs than in stool samples (it has been suggested that HCoVs detected in stools may be there because of swallowing), because more than half of the children with AGE had also signs and symptoms of respiratory infection, because viral load was low and was higher in NP swabs than in stool samples, and because more than one-third of patients also had other viruses demonstrated in NP swabs. These findings suggest that HCoVs play only a minor role in gastrointestinal illness in children under 6 years old and go in parallel with the results of a Finnish study, in which HCoVs were more commonly detected in NP swabs than in stool samples in children with AGE, children with respiratory infection, and the group with combined gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms.\nIt seems that among three clinical syndromes an etiological role of HCoVs is most likely in children with FS: in this group of patients the proportion of positive HCoV NP swab results was higher than in patients with AB and those with AGE, and it was significantly higher than in control children. Patients with FS had the highest viral load, but the co-detection of other viruses was 52.6%. HCoVs are molecularly related in structure and mode of replication with neuroinvasive animal coronaviruses, the relatedness does also attest for neuroinvasiveness of HCoVs. Furthermore, since the pathogenesis of FS is not (primarily) based on neuroinvasiveness, this potential feature would not directly explain the association with FS.\nAt follow-up testing (14-days after the initial sampling), when 67.8% (364/537) of children were symptom-free, the proportion of HCoVs-positive results compared to baseline was smaller (35/537, 6.5% versus 58/718, 8.1%) but the difference was not statistically significant. Patients who were HCoVs-positive at the initial sampling were 5.5 times more likely to be HCoVs-positive at follow-up examination, and all first and follow-up detected viruses in individual patients were of congruent types. However, only 10/35 (28.6%) samples were positive on both occasions; in this subgroup the viral load was lower at follow-up than at initial testing (Fig 2). The increase in viral load was observed in only two samples; in both NL63 was demonstrated. At present we do not have a reliable explanation for the surprising finding that 25/35 (71.4%) samples were positive only at follow-up testing but not at the time of acute illness and that the occurrence of the positive results at follow-up testing (25/493, 5.1%) was higher than the occurrence 3/156 (1.9%), found in the control group (p = 0.043). This finding additionally complicates interpretation of the etiologic role of HCoVs.\nPrevious studies have reported on the seasonal appearance of HCoVs and their more pronounced occurrence every three to four years. A strong association with seasonality was also found in this study (P&lt;0.001); the majority of HCoVs was detected in February and March both years (Fig 1).\nOf 58 HCoVs detected in NP swabs obtained upon admission from patients with infections, 23 (39.6%) belonged to OC43, 19 (32.7%) to HKU1, 8 to NL63 (13.8%), and 5 (8.6%) to 229E, but 3 (5.2%) remained untyped because of their low viral load. All four HCoVs species were detected in each of the clinical manifestations; however, HKU1 was the most common HCoVs in children with AB (9/20, 45%) and AGE (7/19, 36.8%), whereas in children with FS OC43 was detected most frequently (12/19, 63.1%) (Table 2). These findings are in contrast to previous reports in which a lower detection rate of HCoVs and a predominance of HKU1 in children with FS was found. Analyzing published information on other syndromes revealed that in the group of children with combined gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms all four HCoVs were detected, whereas in those with solely gastrointestinal symptoms OC43, HKU1, and NL63 but not 229E were demonstrated; that in children with acute respiratory tract infections (lower and upper) all four HCoVs species were established and that the predominance of species varies with country, study period, and study population; and that in children with AB information on HCoVs species is rather limited.\nAmplification and sequencing of genes representative for Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus was performed in a subgroup of 12 HCoVs; in as many as 5/12 (41.7%) the sequences were unique.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, all four HCoVs were detected in children under 6 years old with AB, AGE, or FS. The presence of HCoVs and more frequent demonstration of these viruses in patients than in the control group of healthy children point toward an etiologic role of HCoVs. However, interpretation is complex. The causative role of HCoVs is most probably minor in children with AB and in patients with AGE but is more likely in children with FS, considering that they had a higher proportion of positive HCoVs results than patients with AB and those with AGE, and had the highest viral load; however, in half of the patients the co-detection of other viruses was established.\nSupporting

well-documented cases of pneumonia related to coronavirus 229E, each with a different clinical presentation.\n Diagnosis was made on the basis of viral culture and electron microscopy findings that

acute diarrhea and propagated in human rectal tumor (HRT?18) cells.\n Electron microscopy revealed coronavirus particles in the diarrhea fluid sample and the infected HRT?18 cell cultures.\n This virus possessed hemagglutinating and acetylesterase activities and caused cytopathic effects in HRT?18 cells but not in MDBK, GBK and FE cells.\n One of four S?specific monoclonal antibodies reacted in Western blots with HECV?4408, BCV?L9 and BCV?LY138 but not with HCV?OC43, and two reacted with BCV?L9 but not with HECV?4408, BCV?LY138 and HCV?OC43. One S?specific and two N?specific monoclonal antibodies reacted with all of these strains.\n cDNA encompassing the 3? 8.5 kb of the viral RNA genome was isolated by reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction amplification had size and restriction endonuclease patterns similar to those of BCV?L9 and BCV?LY138. In contrast, the M gene of HCV?OC43 differed in restriction patterns from HECV?4408 and BCV.\n A genomic deletion located between the S and M within the nonstructural genes of HCV?OC43 was not detected in HECV?4408. DNA sequence analyses of the S and HE genes revealed more than 99% nucleotide and deduced amino acid homologies between HECV?4408 and the virulent wild?type BCV.\n Forty?nine nucleotide and 22 amino acid differences were found between the HE genes of HECV?4408 and HCV?OC43, while only 16 nucleotide and 3 amino acid differences occurred between the HE genes of HECV?4408 and BCVLY138. We thus conclude that the strain HECV?4408 is a hemagglutinating enteric coronavirus that is biologically, antigenically and genomically more closely related to the virulent BCVLY138 than to HCV?OC43. © 1994 Wiley?Liss, Inc.\n","id":"PMC7166597","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Wiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Company","authors":[{"firstname":"X.

young children and immunosuppressed patients.\n Objectives: To rapidly and accurately quantify and subtype RSV in respiratory samples, we developed and evaluated two real-time RT-PCR assays.\n Study design: A quantitative assay was designed using primers for a consensus region of the matrix protein gene and a subtype-specific assay for RSV-A and RSV-B detection was designed using primers for the polymerase gene.\n Quantitative RSV RT-PCR results of pediatric nasal wash samples submitted to the University of Washington Virology Laboratory from December 2002, through May 2003, were compared to those of an indirect fluorescent antibody RSV antigen detection assay (FA).\n Results: Specificity of the RT-PCR assay was high, with no amplification of eleven common respiratory viruses and eight herpes viruses.\n Among 751 samples, RSV was detected in 267 (35.6%) by FA and in 286 (38.1%) by RT-PCR.\n Median RSV copy number in nasal wash samples that were positive by both FA and RT-PCR was 2.5×107 copies/mL versus a median of 3.0×104 copies/mL for samples positive by RT-PCR only (P&lt;0.001).\n The detection and quantity of RSV in respiratory specimens was associated with younger age, but not with gender or hospitalization.\n Among positive samples from this Seattle cohort, 52% were subtype A and 48% were subtype B.\n Both subtypes were detected with similar viral loads among all patient groups (stratified by age, gender, and hospitalization), and throughout the specimen collection period.\n Conclusions: These real-time RT-PCR assays provide a rapid, specific, and highly sensitive alternative for detecting, quantifying, and subtyping RSV in clinical specimens.\n","id":"PMC7128826","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

(49%; n?=?25/51).\n Follow-up samples were available from 22 patients with ARTIs.\n In three patients, hBoV DNA persisted for one month.\n Multiplex Q-PCR may help in closing the diagnostic gap by

Three different clinical evolutions are described: (1) two paucisymptomatic women diagnosed within a day of exhibiting symptoms, with high nasopharyngeal titres of SARS-CoV-2 within the first 24 h of the illness onset (5·2 and 7·4 log10 copies per 1000 cells, respectively) and viral RNA detection in stools; (2) a two-step disease progression in two young men, with a secondary worsening around 10 days after disease onset despite a decreasing viral load in nasopharyngeal samples; and (3) an 80-year-old man with a rapid evolution towards multiple organ failure and a persistent high viral load in lower and upper respiratory tract with systemic virus dissemination and virus detection in plasma.\n\n The 80-year-old patient died on day 14 of illness (Feb 14, 2020); all other patients had recovered and been discharged by Feb 19, 2020.\nInterpretation\nWe illustrated three different clinical and biological types of evolution in five patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 with detailed and comprehensive viral sampling strategy.\n\n We believe that these findings will contribute to a better understanding of the natural history of the disease and will contribute to advances in the implementation of more efficient infection control strategies.\n\n\nFunding\nREACTing (Research &amp; Action Emerging Infectious

there had been over 132?500 confirmed cases globally.\n Nevertheless, the case reports of children are rare, which results in the lack of evidence for preventing and controlling of children's infection.\n Here, we report three cases of SARS?CoV?2 infected children diagnosed from 3 February to 17 February 2020 in Tianjin, China.\n All of these three cases experienced mild illness and recovered soon after the treatment, with the nucleic acid of throat swab turning negative within 14, 11, and 7 days after diagnosis, respectively.\n However, after been discharged, all three cases were tested SARS?CoV?2 positive in the stool samples within 10 days, in spite of their remained negative nucleic acid in throat swab specimens.\n Therefore, it is necessary to be aware of the possibility of fecal?oral transmission of SARS?CoV?2 infection, especially for children cases.\n","id":"PMC7228213","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley and Sons

performed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.\n\n\nResults\nViral RNA was not detected in the 44 air samples.\n\n The positive rates in 200 environmental surface samples in medical areas (24.83%) was higher than that in living quarters (3.64%), with a significant difference (P &lt; .\n\n05).\n\n The positive rates were 25.00% and 37.50% for the general isolation ward and

Faecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from COVID-19 patients has extensively been reported.\n Therefore, we investigated the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in six wastewater treatments plants (WWTPs) serving the major municipalities within the Region of Murcia (Spain), the area with the lowest COVID-19 prevalence within Iberian Peninsula.\n Firstly, an aluminum hydroxide adsorption-precipitation concentration method was validated using a porcine coronavirus (Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus, PEDV) and mengovirus (MgV).\n The procedure resulted in average recoveries of 10 ± 3.5% and 10 ± 2.1% in influent water (n = 2) and 3.3 ± 1.6% and 6.2 ± 1.0% in effluent water (n = 2) samples for PEDV and MgV, respectively.\n Then, the method was used to monitor the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 from March 12 to April 14, 2020 in influent, secondary and tertiary effluent water samples.\n By using the real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) Diagnostic Panel validated by US CDC that targets three regions of the virus nucleocapsid (N) gene, we estimated quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA titers in untreated wastewater samples of 5.4 ± 0.2 log10 genomic copies/L on average.\n Two secondary water samples resulted positive (2 out of 18) and all tertiary water samples tested as negative (0 out 12).\n This environmental surveillance data were compared to declared COVID-19 cases at municipality level, revealing that members of the community were shedding SARS-CoV-2 RNA in their stool even before the first cases were reported by local or national authorities in many of the cities where wastewaters have been sampled.\n The detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater in early stages of the spread of COVID-19 highlights the relevance of this strategy as an early indicator of the infection within a specific population.\n At this point, this environmental surveillance could be implemented by municipalities right away as a tool, designed to help authorities to coordinate the exit strategy to gradually lift its coronavirus lockdown.\n","id":"PMC7229723","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

coronavirus disease?2019 (COVID?19).\n The infection due to this virus spread exponentially throughout China and then spread across &gt;205 nations, including the United States (US).\n Gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopies are routinely performed in the US and globally.\n Previous reports of isolated infection outbreaks were reported with endoscopes acting as potential vectors.\n While multidrug?resistant organisms have been reported to be spread by endoscopes, few cases of viruses such as hepatitis B and C are noted in the literature.\n COVID?19 is predominately spread by droplet transmission, although recent evidence has showed that shedding in feces and feco?oral transmission could also be possible.\n It is unclear if COVID?19 could be transmitted by endoscopes, but it could theoretically happen due to contact with mucous membranes and body fluids.\n GI endoscopies involve close contact with oral and colonic contents exposing endoscopy staff to respiratory and oropharyngeal secretions.\n This can increase the risk of contamination and contribute to virus transmission.\n Given these risks, all major GI societies have called for rescheduling elective non?urgent procedures and perform only emergent or urgent procedures based on the clinical need.\n Furthermore, pre?screening of all individuals prior to endoscopy is recommended.\n This article focuses on the risk of COVID?19 transmission by GI shedding, the potential role of endoscopes as a vector of this novel virus, including transmission during endoscopies, and prevention strategies including deferral of elective non?urgent endoscopy procedures.\n","id":"PMC7262209","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley and Sons

young children and immunosuppressed patients.\n Objectives: To rapidly and accurately quantify and subtype RSV in respiratory samples, we developed and evaluated two real-time RT-PCR assays.\n Study design: A quantitative assay was designed using primers for a consensus region of the matrix protein gene and a subtype-specific assay for RSV-A and RSV-B detection was designed using primers for the polymerase gene.\n Quantitative RSV RT-PCR results of pediatric nasal wash samples submitted to the University of Washington Virology Laboratory from December 2002, through May 2003, were compared to those of an indirect fluorescent antibody RSV antigen detection assay (FA).\n Results: Specificity of the RT-PCR assay was high, with no amplification of eleven common respiratory viruses and eight herpes viruses.\n Among 751 samples, RSV was detected in 267 (35.6%) by FA and in 286 (38.1%) by RT-PCR.\n Median RSV copy number in nasal wash samples that were positive by both FA and RT-PCR was 2.5×107 copies/mL versus a median of 3.0×104 copies/mL for samples positive by RT-PCR only (P&lt;0.001).\n The detection and quantity of RSV in respiratory specimens was associated with younger age,

real-time RT-PCR assays for detection of respiratory syncytial virus in respiratory specimens from children","abstract":"Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of lower respiratory tract morbidity in young children and immunosuppressed patients.\n Objectives: To rapidly and accurately quantify and subtype RSV in respiratory samples, we developed and evaluated two real-time RT-PCR assays.\n Study design: A quantitative assay was designed using primers for a consensus region of the matrix protein gene and a subtype-specific assay for RSV-A and RSV-B detection was designed using primers for the polymerase gene.\n Quantitative RSV RT-PCR results of pediatric nasal wash samples submitted to the University of Washington Virology Laboratory from December 2002, through May 2003, were compared to those of an indirect fluorescent antibody RSV antigen detection assay (FA).\n Results: Specificity of the RT-PCR assay was high, with no amplification of eleven common respiratory viruses and eight herpes viruses.\n Among 751 samples, RSV was detected in 267 (35.6%) by FA and in 286 (38.1%) by RT-PCR.\n Median RSV copy number in nasal wash samples that were positive by both FA and RT-PCR was 2.5×107 copies/mL versus a median of 3.0×104 copies/mL for samples positive by RT-PCR only (P&lt;0.001).\n The detection and quantity of RSV in respiratory specimens was associated with younger age, but not with gender or hospitalization.\n Among positive samples from this Seattle cohort, 52% were subtype A and 48% were subtype B.\n Both subtypes were detected with similar viral loads among all patient groups (stratified by age, gender, and hospitalization), and throughout the specimen collection period.\n Conclusions: These real-time RT-PCR assays provide a rapid, specific, and highly sensitive alternative for detecting, quantifying, and subtyping RSV in clinical specimens.\n","id":"PMC7128826","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

identify the seasonal peaks important for predicting disease and managing time-sensitive prophylaxis.\n For other viruses, such as rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, human bocavirus and parainfluenza virus type 4, culture and antigen-based procedures are not available and/or lack sensitivity.\n Thus such targets would be missed if NATs were not included in testing for surveillance and outbreak

demyelination.\n To examine the evolution of coronavirus RNA during chronic demyelinating infection, we isolated RNA from intracerebrally inoculated mice at 4, 6, 8, 13, 20, and 42 days postinfection and used reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction amplification methods (RT-PCR) to detect viral sequences.\n RNA sequences from two viral structural genes, the spike gene and the nucleocapsid gene, were detected throughout the chronic infection.\n In contrast, infectious virus was not detectable from brain homongenates beyond 13 days postinfection.\n These results indicate that coronavirus RNA persists in the brain at times when infectious virus is not detected.\n To determine if genetic changes were occurring during viral replication in the host, we cloned and sequenced the RT-PCR products from the spike and nucleocapsid regions and analyzed the sequences for mutations.\n Sequencing of the cloned products revealed that a variety of mutant forms of viral RNA persisted in the CNS, including point mutants, deletion mutants, and termination mutants.\n The mutations accumulated during persistent infection in both the spike and the nucleocapsid sequences, with greater than 65% of the mutations encoding amino acid changes.\n These results show that a diverse population or quasispecies consisting of mutant and deletion variant viral RNAs (which may not be capable of producing infectious virus particles) persists in the central nervous system of mice during chronic demyelinating infection.\n The implications of these results for the role of persistent viral genetic information in the pathogenesis of chronic demyelination are discussed.\n","id":"PMC7131440","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Academic

Deletion, by Reverse Genetics, Is Attenuating in the Natural Host","abstract":"In addition to a characteristic set of essential genes coronaviruses contain several so-called group-specific genes.\n These genes differ distinctly among the three coronavirus groups and are specific for each group.\n While the essential genes encode replication and structural functions, hardly anything is known about the products and functions of the group-specific genes.\n As a first step to elucidate their significance, we deleted the group-specific genes from the group 2 mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) genome via a novel targeted recombination system based on host switching (L.\n Kuo, G.\n J.\nGodeke, M.\n J.\n Raamsman, P.\n S.\n Masters, and P.\n J.\n M.\n Rottier, 2000, J.\n Virol.\n 74, 1393–1406).\n Thus, we obtained recombinant viruses from which the two clusters of group-specific genes were deleted either separately or in combination in a controlled genetic background.\n As all recombinant

of synthesis of defective viral RNAs","abstract":"The mechanism of synthesis of the defective viral RNAs in cells infected with defective-interfering (DI) particles of mouse hepatitis virus was studied.\n Two DI-specific RNA species, DIssA of genomic size and DIssE of subgenomic size, were detected in DI-infected cells.\n Purified DI particles, however, were found to contain predominantly DIssA and only a trace amount of DIssE RNA.\n Despite its negligible amount, the DIssE RNA in virions appears to serve as the template for the synthesis of DIssE RNA in infected cells.\n This conclusion was supported by two studies.\n First, the uv target size for DIssE RNA synthesis is significantly smaller than that for DIssA.\n Second, when purified DIssE RNA was transfected into cells which had been infected with a helper virus, DIssE RNA could replicate itself and became a predominant RNA species in the infected cells.\n Thus, DIssE RNA was not synthesized from the genomic RNA of DI particles.\n By studying the relationship between virus dilution and the amount of intracellular viral RNA synthesis, we have further shown that DIssE RNA synthesis requires a helper function, but it does not utilize the leader sequence of the helper virus.\n In contrast, DIssA synthesis appears to be helper-independent and can replicate itself.\n Thus DIssA codes for a functional RNA polymerase.\n","id":"PMC7131348","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Published by Elsevier

density in linear sucrose gradients of 1.17-1.18 g/cm3 and contain approximately 4% RNA by weight.\n The genomic ribonucleic acid of IBV shows the following characteristic: (1) It consists of one size class of single-stranded RNA having a molecular weight of 5.5-5.7 x 108 and a sedimentation coefficient of about 48 S; (2) no evidence for subunit structure is apparent since the RNA resolves as a

UTRs of BCoV and MHV have been previously shown to be interchangeable.\n Here, a reporter-containing BCoV DI RNA was shown to be replicated by all five BCoV-like helper viruses and by MHV-H2 (a human cell-adapted MHV strain), a representative of the MHV-like subgroup, demonstrating group 2 common 5? and 3? replication signaling elements.\n BCoV DI RNA, furthermore, acquired the leader of HCoV-OC43 by leader switching, demonstrating for the first time in vivo recombination between animal and human coronavirus molecules.\n These results indicate that common replication signaling elements exist among group 2 coronaviruses despite a two-cluster pattern within the group and imply there could exist a high potential for recombination among group members.\n","id":"PMC7126556","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Inc.","authors":[{"firstname":"Hung-Yi","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"James S","surname":"Guy","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Dongwan","surname":"Yoo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Reinhard","surname":"Vlasak","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ena","surname":"Urbach","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"David A","surname":"Brian","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Full-length genomic sequence of bovine coronavirus (31 kb)","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1074/jbc.M010923200","date":"1970-01-01","title":"In vitro RNA synthesis from exogenous dengue viral RNA templates requires long range interactions between 5'-and 3'-terminal regions that influence RNA structure","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1128/JVI.74.22.10600-10611.2000","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Strategy for systematic assembly of large RNA and DNA genomes: the transmissible gastroenteritis virus model","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1128/JVI.76.21.11065-11078.2002","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Systematic assembly of a full-length infectious cDNA of mouse hepatitis virus strain A59","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Specific binding of host cellular proteins to multiple sites within the 3' end of mouse hepatitis virus genomic RNA","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A 5'-proximal RNA sequence of murine coronavirus as a potential initiation site for genomic-length mRNA transcription","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1006/viro.1993.1465","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Presence of Subgenomic mRNAs in Virions of Coronavirus IBV","abstract":"The presence of subgenomic mRNAs in virions of IBV was examined by probing Northern blots of RNA extracted from virions using as a probe a cDNA of the 3?-terminal nucleocapsid protein (N) gene.\n This detects all five mRNAs because of the 3?-coterminal, nested-set arrangement of coronavirus mRNAs.\n The mRNAs were readily detected even after extensive purification of virions and after RNase A treatment of virions.\n In sucrose gradients the peaks of virus particles, genomic RNA (gRNA), and mRNAs were coincident.\n Cellular mRNA was not detected in virions.\n The molar ratio of gRNA to each mRNA ranged from about 10 to 30 for IBV-Beaudette and 25 to 800 for IBV-M41. The molar ratio of genomic to intracellular viral mRNAs was also determined.\n From this it was estimated that the efficiency of incorporation of gRNA into virions was at least 20- to 100-fold greater, depending on the mRNA species, for IBV-Beaudette and 100- to 500-fold for IBV-M41.

viral respiratory infections are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in humans worldwide.\n\n The etiological backgrounds of these infections remain unconfirmed in most clinical cases.\n\n The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of human coronavirus infections in a series of children hospitalized with symptoms of acute respiratory tract disease in a one-year period in Slovenia.\n\n\nMethods\nThe 664 specimens from 592 children under six years of age hospitalized at the University Children’s Hospital in Ljubljana were sent for the routine laboratory detection of respiratory viruses.\n\n Respiratory viruses were detected with a direct immunofluorescence assay and human coronaviruses were detected with a modified real-time RT–PCR.\n\n\nResults\nHCoV RNA was

practical so preferentially multiplex PCRs are used.\n\n\nObjectives:\nTo develop for routine diagnosis a rapid real-time PCR assay for detection of hRV and hMPV including an internal control in a single tube multiplex reaction using probes carrying different fluorophores to discriminate targets.\n\n\nStudy design:\nThe multiplex real-time RNA PCR was optimized to include the internal control

respiratory syncytial virus epidemics in 15 European countries, 2010 to 2016\nRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is considered the most common pathogen causing severe lower respiratory tract infections among infants and young children. We describe the seasonality and geographical spread of RSV infection in 15 countries of the European Union and European Economic Area. We performed a retrospective descriptive study of weekly laboratory-confirmed RSV detections between weeks 40/2010 and 20/2016, in patients investigated for influenza-like illness, acute respiratory infection or following the clinician's judgment. Six countries reported 4,230 sentinel RSV laboratory diagnoses from primary care and 14 countries reported 156,188 non-sentinel laboratory diagnoses from primary care or hospitals. The median length of the RSV season based on sentinel and non-sentinel surveillance was 16 (range: 9-24) and 18 (range: 8-24) weeks, respectively. The median peak weeks for sentinel and non-sentinel detections were week 4 (range: 48 to 11) and week 4.5 (range: 49 to 17), respectively. RSV detections peaked later (r = 0.56; p = 0.0360) and seasons lasted longer with increasing latitude (r = 0.57; p = 0.0329). Our data demonstrated regular seasonality with moderate correlation between timing of the epidemic and increasing latitude of the country. This study supports the use of RSV diagnostics within influenza or other surveillance systems to monitor RSV seasonality and geographical spread.\nBackground\nRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is considered the major pathogen causing severe lower respiratory tract infections among infants and young children. RSV is the most common cause of hospitalisation for acute lower respiratory tract infection in children younger than 5 years and is estimated to cause between 66,000 and 199,000 deaths worldwide every year. Its significance in causing substantial morbidity and hospitalisation in the first year of life has been affirmed in a recent study and a meta-analysis. In England, average annual hospital admission rates are 35.1 per 1,000 children younger than 1 year and 5.31 per 1,000 children aged 1-4 years. In addition to children, RSV causes a substantial disease burden in elderly people and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\nRSV causes seasonal epidemics worldwide, with one to two epidemics each year following latitudinal gradients in timing, duration, seasonal amplitude and between-year variability. In some studies, the seasonal periodicity has been connected to climatic factors, but a common factor that explains all observed periodicity has not been established. Meteorological conditions such as temperature and high relative humidity have been reported as important predictors of RSV epidemics. In the United States (US) and Japan, annual national and regional variation of RSV season onset and end has been reported. In the Nordic countries, a major outbreak often alternates with a minor one, with the minor peak in the spring and a major one the following winter, a phenomenon reported also in Croatia, Denmark and Germany. RSV antigenic groups A and B alternate in two-year cycles in Finland, with dominance of the group A viruses in years 1981-82, 1985-86 and 1989-90 and the group B viruses 1983-84 and 1987-88, and different genotypes dominate the circulation in consecutive epidemics in Korea. In Spain, no biennial rhythm has been detected but rather a stable annual epidemic with a peak between week 52 and week 1 and circulation 2-8 weeks earlier than influenza viruses. Similarly, in the United Kingdom (UK), one stable epidemic per year is observed.\nImmunoprophylaxis to prevent RSV infection with a neutralising monoclonal antibody, palivizumab, has been developed for administration to target groups on a monthly basis during the RSV season. However, this drug is limited to high-risk infants, the cost prohibits its use in low- and middle-income countries and the data on effectiveness of the drug in children at high risk other than infants born at gestational age &lt; 33 weeks and in children with chronic lung and heart diseases are limited. The demonstrated high disease burden of RSV infection has created a longstanding interest in RSV vaccines. Approximately 60 RSV vaccine candidates are in preclinical to phase III clinical trials, with potential target groups including elderly people, pregnant women and infants. A vaccine is expected to enter the market within 5-10 years, presumably by 2025. As natural infection provides only limited protective immunity owing to evolution of the surface protein G and alternating dominance of antigenic groups A and B, most of the vaccine candidates target the fusion protein F, which is cross-reactive across RSV subtypes. To circumvent issues with alternating strains, it has been also suggested to consider inclusion of both RSV A and B in a future RSV vaccine. To plan optimal future vaccination strategies, it is critically important to understand who is affected by RSV and to identify which groups are at risk of more severe RSV infection requiring hospitalisation or intensive care. RSV infection is not notifiable in the European Union (EU) and European Economic Area (EEA), except in Ireland, but many countries have a long tradition of reporting laboratory-confirmed RSV infections at national and international level. The European Influenza Surveillance Network (EISN) collects RSV data for the purpose of interpreting the reports of influenza-like-illness (ILI); these data can also be used to analyse seasonality of RSV.\nInter-country comparative analysis of seasonal circulation of RSV across Europe is lacking as most of the published literature focuses on individual countries. Our study describes the seasonality of RSV in 15 countries in the EU/EEA, specifically the start and peak of the season, length of the season and geographical spread, as a baseline description of RSV circulation in Europe. We further aimed to test if the data reported through influenza surveillance systems in use in EU/EEA countries are appropriate to analyse RSV seasonality, including more countries and a more detailed analysis than previous studies.\nMethods\nStudy design\nWe retrospectively studied laboratory-confirmed RSV detections reported weekly through EISN to the European Surveillance System (TESSy) hosted at the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) between week 40/2010 and week 20/2016.\nStudy population and data\nWe included reports of laboratory-confirmed RSV infection based on PCR, antigen detection, serum antibody detection or virus isolation. Clinicians used either case definitions for ILI or acute respiratory infection (ARI) as the indication for sampling, or their own judgment and diagnostic need rather than a specific case definition. The specimens received from clinicians were tested for RSV in local or national laboratories, and positive results were collected through national surveillance systems. Weekly aggregated data were reported from each participating country through TESSy and covered sentinel surveillance in primary care and/or non-sentinel surveillance in primary- and/or hospital-care facilities where sampling is done for diagnostic purposes. The EU/EEA countries' national operational contact points for influenza surveillance were consulted regarding the use of case definitions and diagnostic detection methods. The reports were dated by date of specimen collection or date of laboratory diagnosis.\nData were included if a country reported for a minimum of four seasons and 5 weeks per season, with at least 24 RSV detections per country, season and surveillance system.\nTo explore geographical spread of RSV infections across the EU/EEA over time, latitude and longitude of the population centre (barycentre) of each country in decimal degrees were identified. Barycentres were calculated based on the 1 km population density grid provided by Eurostat, using the 2011 population data, except for Iceland for which the latest available population data were from 2006.\nData analysis\nIn line with similar previous work, RSV epidemic seasons were defined as the weeks when RSV detections exceeded 1.2% of total RSV-positive specimens per country, surveillance system and season. RSV detections also had to exceed the threshold continuously during the season (one gap week was allowed). Sentinel and non-sentinel data were analysed separately. Average threshold values over the seasons were calculated separately per country and surveillance system.\nBased on the season-specific epidemic thresholds, we calculated the median weeks in which the RSV season started and peaked as well as the median length of the seasons. The start of the season was defined as the first week when the weekly RSV detections exceeded this threshold. The season peak was defined as the week in which the maximum number of RSV detections were reported. If two weeks had the same number of detections, the first week with this number was defined as the peak week. \nThe correlation between timing of the epidemic and distance of countries' barycentre from the equator (latitude) and Greenwich meridian (longitude) was studied by applying Pearson's correlation to the median start and peak weeks as well as the length of each RSV epidemic; this was based on data from 14 of the 15 participating countries providing non-sentinel data. Western longitudes were transformed to Eastern longitudes. Residues were tested for normal distribution by Shapiro-Wilk test. Any correlation (r) of 0-0.19 was regarded as very weak, 0.20-0.39 as weak, 0.40-0.59 as moderate, 0.60-0.79 as strong and 0.80-1 as very strong. The threshold of significance was set at p = 0.05. Fitted values of the correlation, the equation of the trend line and R2 values (goodness of fit of the regression line) were calculated. Data were analysed with Microsoft Excel 2013 and Stata 14.\nResults\nCountries reporting RSV detections\nFifteen EU/EEA Member States reported 160,418 RSV detections during the study period: 156,188 through non-sentinel systems (14 reporting countries) and 4,230 through sentinel surveillance systems (six reporting countries) (Table). At the non-sentinel sites, four countries used the ILI case definition only, four used the ILI and ARI case definitions and six used sampling for RSV based on clinical judgement without specific case definition (Table). At the sentinel sites, two countries used the ILI case definition only and four used both ILI and ARI case definitions. Eleven countries reported non-sentinel data for all six seasons (Table). The mean number of non-sentinel detections per season ranged from 117 in Iceland to 9,026 in France. The mean number of sentinel detections per season ranged from 37 in Estonia to 322 in France.\nRSV case definitions used for sampling, geographical location and numbers of RSV detections, by country and surveillance system, 15 EU/EEA countries, 2010-2016\nCountry name	Case definition for sampling	Surveillance system (sentinel or non-sentinel)	Latitude of the barycentre ( North)	Longitude of the barycentre ( East)	Number of RSV seasons included	Total number of detections	Mean number of detections per season	Minimum number of detections per season	Maximum number of detections per season	 	Malta	ILI	Non-sentinel	35.9	14.5	5	840	168	34	264	 	Portugal	ILI	Non-sentinel	39.7	-9.2	4	1,305	326	79	626	 	Spain	Laboratory-confirmed RSV infection; testing based on clinical judgement	Non-sentinel	39.7	-3.3	6	12,706	2,118	1,278	2,965	 	Slovenia	ARI, ILI	Sentinel	46.2	14.9	4	191	48	41	59	 	France	ARI, ILI	Non-sentinel	47.1	2.7	5	45,131	9,026	8,500	9,801	 	ARI, ILI	Sentinel	47.1	2.7	5	1,611	322	243	382	 	Germany	ILI	Non-sentinel	50.9	9.7	6	1,102	184	51	285	 	ARI, ILI	Sentinel	50.9	9.7	6	1,046	174	56	336	 	Poland	ILI	Non-sentinel	51.7	19.3	6	1,748	291	132	464	 	The Netherlands	Laboratory-confirmed RSV infection; testing based on clinical judgement or ARIa	Non-sentinel	52.1	5.3	6	11,715	1,953	1,402	2,760	 	ILI	Sentinel	52.1	5.3	5	200	40	32	50	 	United Kingdom	ARI, ILI	Non-sentinel	52.7	-1.6	6	50,716	8,453	4,747	10,999	 	ARI, ILI	Sentinel	52.7	-1.6	6	1,033	172	63	276	 	Ireland	Laboratory-confirmed RSV infection; testing based on clinical judgement; notifiable since 2012b	Non-sentinel	53.1	-7.4	6	4,443	741	547	945	 	Denmark	2010/11-2014/15: ARI, ILI; 2015/16: testing based on clinical judgementc	Non-sentinel	55.9	10.9	6	3,006	501	45	2,568	 	Latvia	Laboratory-confirmed RSV infection; testing based on clinical judgement	Non-sentinel	56.8	24.4	6	2,187	365	239	442	 	Sweden	Laboratory-confirmed RSV infection; testing based on clinical judgement	Non-sentinel	58.9	15.4	6	18,736	3,123	1,419	5,118	 	Estonia	ARI, ILI	Non-sentinel	59.0	25.5	6	1,849	308	177	373	 	ILI	Sentinel	59.0	25.5	4	149	37	34	48	 	Iceland	Laboratory-confirmed RSV infection; testing based on clinical judgement	Non-sentinel	64.4	-21.1	6	704	117	32	193	 	Total	Non-sentinel			6	156,188	1,977	32	10,999	 	Sentinel			6	4,230	132	32	382	 	\nARI: acute respiratory infection; EU/EEA: European Union/European Economic Area; GP: general practitioner; ILI: influenza-like illness; RSV: respiratory syncytial virus.\n\na ARI used in sentinel patients; however, RSV detections reported as non-sentinel detections.\n\nb Irish case definition for notification of RSV since 2012.\n\nc In seasons 2010/11 to 2014/15, all diagnostic (ARI/ILI) and sentinel specimens (ILI). In season 2015/16, all RSV-positive laboratory results from the Danish National Microbiology Database including detections from hospitals and GPs.\nIn Denmark, the surveillance system changed in 2015/16 from an ILI/ARI-based system to register-based retrieval of RSV-positive laboratory results from the Danish National Microbiology Database including detections from hospitals and general practitioners. Two countries, France and the UK, contributed 61% of the non-sentinel and 63% of the sentinel detections and therefore, their data influenced the overall European estimates the most.\nSeasonality\nSeasonality was observed by both types of surveillance (sentinel and non-sentinel) with the season threshold crossed in all countries in all years for both (Figure 1). All RSV seasons from 2010/11 to 2015/16 had a similar timing and epidemic course across Europe with some variation within and between countries (Figure 1). The highest numbers of detections were reported in seasons 2012/13, 2013/14 and 2015/16. In peak weeks, more than 2,500 specimens per week were reported positive for RSV. The lowest figures were observed in 2014/15 when France did not report RSV detections to TESSy because of a switch from one surveillance system to another during that season. Each year, the RSV epidemic in Europe progressed rapidly after week 40 to its peak and decreased to baseline levels only around week 20, which was probably driven by the later timing of the RSV epidemics in the countries with more northerly location (see below). Although the sentinel dataset was considerably smaller than the non-sentinel one, the sentinel detections followed similar patterns as non-sentinel detections and both showed a considerable effect of the end of year holiday period (weeks 52-1) (Figure 1 B) which is not as visible in the non-sentinel data (Figure 1 A). For the sentinel data, the decrease in detections during the end-of-year holiday period was mainly shown in data from Germany (Figure 1 B). While only eight detections of RSV in weeks 21-39 were reported from sentinel sources over the study period, RSV was detected by non-sentinel surveillance throughout the year, albeit at low levels (18 detections per week on average) during weeks 21-39. Compared with the remaining seasons, the season started 2-7 weeks earlier in Denmark, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Latvia, Malta, Poland and Sweden in 2012/13 and in Germany, Poland and Sweden in 2014/15 (Figure 1 A).\nNon-sentinel (n = 14 countries) and sentinel (n = 6 countries) RSV detections by country, season and week of detection, EU/EEA, 2010-2016\nEU/EEA: European Union/European Economic Area; RSV: respiratory syncytial virus.\nThe top left panel shows the pooled data for all included EU/EEA countries. Other panels show country-specific data by season.\nBased on analysis of the individual countries separately or as a group, the median start of the RSV season was in week 49 in both surveillance systems (ranging from week 41 to week 3 for the sentinel and from week 42 to week 8 for the non-sentinel data; Figure 2). The median peak week was in week 4 (range: 48 to 11) and 4.5 (range: 49 to 17), respectively, for sentinel and non-sentinel detections, roughly six weeks after the epidemic started. The median length of the RSV seasons based on sentinel and non-sentinel surveillance was 16 (range: 9 to 24) and 18 weeks (range: 8 to 24), respectively (Figure 2).\nTiming of RSV season as observed by non-sentinel (n = 14 countries) and sentinel (n = 6 countries) surveillance, EU/EEA, 2010-2016\nEU/EEA: European Union/European Economic Area; RSV: respiratory syncytial virus.\nLeft panels: median start week of RSV season start; middle panels: RSV season peak; Right panels: median RSV season length.

'All' shows median, minimum and maximum values of the pooled results from all countries per surveillance system.\nGeographical spread\nRSV detections peaked later with increasing latitude (Figure 3). There was a moderate positive correlation of latitude with the peak week (r = 0.56; p = 0.0360) and the length of the season (r = 0.57; p = 0.0329). This corresponds to earlier peak and shorter seasons in the southern parts of the EU/EEA. For start and peak of the season, there were moderate correlations (r = 0.52 and r = 0.47, respectively) to increasing longitude, although without statistical significance (p = 0.0563 and p = 0.0899, respectively). \nCorrelation between the RSV seasonal timing and geographical location of the reporting country, non-sentinel data, EU/EEA, 2010-2016 (n = 14 countries)\n E: degrees east;  N: degrees north; EU/EEA: European Union/European Economic Area; RSV: respiratory syncytial virus.\nThe dots represent the individual data points for each country. The linear regression line of the correlation with correlation coefficient (r) and p value are indicated in each graph.\nFor calculation purposes, the calendar weeks were transformed into running numbers starting with 1. Calendar week 40 thus became week number 1, calendar week 41 week 2 etc. Week 53 was removed from the dataset.\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we showed that in the 15 European countries reporting RSV surveillance data to the ECDC TESSy database, the average RSV season started in the beginning of December, peaked in early February and continued until early April, however, with wide variation between the countries. The data also showed a correlation between the earliest peak and a southerly latitude as well as between a longer season and a more northerly latitude. Furthermore, we showed that RSV seasonality can be captured through weekly reporting of RSV detections driven by diagnostic testing, using influenza ARI and ILI sentinel and non-sentinel surveillance systems. With these results, our analysis contributes to the understanding of the seasonality of RSV epidemics in Europe.\nAs previously shown in a global literature review and study, we confirmed in this study a latitudinal gradient of RSV epidemics peaking later and lasting longer with more northerly location of a country in the EU/EEA. We also showed a moderate correlation of the start and peak of the season with increasing longitude, although not statistically significant. The global study observed a weaker latitudinal gradient than our study, possibly because one third of the study sites were in the tropics. In our study, all reporting countries were from the temperate climate zone in the northern hemisphere. In the global study, the northern hemisphere temperate zone covered study sites from the US to Asia, and the range for median RSV peak time was from December to February, with an epidemic duration of up to six months. The peak of the RSV epidemic in our study as well as its duration of slightly over four months is well in line with the range presented in the review and in a study including seven countries from tropical and subtropical areas where the median length of a season was five months.\nThe median start week for RSV in Europe (week 49) was almost the same as for the US season which starts in week 51 (late December; range: weeks 46 to 3). The European and US epidemics both peak very close to each other: week 4 to 4.5 in our EU/EEA data and week 5 in the US. Regions of the US experience significant geographical variability in the start of the RSV season corresponding to changes in longitude and latitude: in the southern states, the season starts in late November, in the Midwest in early January and in Alaska between mid-October and late December. In the US, an overall south-to-north gradient is usually observed for the start of the RSV epidemic.\nThe length of 13-17 weeks of the RSV season in the US is a little shorter than what we observed (16-18 weeks). Interestingly, the RSV epidemics last longer in the south of the US than in the rest of the country. We observed the opposite, a statistically significant positive linear correlation between latitude and season length in the 14 studied EU/EEA countries, i.e. the further north the barycentre, the longer the RSV season. Further work is required to understand climatic and other factors which may be responsible for this correlation with latitude.\nTwo-year periodicity of RSV circulation has been observed in national studies in Croatia, Finland, Germany, Norway and Sweden. We observed an earlier start to the season only for the 2012/13 season in eight of the 15 countries and for 2014/15 in three countries. Some sporadic changes in the season start weeks and lengths were also observed.\nBefore the introduction of an RSV vaccine, RSV surveillance is required to document the baseline burden of disease, and the World Health Organization (WHO) is developing RSV surveillance and following the RSV vaccine development with interest. As no international RSV case definition has yet been agreed, the WHO has proposed candidate case definitions for severe and very severe RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infections as endpoints for RSV vaccine trials. Further work is required to determine the optimal case definitions that can be applied to RSV surveillance, especially surveillance of severe outcomes. We observed that the sentinel systems detected considerably fewer RSV cases than the non-sentinel system detections, which is a reflection of the sentinel system being designed to capture only a proportion of the population under surveillance and screening mostly for influenza. The overall low numbers in sentinel systems also reflect the lower number of participating countries, and therefore lower overall population size, reporting through such a surveillance system.\nOur study has a number of limitations that need to be considered when interpreting the results. Only 15 of the 30 EU/EEA Member States reported RSV detections and a large proportion originated from only two countries (France and UK), causing a skewed distribution. Therefore, results of this study should not be seen as representative for the entire EU/EEA, in particular for countries with smaller populations. No data on the patients' ages were available and therefore analysis by age group was not possible. TESSy did not have an RSV-specific denominator of specimens tested in this data collection period, nor a population denominator for RSV, and therefore proportions of positive specimens to define season start could not be calculated and weighting factors by population size could not be used. The weighting by population size could have benefited the study by removing the strong emphasis on the data from France and the United Kingdom. Using the published method for defining the epidemic threshold, the epidemic threshold depends on the total number of detections per country and season and may thus be very low in a small country or during a low-intensity RSV season. We acknowledge also that only Ireland applied an RSV-specific case definition, and because the majority of detections were from non-sentinel surveillance, most of the detections were collected based on a diagnostic need. As a large proportion of the data were collected as part of the national influenza surveillance systems, efforts should be made in the future to collect specimens specifically for RSV during the influenza season as focusing mainly on influenza may have caused a bias by detecting less RSV earlier during the autumn or later in spring. The surveillance systems and detection methods were not standardised for RSV detections, many systems changed during the study period and absolute numbers of detections may therefore not be comparable across countries or within countries over time. However, thresholds were calculated by season to detect start and peak of the RSV seasons even if a small number of detections were reported. As the EU ILI case definition that is not well-suited for RSV was applied in some countries, the absolute number of RSV detections may have been underestimated in these surveillance systems. Furthermore, virological data were not available and it would be of interest to study the seasonal patterns of RSV at the level of virus type and genetic clade.\nDespite these limitations, the present study showed that virological surveillance systems carried out by influenza reference centres or specialist and routine diagnostic laboratories that report laboratory-confirmed RSV infections can be used to monitor RSV seasonality, confirming findings of the European Influenza Surveillance Scheme. As the start of RSV monthly prophylaxis with palivizumab needs to be timed because the duration of protection is limited, according to the local circulation of the virus, knowing the seasonality at country level is of benefit for public health. At the European level, with RSV vaccines expected to come to the market in the next five to 10 years, it is crucial to establish a baseline for the number of RSV detections or for the weekly proportion of RSV-positive respiratory specimens to understand the extent of RSV circulation before implementing vaccination programmes. Further work is required to determine the design of optimal surveillance systems for RSV to measure the impact of future RSV vaccine programmes on different age groups and on the burden of severe disease. Additional benefits of establishing RSV surveillance standards at the European level include the ability to compare seasonality and trends between countries as well as virus typing and genetic characterisation, and to obtain standardised data on age groups at risk, such as newborns.\nEuropean Influenza Surveillance Network members from the contributing countries: Denmark: Ramona Trebbien, Hanne-Dorthe Emborg, Tyra Grove Krause and Thea K Fischer (Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen). \nEstonia: Natalja Kuznetsova, Liidia Dotsenko (Estonian Health Board, Laboratory of Communicable Diseases, Tallinn) and Olga Sadikova (Estonian Health Board, Department of CD surveillance and control, Influenza Centre, Tallinn). \nFrance: Sylvie Behillil (Unite de Genetique Moleculaire des Virus a ARN, UMR 3569 CNRS, Universite Paris Diderot SPC, Institut Pasteur, Paris; CNR des Virus Influenzae, Institut Pasteur, Paris), Thierry Blanchon (Sorbonne Universite, INSERM, Institut Pierre Louis d'Epidemiologie et de Sante Publique (IPLESP), F75012 Paris, France), Lisandru Capai (Sorbonne Universite, INSERM, Institut Pierre Louis d'Epidemiologie et de Sante Publique (IPLESP), F75012 Paris, France), F75012, Paris, ; EA7310, Laboratoire de Virologie, Universite de Corse-Inserm, Corte), Jean-Marie Cohen (Open Rome (Organize and Promote Epidemiological Network), Paris, France, Reseau des GROG, Paris), Vincent Enouf (Unite de Genetique Moleculaire des Virus a ARN, UMR 3569 CNRS, Universite Paris Diderot SPC, Institut Pasteur, Paris; CNR des Virus Influenzae, Institut Pasteur, Paris), Alessandra Falchi (EA7310, Laboratoire de Virologie, Universite de Corse-Inserm, Corte), Caroline Guerrisi (Sorbonne Universite, INSERM, Institut Pierre Louis d'Epidemiologie et de Sante Publique (IPLESP), F75012 Paris, France), Bruno Lina (Laboratoire de Virologie, CNR des virus influenza, Institut des Agents Infectieux, Groupement Hospitalier Nord des HCL, Lyon, Laboratoire Virpath, CIRI Inserm U1111, CNRS 5308, ENS, UCBL, Faculte de Medecine LYON Est, Universite de Lyon, Lyon), Thomas Hanslik (AP-HP, Hopital Ambroise Pare, Service de Medecine interne, F-92100 Boulogne Billancourt, France), Shirley Masse (Sorbonne Universite, INSERM, Institut Pierre Louis d'Epidemiologie et de Sante Publique (IPLESP), F75012 Paris, France; EA7310, Laboratoire de Virologie, Universite de Corse-Inserm, Corte), Anne Mosnier (Open Rome (Organize and Promote Epidemiological Network), Paris, France; Reseau des GROG, Paris), Clement Turbelin (Sorbonne Universite, INSERM, Institut Pierre Louis d'Epidemiologie et de Sante Publique (IPLESP), F75012 Paris, France), Martine Valette (Laboratoire de Virologie, CNR des virus influenza, Institut des Agents Infectieux, Groupement Hospitalier Nord des HCL, Lyon, Laboratoire Virpath, CIRI Inserm U1111, CNRS 5308, ENS, UCBL, Faculte de Medecine LYON Est, Universite de Lyon, Lyon), Sylvie van der Werf (Unite de Genetique Moleculaire des Virus a ARN, UMR 3569 CNRS, Universite Paris Diderot SPC, Institut Pasteur, Paris; CNR des Virus Influenzae, Institut Pasteur, Paris). \nGermany: Brunhilde Schweiger, Janine Reiche, Barbara Biere (National Influenza Centre, Robert Koch Institute, Berlin) and Silke Buda (Respiratory Infections Unit, Department for Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Robert Koch Institute, Berlin). \nIceland: Gudrun Erna Baldvinsdottir (Department of Clinical Microbiology at Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik). \nIreland: Lisa Domegan and Joan O Donnell (HSE-Health Protection Surveillance Centre, Dublin), Christina Byrne, Paul O'Reilly, Joanne Moran, Allison Waters and Cillian de Gascun (National Virus Reference Laboratory, University College Dublin, Dublin). \nLatvia: Natalija Zamjatina and Gatis Pakarna (Riga East University Hospital, Latvian Centre of Infectious Diseases, Riga) and Raina Nikiforova (Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, Riga). \nMalta: Jackie Maistre Melillo and Tanya Melillo (Infectious Disease Prevention and Control Unit, Msida). \nThe Netherlands: Adam Meijer (Centre for Infectious Diseases Research, Diagnostics and Laboratory Surveillance, National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), Bilthoven), Anne Teirlinck (Centre for Infectious Diseases, Epidemiology and Surveillance, RIVM) and Ge Donker (NIVEL, Netherlands Institute for Health Services Research, Utrecht). \nPoland: Lidia B.

burden of acute lower respiratory infections due to respiratory syncytial virus in young children: a systematic review and meta-analysis","abstract":"Background\nThe global burden of disease attributable to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) remains unknown.\n\n We aimed to estimate the global incidence of and mortality from episodes of acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) due to RSV in children younger than 5 years in 2005.\nMethods\nWe estimated the incidence of RSV-associated ALRI in children younger than 5 years, stratified by age, using data from a systematic review of studies published between January, 1995, and June, 2009, and ten unpublished population-based studies.\n\n We estimated possible boundaries for RSV-associated ALRI mortality by combining case fatality ratios with incidence estimates from hospital-based reports from published and unpublished studies and identifying studies with population-based data for RSV seasonality and monthly ALRI mortality.\n\n\nFindings\nIn 2005, an estimated 33·8 (95% CI 19·3–46·2) million new episodes of RSV-associated ALRI occurred worldwide in children younger than 5 years (22% of ALRI episodes), with at least 3·4 (2·8–4·3) million episodes representing severe RSV-associated ALRI necessitating hospital admission.\n\n We estimated that 66?000–199?000 children younger than 5 years died from RSV-associated ALRI in 2005, with 99% of these deaths occurring in developing countries.\n\n Incidence and mortality can vary substantially from year to year in any one setting.\n\n\nInterpretation\nGlobally, RSV is the most common cause of childhood ALRI and a major cause of admission to hospital as a result of severe ALRI.\n\n Mortality data suggest that RSV is an important cause of death in childhood from ALRI, after pneumococcal pneumonia and Haemophilus influenzae type b.\n\n The development of novel prevention and treatment strategies should be accelerated as a priority.\n\n\nFunding\nWHO; Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2864404","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Lancet Publishing

syncytial virus (RSV) is a major public health burden worldwide.\n We aimed to review the current literature on the incidence and mortality of severe RSV in children globally.\n Methods: Systematic literature review and meta?analysis of published data from 2000 onwards, reporting on burden of acute respiratory infection (ARI) due to RSV in children.\n Main outcomes were hospitalization for severe RSV?ARI and death.\n Results: Five thousand two hundred and seventy?four references were identified.\n Fifty?five studies were included from 32 countries.\n The global RSV?ARI hospitalization estimates, reported per 1,000 children per year (95% Credible Interval (CrI), were 4.37 (2.98, 6.42) among children &lt;5 years, 19.19 (15.04, 24.48) among children &lt;1 year, 20.01 (9.65, 41.31) among children &lt;6 months and 63.85 (37.52, 109.70) among premature children &lt;1 year.\n The RSV?ARI global case?fatality estimates, reported per 1,000 children, (95% Crl) were 6.21 (2.64, 13.73) among children &lt;5 years, 6.60 (1.85, 16.93) for children &lt;1 year, and 1.04 (0.17, 12.06) among preterm children &lt;1 year.\n Conclusions: A substantial proportion of RSV?associated morbidity occurs in the first year of life, especially in children born prematurely.\n These data affirm the importance of RSV disease in the causation of hospitalization and as a significant contributor to pediatric mortality and further demonstrate gestational age as a critical determinant of disease severity.\n An important limitation of case?fatality ratios is the absence of individual patient characteristics of non?surviving patients.\n Moreover, case?fatality ratios cannot be translated to population?based mortality.\n Pediatr Pulmonol.\n 2017;52:556–569. © 2016 The Authors.\n Pediatric

lower respiratory infections due to respiratory syncytial virus in young children in 2015: a systematic review and modelling study","abstract":"Background\nWe have previously estimated that respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was associated with 22% of all episodes of (severe) acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) resulting in 55?000 to 199?000 deaths in children younger than 5 years in 2005. In the past 5 years, major research activity on RSV has yielded substantial new data from developing countries.\n\n With a considerably expanded dataset from a large international collaboration, we aimed to estimate the global incidence, hospital admission rate, and mortality from RSV-ALRI episodes in young children in 2015.\nMethods\nWe estimated the incidence and hospital admission rate of RSV-associated ALRI (RSV-ALRI) in children younger than 5 years stratified by age and World Bank income regions from a systematic review of studies published between Jan 1, 1995, and Dec 31, 2016, and unpublished data from 76 high quality population-based studies.\n\n We estimated the RSV-ALRI incidence for 132 developing countries using a risk factor-based model and 2015 population estimates.\n\n We estimated the in-hospital RSV-ALRI mortality by combining in-hospital case fatality ratios with hospital admission estimates from hospital-based (published and unpublished) studies.\n\n We also estimated overall RSV-ALRI mortality by identifying studies reporting monthly data for ALRI mortality in the community and RSV activity.\n\n\nFindings\nWe estimated that globally in 2015, 33·1 million (uncertainty range [UR] 21·6–50·3) episodes of RSV-ALRI, resulted in about 3·2 million (2·7–3·8) hospital admissions, and 59?600 (48?000–74?500) in-hospital deaths in children younger than 5 years.\n\n In children younger than 6 months, 1·4 million (UR 1·2–1·7) hospital admissions, and 27?300 (UR 20?700–36?200) in-hospital deaths were due to RSV-ALRI.\n\n We also estimated that the overall RSV-ALRI mortality could be as high as 118?200 (UR 94?600–149?400).\n\n Incidence and mortality varied substantially from year to year in any given population.\n\n\nInterpretation\nGlobally, RSV is a common cause of childhood ALRI and a major cause of hospital admissions in young children, resulting in a substantial burden on health-care services.\n\n About 45% of hospital admissions and in-hospital deaths due to RSV-ALRI occur in children younger than 6 months.\n\n An effective maternal RSV vaccine or monoclonal antibody could have a substantial effect on disease burden in this age group.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Bill &amp; Melinda Gates

analysis","abstract":"Background\nid='P3'>Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of acute\nlower respiratory infection in young children.\n\n We previously estimated that\nin 2015, 33·1 million episodes of RSV-associated acute lower\nrespiratory infection occurred in children aged 0–60 months,\nresulting in a total of 118 200 deaths worldwide.\n\n Since then, several\ncommunity surveillance studies have been done to obtain a more precise\nestimation of RSV associated community deaths.\n\n We aimed to update\nRSV-associated acute lower respiratory infection morbidity and mortality at\nglobal, regional, and national levels in children aged 0–60 months\nfor 2019, with focus on overall mortality and narrower infant age groups\nthat are targeted by RSV prophylactics in development.\n\n\nMethods\nid='P4'>In this systematic analysis, we expanded our global RSV disease\nburden dataset by obtaining new data from an updated search for papers\npublished between Jan 1, 2017, and Dec 31, 2020, from MEDLINE, Embase,\nGlobal Health, CINAHL, Web of Science, LILACS, OpenGrey, CNKI, Wanfang, and\nChongqingVIP.\n\n We also included unpublished data from RSV GEN collaborators.\n\n\nEligible studies reported data for children aged 0–60 months with RSV\nas primary infection with acute lower respiratory infection in community\nsettings, or acute lower respiratory infection necessitating hospital\nadmission; reported data for at least 12 consecutive months, except for\nin-hospital case fatality ratio (CFR) or for where RSV seasonality is\nwell-defined; and reported incidence rate, hospital admission rate, RSV\npositive proportion in acute lower respiratory infection hospital admission,\nor in-hospital CFR.\n\n Studies were excluded if case definition was not clearly\ndefined or not consistently applied, RSV infection was not laboratory\nconfirmed or based on serology alone, or if the report included fewer than\n50 cases of acute lower respiratory infection.\n\n We applied a generalised\nlinear mixed-effects model (GLMM) to estimate RSV-associated acute lower\nrespiratory infection incidence, hospital admission, and in-hospital\nmortality both globally and regionally (by country development status and by\nWorld Bank Income Classification) in 2019. We estimated country-level\nRSV-associated acute lower respiratory infection incidence through a\nrisk-factor based model.\n\n We developed new models (through GLMM) that\nincorporated the latest RSV community mortality data for estimating overall\nRSV mortality.\n\n This review was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42021252400).\n\n\nFindings\nid='P5'>In addition to 317 studies included in our previous review, we\nidentified and included 113 new eligible studies and unpublished data from\n51 studies, for a total of 481 studies.\n\n We estimated that globally in 2019,\nthere were 33·0 million RSV-associated acute lower respiratory\ninfection episodes (uncertainty range [UR] 25·4–44·6\nmillion), 3·6 million RSV-associated acute lower respiratory\ninfection hospital admissions (2·9–4·6 million), 26 300\nRSV-associated acute lower respiratory infection in-hospital deaths (15\n100–49 100), and 101 400 RSV-attributable overall deaths (84\n500–125 200) in children aged 0–60 months.\n\n In infants aged\n0–6 months, we estimated that there were 6·6 million\nRSV-associated acute lower respiratory infection episodes\n(4·6–9·7 million), 1·4 million RSV-associated\nacute lower respiratory infection hospital admissions\n(1·0–2·0 million), 13 300 RSV-associated acute lower\nrespiratory infection inhospital deaths (6800–28 100), and 45700\nRSV-attributable overall deaths (38 400–55 900).\n\n 2·0% of\ndeaths in children aged 0–60 months (UR 1·6–2·4)\nand 3·6% of deaths in children aged 28 days to 6 months\n(3·0–4·4) were attributable to RSV.\n\n More than 95% of\nRSV-associated acute lower respiratory infection episodes and more than 97%\nof RSV-attributable deaths across all age bands were in low-income and\nmiddle-income countries (LMICs).\n\n\nInterpretation\nid='P6'>RSV contributes substantially to morbidity and mortality burden\nglobally in children aged 0–60 months, especially during the first 6\nmonths of life and in LMICs.\n\n We highlight the striking overall mortality\nburden of RSV disease worldwide, with one in every 50 deaths in children\naged 0–60 months and one in every 28 deaths in children aged 28 days\nto 6 months attributable to RSV.\n\n For every RSV-associated acute lower\nrespiratory infection in-hospital death, we estimate approximately three\nmore deaths attributable to RSV in the community.\n\n RSV passive immunisation\nprogrammes targeting protection during the first 6 months of life could have\na substantial effect on reducing RSV disease burden, although more data are\nneeded to understand the implications of the potential age-shifts in peak\nRSV burden to older age when these are implemented.\n\n\nFunding\nid='P7'>EU Innovative Medicines Initiative Respiratory Syncytial Virus\nConsortium in Europe

attributable to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) remains unknown.\n\n We aimed to estimate the global incidence of and mortality from episodes of acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) due to RSV in children younger than 5 years in 2005.\nMethods\nWe estimated the incidence of RSV-associated ALRI in children younger than 5 years, stratified by age, using data from a systematic review of studies published between January, 1995, and June, 2009, and ten unpublished population-based studies.\n\n We estimated possible boundaries for RSV-associated ALRI mortality by combining case fatality ratios with incidence estimates from hospital-based reports from published and unpublished studies and identifying studies with population-based data for RSV seasonality and monthly ALRI mortality.\n\n\nFindings\nIn 2005, an estimated 33·8 (95% CI 19·3–46·2) million new episodes of RSV-associated ALRI occurred worldwide in children younger than 5 years (22% of ALRI episodes), with at least 3·4 (2·8–4·3) million episodes representing severe RSV-associated ALRI necessitating hospital admission.\n\n We estimated that 66?000–199?000 children younger than 5 years died from RSV-associated ALRI in 2005, with 99% of these deaths occurring in developing countries.\n\n Incidence and mortality can vary substantially from year to year in any one setting.\n\n\nInterpretation\nGlobally, RSV is the most common cause of childhood ALRI and a major cause of admission to hospital as a result of severe ALRI.\n\n Mortality data suggest that RSV is an important cause of death in childhood from ALRI, after pneumococcal pneumonia and Haemophilus influenzae type b.\n\n The development of novel prevention and treatment strategies should be accelerated

2021. An online questionnaire was developed following three meetings of the Taskforce panellists wherein factors related to RSV infection, its prevention and management were identified using iterative questioning.\n\n Each factor was scored, by non-panellists interested in RSV, on a scale of zero (very-low-relevance) to 100 (very-high-relevance) within two scenarios: (1) Current and (2) Future expectations for RSV management.\n\n\nResults\nNinety questionnaires were completed: 70 by respondents (71.4% physicians; 27.1% researchers/scientists) from 16 LMICs and 20 from nine high-income (HI) countries (90.0% physicians; 5.0% researchers/scientists), as a reference group.\n\n Within LMICs, RSV awareness was perceived to be low, and management was not prioritised.\n\n Of the 100 factors scored, those related to improved diagnosis particularly access to affordable point-of-care diagnostics, disease burden data generation, clinical and general education, prompt access to new interventions, and engagement with policymakers/payers were identified of paramount importance.\n\n There was a strong need for clinical education and local data generation in the lowest economies, whereas upper-middle income countries were more closely aligned with HI countries in terms of current RSV service provision.\n\n\nConclusion\nSeven key actions for improving RSV prevention and management in LMICs are proposed.\n\n\n","id":"PMC9682277","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Frontiers Media S.A.","authors":[{"firstname":"Xavier","surname":"Carbonell-Estrany","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Eric A.

targeted at SARS-CoV-2 have affected the activity of other respiratory pathogens.\n\n We describe changes in the epidemiology of RSV among children younger than 5 years in England since 2020.\nMethods\nSurveillance data on RSV infections, comprising laboratory-confirmed cases, proportion of positive tests, hospital admissions for RSV-attributable illness, and syndromic indicators for RSV-associated disease (emergency department attendances for acute bronchitis or bronchiolitis, non-emergency health advice telephone service [NHS 111] calls for cough, general practitioner [GP] in-hours consultations for respiratory tract infections, and GP out-of-hours contacts for acute bronchitis or bronchiolitis) were analysed from Dec 29, 2014 to March 13, 2022, for children younger than 5 years.\n\n Data were extracted from national laboratory, clinical, and syndromic surveillance systems.\n\n Time-series analyses using generalised linear models were used to estimate the effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions targeting SARS-CoV-2 on RSV indicators, with absolute and relative changes calculated by comparing observed and predicted values.\n\n\nFindings\nRSV-associated activity was reduced for all RSV indicators during winter 2020–21 in England, with 10?280 (relative change –99·5% [95% prediction interval –100·0 to –99·1]) fewer laboratory-confirmed cases, 22·2 (–99·6%) percentage points lower test positivity, 92?530 (–80·8% [–80·9 to –80·8]) fewer hospital admissions, 96?672 (–73·7% [–73·7 to –73·7]) fewer NHS 111 calls, 2924 (–88·8% [–90·4 to –87·2]) fewer out-of-hours GP contacts, 91?304 (–89·9% [–90·0 to –89·9]) in-hours GP consultations, and 27?486 (–85·3% [–85·4 to –85·2]) fewer emergency department attendances for children younger than 5 years compared with predicted values based on winter seasons before the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n An unprecedented summer surge of RSV activity occurred in 2021, including 11?255 (1258·3% [1178·3 to 1345·8]) extra laboratory-confirmed cases, 11·6 percentage points (527·3%) higher test positivity, 7604 (10·7% [10·7 to 10·8]) additional hospital admissions, 84?425 (124·8% [124·7 to 124·9]) more calls to NHS 111, 409 (39·0% [36·6 to 41·8]) more out-of-hours GP contacts, and 9789 (84·9% [84·5 to 85·4]) more emergency department attendances compared with the predicted values, although there were 21?805 (–34·1% [–34·1 to –34·0]) fewer in-hours GP consultations than expected.\n\n Most indicators were also lower than expected in winter 2021–22, although to a lesser extent than in winter 2020–21.\nInterpretation\nThe extraordinary absence of RSV during winter 2020–21 probably resulted in a cohort of young children without natural immunity to RSV, thereby raising the potential for increased RSV incidence, out-of-season activity, and health-service pressures when measures to restrict SARS-CoV-2 transmission were relaxed.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC9762748","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Published by Elsevier

severe RSV in children globally.\n Methods: Systematic literature review and meta?analysis of published data from 2000 onwards, reporting on burden of acute respiratory infection (ARI) due to RSV in children.\n Main outcomes were hospitalization for severe RSV?ARI and death.\n Results: Five thousand two hundred and seventy?four references were identified.\n Fifty?five studies were included from 32 countries.\n The global RSV?ARI hospitalization estimates, reported per 1,000 children per year (95% Credible Interval (CrI), were 4.37 (2.98, 6.42) among children &lt;5 years, 19.19 (15.04, 24.48)

Review","abstract":"Background\nThere is limited information on influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) seasonal patterns in tropical areas, although there is renewed interest in understanding the seasonal drivers of respiratory viruses.\n\n\nMethods\nWe review geographic variations in seasonality of laboratory-confirmed influenza and RSV epidemics in 137 global locations based on literature review and electronic sources.\n\n We assessed peak timing and epidemic duration and explored their association with geography and study settings.\n\n We fitted time series model to weekly national data available from the WHO influenza surveillance system (FluNet) to further characterize seasonal parameters.\n\n\nResults\nInfluenza and RSV activity consistently peaked during winter months in temperate locales, while there was greater diversity in the tropics.\n\n Several temperate locations experienced semi-annual influenza activity with peaks occurring in winter and summer.\n\n Semi-annual activity was relatively common in tropical areas of Southeast Asia for both viruses.\n\n Biennial cycles of RSV activity were identified in Northern Europe.\n\n Both viruses exhibited weak latitudinal gradients in the timing of epidemics by hemisphere, with peak timing occurring later in the calendar year with increasing latitude (P&lt;0.03).\n\n Time series model applied to influenza data from 85 countries confirmed the presence of latitudinal gradients in timing, duration, seasonal amplitude, and between-year variability of epidemics.\n\n Overall, 80% of tropical locations experienced distinct RSV seasons lasting 6 months or less, while the percentage was 50% for influenza.\n\n\nConclusion\nOur review combining literature and electronic data sources suggests that a large fraction of tropical locations experience focused seasons of respiratory virus activity in individual years.\n\n Information on seasonal patterns remains limited in large undersampled regions, included Africa and Central America.\n\n Future studies should attempt to link the observed latitudinal gradients in seasonality of viral epidemics with climatic and population factors, and explore regional differences in disease transmission dynamics and attack rates.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3573019","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

Palivizumab is recommended in the period with high risk of RSV infection.\n\n This study aims to define the period for the southern part of Germany (Stuttgart area).\n\n\nMethods\nEpidemiological analysis of the RSV situation in southern Germany from 1996 to 2004 and comparison of results with literature was made.\n\n The respiratory tract specimens were sent in for the detection of RSV mainly by paediatric clinics.\n\n Detection of RSV was carried out mainly by real-time RT-PCR or by ELISA 'Pathfinder'.\n\n RSV outbreaks were depicted as an absolute number and as a percentage of RSV diagnoses in a month.\n\n Onsets, offsets, peaks, duration and severity of RSV seasons were defined and analysed.\n\n\nResults\nAn early season with strong RSV activity (early-high phase) was followed by a weaker late season (late-low phase) in a regular biennial rhythm.\n\n However, onsets, offsets and durations of outbreaks varied significantly from year to year.\n\n RSV epidemics in southern Germany were found to oscillate in an antiphase with RSV epidemics in Finland and Sweden.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe long-term regular biennial rhythm allows predicting whether the next outbreak will be late or early and whether RSV activity will be strong or weak.\n\n Not foreseeable, however, is the precise time of increase and decrease of RSV activity.\n\n Moreover, the regular seasonal pattern may be disrupted by irregular outbreaks.\n\n Thus, activity of RSV has to be monitored every year to define the period with high risk of infection.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1084247","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

and meta-analysis","abstract":"Background\nThe global burden of disease attributable to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) remains unknown.\n\n We aimed to estimate the global incidence of and mortality from episodes of acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) due to RSV in children younger than 5 years in 2005.\nMethods\nWe estimated the incidence of RSV-associated ALRI in children younger than 5 years, stratified by age, using data from a systematic review of studies published between January, 1995, and June, 2009, and ten unpublished population-based studies.\n\n We estimated possible boundaries for RSV-associated ALRI mortality by combining case fatality ratios with incidence estimates from hospital-based reports from published and unpublished studies and identifying studies with population-based data for RSV seasonality and monthly ALRI mortality.\n\n\nFindings\nIn 2005, an estimated 33·8 (95% CI 19·3–46·2) million new episodes of RSV-associated ALRI occurred worldwide in children younger than 5 years (22% of ALRI episodes), with at least 3·4 (2·8–4·3) million episodes representing severe RSV-associated ALRI necessitating hospital admission.\n\n We estimated that

globally prevalent cause of lower respiratory infection in neonates and infants.\n Despite its disease burden, a safe and effective RSV vaccine has remained elusive.\n In recent years, improved understanding of RSV biology and innovations in immunogen design has resulted in the advancement of multiple vaccine candidates into the clinical development pipeline.\n Given the growing number of vaccines in clinical trials, the rapid pace at which they are being tested, and the likelihood that an RSV vaccine will reach the commercial market in the next 5–10 years, consensus and guidance on clinical development pathways and licensure routes are needed now, before large-scale efficacy trials commence.\n In pursuit of this aim, the World Health Organization convened the first RSV vaccine consultation in 15 years on the 23rd and 24th of March, 2015 in Geneva, Switzerland.\n The meeting’s primary objective was to provide guidance on clinical endpoints and development pathways for vaccine trials with a focus on considerations of low- and middle-income countries.\n Meeting participants reached consensus on candidate case definitions for RSV disease, considerations for clinical efficacy endpoints, and the clinical development pathway for active and passive immunization trials in maternal and pediatric populations.\n The strategic focus of this meeting was on the development of high quality, safe and efficacious RSV preventive interventions for global use and included: (1) maternal/passive immunization to prevent RSV disease in infants less than 6 months; (2) pediatric immunization to prevent RSV disease in infants and young children once protection afforded by maternal immunization

acute lower respiratory infections in young children in 2010: a systematic analysis","abstract":"Background\nThe annual number of hospital admissions and in-hospital deaths due to severe acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI) in young children worldwide is unknown.\n\n We aimed to estimate the incidence of admissions and deaths for such infections in children younger than 5 years in 2010.\nMethods\nWe estimated the incidence of admissions for severe and very severe ALRI in children younger than 5 years, stratified by age and region, with data from a systematic review of studies published between Jan 1, 1990, and March 31, 2012, and from 28 unpublished population-based studies.\n\n We applied these incidence estimates to population estimates for 2010, to calculate the global and regional burden in children admitted with severe ALRI in that year.\n\n We estimated in-hospital mortality due to severe and very severe ALRI by combining incidence estimates with case fatality ratios from hospital-based studies.\n\n\nFindings\nWe identified 89 eligible studies and estimated that in 2010, 11·9 million (95% CI 10·3–13·9 million) episodes of severe and 3·0 million (2·1–4·2 million) episodes of very severe ALRI resulted in hospital admissions in young children worldwide.\n\n Incidence was higher in boys than in girls, the sex disparity being greatest in South Asian studies.\n\n On the basis of data from 37 hospital studies reporting case fatality ratios for severe ALRI, we estimated that roughly 265?000 (95% CI 160?000–450?000) in-hospital deaths took place in young children, with 99% of these deaths in developing countries.\n\n Therefore, the data suggest that although 62% of children with severe ALRI are treated in hospitals, 81% of deaths happen outside hospitals.\n\n\nInterpretation\nSevere ALRI is a substantial burden on health services worldwide and a major cause of hospital referral and admission in young children.\n\n Improved hospital access and reduced inequities, such as those related to sex and rural status, could substantially decrease mortality related to such infection.\n\n Community-based management of severe disease could be an important complementary strategy to reduce pneumonia mortality and health inequities.\n\n\nFunding\nWHO.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3986472","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Lancet Publishing

Bronchiolitis Hospitalization Rates in High-Risk Infants in a United States Nationally Representative Database, 1997–2012","abstract":"Background\nRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes significant pediatric morbidity and is the most common cause of bronchiolitis.\n\n Bronchiolitis hospitalizations declined among US infants from 2000?2009; however, rates in infants at high risk for RSV have not been described.\n\n This study examined RSV and unspecified bronchiolitis (UB) hospitalization rates from 1997?2012 among US high-risk infants.\n\n\nMethods\nThe Kids’ Inpatient Database (KID) infant annual RSV (ICD-9 079.6, 466.11, 480.1) and UB (ICD-9 466.19, 466.1) hospitalization rates were estimated using weighted counts.\n\n Denominators were based on birth hospitalizations with conditions associated with high-risk for RSV: chronic perinatal respiratory disease (chronic lung disease [CLD]); congenital airway anomalies (CAA); congenital heart disease (CHD); Down syndrome (DS); and other genetic, metabolic, musculoskeletal, and immunodeficiency conditions.\n\n Preterm infants could not be identified.\n\n Hospitalizations were characterized by mechanical ventilation, inpatient mortality, length of stay, and total cost (2015$).\n\n Poisson and linear regression were used to test statistical significance of trends.\n\n\nResults\nRSV and UB hospitalization rates were substantially elevated for infants with higher-risk CHD, CLD, CAA and DS without CHD compared with all infants.\n\n RSV rates declined by 47.0% in CLD and 49.7% in higher-risk CHD infants; no other declines in high-risk groups were observed.\n\n UB rates increased in all high-risk groups except for a 22.5% decrease among higher-risk CHD.\n\n Among high-risk infants, mechanical ventilation increased through 2012 to 20.4% and 13.5% of RSV and UB hospitalizations; geometric mean cost increased to $31,742 and $25,962, respectively, and RSV mortality declined to 0.9%.\n\n\nConclusions\nAmong high-risk infants between 1997 and 2012, RSV hospitalization rates declined among CLD and higher-risk CHD infants, coincident with widespread RSV immunoprophylaxis use in

Akershus, Norway, 1993–2000: a population-based retrospective study","abstract":"Background\nRSV is recognized as the most important cause of serious lower respiratory tract illness in infants and young children worldwide leading to hospitalisation in a great number of cases, especially in certain high-risk groups.\n\n The aims of the present study were to identify risk groups, outcome and incidences of hospitalisation for RSV bronchiolitis in Norwegian children under two years of age and to compare the results with other studies.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed a population-based retrospective survey for the period 1993–2000 in children under two years of age hospitalised for RSV bronchiolitis.\n\n\nResults\n822 admissions from 764 patients were identified, 93% had one hospitalisation, while 7% had two or more hospitalisations.\n\n Mean annual hospitalisation incidences were 21.7 per 1.000 children under one year of age, 6.8 per 1.000 children at 1–2 years of age and 14.1 per 1.000 children under two years of age.\n\n 77 children (85 admissions) belonged to one or more high-risk groups such as preterm birth, trisomy 21 and congenital heart disease.\n\n For preterm children under one year of age, at 1–2 years of age and under two years of age hospitalisation incidences per 1.000 children were 23.5, 8.7 and 16.2 respectively.\n\n The incidence for children under two years of age with trisomy 21 was 153.8 per 1.000 children.\n\n\nConclusion\nWhile the overall hospitalisation incidences and outcome of RSV bronchiolitis were in agreement with other studies, hospitalisation incidences for preterm children were lower than in many other studies.\n\n Age on admission for preterm children, when corrected for prematurity, was comparable to low-risk children.\n\n Length of hospitalisation and morbidity was high in both preterm children, children with a congenital heart disease and in children with trisomy 21, the last group being at particular high risk for severe disease.\n\n\n","id":"PMC544884","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed
