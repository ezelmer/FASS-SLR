The virus is considered to be transmitted by respiratory droplets and contact. 1 ,  2  By 8 February 2020, 37 251 cases with COVID-19 infection have been confirmed in China, according to the data reported by the National Health Commission of China, with a wild spread to other 24 countries, such as Japan, Singapore, Thailand, North Korea, and so on. 3  \nIn the early days of a COVID-19 infection outbreak, pediatric patients were rather rare, who were thought to be not susceptible to it. However, along with the emerging of familial aggregation, children suffered from COVID-19 infection were gradually appeared. Also, neonates who born to mothers with COVID-19 infection were in concern. As a pediatric group is usually susceptible to upper respiratory tract infection, because of their developing immune system, the delayed presence of pediatric patients is confusing. Otherwise, under the circumference of wildly spread of COVID-19 and low detection rate by pharyngeal swab COVID-19 nucleic acid test, how to distinguish it from other common respiratory tract infection pathogens in pediatric patients is still a problem. Whether it shares the same imaging pattern of adults is also an important issue.\nAs the clinical and imaging features of pediatric patients with COVID-19 infection were limited, we would like to present a series of 20 cases who have been identified by the pharyngeal swab COVID-19 nucleic acid test.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nSubjects\nTwenty pediatric inpatients with COVID-19 infection confirmed by pharyngeal swab COVID-19 nucleic acid test from 23 January to 8 February in Wuhan Children's Hospital were included in this study. All the patients are in accordance to the &quot;Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for COVID-19 (Fifth Revised Edition)&quot; distributed by the National Health Commission. 4  \nData collection\nClinical charts data including demography information, contact history, previous history, clinical symptoms, laboratory findings, and coinfection which defined as a concurrent infection of a patient with two or more pathogens simultaneously. The hospital stays were updated to 18 February 2020.\nThe chest computed tomography (CTs) were obtained from all subjects, as the plain chest X-ray cannot exclude the existence of pulmonary lesions, especially for the patients without symptoms and mild cases. For all the patients, noncontrast chest CT studies were performed on SOMATOM Definiton AS 128 unit (Siemens medical system; Siemens, Germany) with the following parameters: 12 0 kV, 100 to 150 mA, 0.6-mm collimation, and 1:1 pitch. The scanning range covered from lung apex to diaphragm on axial plane taken under free breathing with the patients in the supine position. Thin-section CT images were reconstructed with 1.25-mm collimation with a standard algorithm and then sent to the picture archiving and communication system (PACS) for analyzing. CT images were evaluated using a lung window with a window level of -600 HU and window width of 1500 HU, and the soft-tissue window with a window level of 40 HU and window width of 300 HU. If necessary, 0.50 mL/kg body mass of 10% chloral hydrate was taken orally before the examination. All the images were stored in PACS and reviewed by two experienced pediatric radiologists. The CT features were evaluated as follows: (a) ground-glass opacities, (b) consolidations with surrounding halo sign, (c) nodules, (d) fine mesh shadow, (e) pleural effusion, (f) lymphadenopathy, (g) unilateral or bilateral, (h) subpleural or nonsubpleural, and (i) residual fiber strips.\nPharyngeal swab samples of all the subjects in this group were collected, and the COVID-19 RNA was identified by a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.\nThe protocol for this retrospective study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Wuhan Children's Hospital and the written informed consent was waived for emerging infectious diseases.\nRESULTS\nThe clinical features of pediatric patients with COVID-19 infection were displayed in Table 1. In this study, 13 patients were male (13/20, 65%) and 7 were female (7/20, 35%). Patient ages ranged from 1 day to 14 years 7 months, with a median age of 2 years and 1.5 months. Thirteen pediatric patients (13/20, 65%) had an identified history of close contact with COVID-19 diagnosed family members. The clinical manifestations included fever which defined as axillary temperature over 37.3 C in 12 cases (12/20, 60%), cough in 13 cases (13/20, 65%), diarrhea in 3 cases (3/20, 15%), nasal discharge in 3 cases (3/20, 15%), sore throat in 1 case (1/20, 5%), vomiting in 2 cases (2/20, 10%), tachypnea in 2 cases (2/20, 10%), and fatigue in 1 case (1/20, 5%). Most of the children did not have positive pulmonary signs, moist rales were found in three cases (3/20, 15%), retraction signs were found in one case (1/20, 5%), and cyanosis was found in one case (1/20, 5%).\nSummary of patient characteristics (n = 20)\nCharacteristic	Number (%)	 	Sex		 	Boy	13 (65%)	 	Girl	7 (35%)	 	Age		 	&lt;1 mo	3 (15%)	 	1 mo to 1 y	6 (30%)	 	1-3 y	5 (25%)	 	3-6 y	3 (15%)	 	&gt;6 y	3 (15%)	 	Contact history		 	Yes	13 (65%)	 	Uncertainty	7 (35%)	 	Symptom		 	Fever	12 (60%)	 	Cough	13 (65%)	 	Diarrhea	3 (15%)	 	Nasal discharge	3 (15%)	 	Sore throat	1 (5%)	 	Fatigue	1 (5%)	 	Vomiting	2 (10%)	 	Tachypnea	2 (10%)	 	Other findings		 	Sinus tachycardia	1 (5%)	 	Epilepsy as a sequela of previous viral encephalitis	1 (5%)	 	History of atrial septal defect surgery	2 (10%)	 	Atrial arrhythmia	1 (5%)	 	First-degree atrioventricular block, atrial and ventricular premature beat	1 (5%)	 	Incomplete right bundle-branch block	1 (5%)	 	\nThis article is being made freely available through PubMed Central as part of the COVID-19 public health emergency response.

White blood cell count was normal in 14 cases (14/20, 70%), decreased in 4 cases (4/20, 20%), and increased in 2 cases (2/20, 10%); percentage of lymphocyte decreased in 7 cases (7/20, 35%) and increased in 3 cases (3/20, 15%); alanine aminotransferase increased in 5 cases (5/20, 25%); creatine kinase-MB increased in 15 cases (15/20, 75%); C-reactive protein (CRP) increased in 9 cases (9/20, 45%); and procalcitonin (PCT) increased in 16 cases (16/20, 80%). Eight patients were coinfected with other pathogens (8/20, 40%), including influenza viruses A and B, mycoplasma, respiratory syncytial virus, and cytomegalovirus. Furthermore, four cases had abnormal electrocardiogram events. Two patients have a history of atrial septal defect surgery and one with epilepsy as a sequela of previous viral encephalitis.\nLaboratory information of pediatric patients with COVID-19 infection\nParameter	Number of patients (%)	 	WBC, x109/L		 	&lt;5.50	4 (20%)	 	5.50-12.20	14 (70%)	 	&gt;12.20	2 (10%)	 	L%		 	&lt;45	7 (35%)	 	45-65	10 (50%)	 	&gt;65	3 (15%)	 	CRP, mg/L		 	&lt;=3	13 (65%)	 	&gt;3	7 (35%)	 	PCT, mg/L		 	&lt;=0.05	4 (20%)	 	&gt;0.05	16 (80%)	 	ALT, IU/L		 	&lt;=40	15 (75%)	 	&gt;40	5 (25%)	 	CK-MB, IU/L		 	&lt;=25	15 (75%)	 	&gt;25	5 (25%)	 	Coinfection pathogen		 	Cytomegalovirus	1 (5%)	 	Influenza B virus	2 (10%)	 	Influenza A virus	1 (5%)	 	Mycoplasma	4 (20%)	 	Respiratory syncytial virus	1 (5%)	 	\nAbbreviations: ALT, alanine aminotransferase; CK-MB, creatine kinase-MB; CRP, C-reactive protein; L%, percentage of lymphocyte; PCT, procalcitonin; WBC, white blood cell.\nThis article is being made freely available through PubMed Central as part of the COVID-19 public health emergency response.

As most of the pediatric patients were not severe, plain chest X-ray could not identify all the pulmonary lesions, chest CTs were obtained to provide support information for diagnosis and management.\nAccording to the &quot;Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for COVID-19 (Fifth Revised Edition),&quot; 4  the imaging manifestations of chest CTs obtained in this study were divided into four stages, as follows:\nEarly stage: 6 patients presented with unilateral pulmonary lesions (6/20, 30%), 10 presented with bilateral pulmonary lesions (10/20, 50%), and 3 neonates and 1 child showed no abnormality on chest CT (4/20, 20%). Subpleural lesions with localized inflammatory infiltration were found in all children (Figure 1A). Consolidation with surrounding halo sign was observed in 10 patients (10/20, 50%), ground-glass opacities were observed in 12 patients (12/20, 60%), fine mesh shadow was observed in 4 patients (4/20, 20%), and tiny nodules were observed in 3 patients (3/20, 15%) (Table 3). Chest CT showed no signs of pleural effusion and lymphadenopathy.\nA, Female, 14 years old. Chest CT showed scattered ground-glass opacities in the inferior lobe of the right lung, located subpleural or extended from subpleural lesions. B, Male, 10 years old. Chest CT showed consolidation with halo sign in the inferior lobe of the left lung surrounded by ground-glass opacities. C, Male, 1 year old. Chest CT showed diffused consolidations and ground-glass opacities in both lungs, with a &quot;white lung&quot; appearance of the right lung.

Ground-glass opacities and consolidation coexist and may be accompanied by interlobular septal thickening, fibrosis lesions, or air bronchogram signs (Figure 1B).\nCritical stage: In the case of further development of the lesion, the chest CT showed that the consolidation lesions were diffuse and involved both lungs, presenting as a &quot;white lung&quot; change, accompanied by air bronchogram sign. The lesion density was heterogeneous, accompanied by ground-glass opacities and pleural thickening (Figure 1C).\nRecovery stage: After treatment, a chest CT follow-up was obtained in six cases. Lesions were completely absorbed in two cases (2/20, 10%) (Figures 2A and 2D), consolidations turned into ground-glass opacities and gradually decreased in three cases (3/20, 15%) (Figures 2B and 2E), and residual fiber strip remained in three cases (3/20, 15%) (Figures 2C and 2F).\nA, Male, 3 years old. On admission, chest CT showed consolidation in the posterior segment of the upper lobe of the left lung with a surrounded halo sign. B, Female, 8 years old. On admission, chest CT showed patchy consolidation with halo sign in the basal segment of the inferior lobe of the right lung, and ground-glass opacities in the inferior lobe of the left lung. C, Male, 14 years old. On admission, chest CT showed consolidation with halo sign in the lingular segment of the left lung, and fibrous cords in both lungs. D, The same patient of (A), 11 days after admission, chest CT showed that the consolidation in the posterior segment of the upper lobe of the left lung was disappeared. E, The same patient of (B), 4 days after admission, chest CT showed shrunken lesions with lower density in the inferior lobes of both lungs. F, The same patient of (C), 3 days after admission, chest CT showed a contraction of consolidation in lingular segment of the left lung, the disappearance of halo sign, and fibrous cords left in both lungs. CT, computed tomography\nAll the patients had been treated in the isolation ward of Wuhan Children's Hospital. Eighteen patients were cured and discharged with an average stay of 12.9 days (8-20 days). Two asymptomatic neonates were still under observation because of positive results from the pharyngeal swab COVID-19 nucleic acid test, with negative CT findings.\nDISCUSSION\nCOVID-19 viral pneumonia is an acute infectious respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus. By the beginning of February 2020, nearly 30 000 cases had been confirmed nationwide, while the actual number would be larger. 5  The virus can be transmitted by an infected person or an asymptomatic carrier and is a highly contagious disease. Respiratory droplets are the main route of transmission, but can also be transmitted by contact and digestive tract. 6  The incubation period is about 1 to 14 days, and is supposed could be up to 24 days. Crowds are generally susceptible to COVID-19. Most of the cases are mild, but the elderly or those with underlying diseases are more likely to develop to severe stage. 7  The lack of children samples in the previously reported studies may be related to the children staying at home during the Spring Festival holiday and having less contact with the source of infection.\nThe clinical manifestations of children patients are similar to those of adults, such as fever and cough. A few children have diarrhea and runny nose, but the overall symptoms are relatively mild. Thirteen pediatric patients, including three neonates, had an identified history of close contact with COVID-19 diagnosed family members, who were undergone the COVID-19 RNA detection. Although the results in three neonates were positive, no lesion was found on chest CT, repeated COVID-19 RNA detection should be carried out for excluding the possibility of a contaminated sample and other reasons. As no evidence of vertical transmission has been confirmed in the previous study, 8  close contacts may be the possible explanation for the positive result in our study. Remarkably, 7 of 20 patients had a previous history of congenital or acquired diseases, which may indicate that children with underlying diseases may be more susceptible to COVID-19 infection. Overall, pediatric patients generally have a good prognosis with an average hospital stay of 12.9 days.\nPCT is a marker for bacterial infection which could be induced by bacteriotoxin but suppressed by interferon. 9  It is worth noting that the PCT was elevated in 80% cases in this study, no matter coinfection evidence existed or not, which is not common in adult patients. It may suggest that routine antibacterial treatment should be considered in pediatric patients, as the coinfection was common in our cases (40%).\nIn most cases of this study, abnormal laboratory results may prompt clinicians to further screen the nucleic acid detection of COVID-19 virus. In a clinical setting, pharyngeal swab COVID-19 virus nucleic acid detection is an important basis for diagnosis. However, due to the limitation of sampling materials, especially in the early stage of the disease, the positive rate is relatively low. Therefore, early diagnosis is of great significance for further rational management and clinical treatment of children. Moreover, since most of the pediatric patients are mild cases, plain chest X-ray often fails to show the lesions or the detailed features, leading to misdiagnosis or missed diagnosis. Therefore, early chest CT examination is very necessary. In some pediatric patients with a negative nucleic acid of COVID-19 virus, we managed them as suspected patients according to the typical lesions shown on chest CT, which could provide evidence not only for early treatment to the children but also for effectively isolating the source of infection.\nChest CT findings in children were similar to those in adults, and most of them were mild cases. 10 ,  11  The typical manifestations were unilateral or bilateral subpleural ground-glass opacities, and consolidations with surrounding halo sign. As consolidations with surrounding halo sign account for up to 50% cases, they should be considered as typical signs in pediatric patients. Pleural effusion was not seen. The absorption of lesions on chest CT lagged behind clinical symptoms and nucleic acid detection. Lesions could be still visible on chest CT when two consecutive nucleic acid tests were negative. As for the normal findings in three neonates with a positive nucleic acid test, whether it was due to the influence of the delivery process on sampling or the specific CT manifestations for neonates, more samples are needed for further confirmation.\nThe CT imaging of COVID-19 infection should be differentiated with other virus pneumonias, such as influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and adenovirus. 12  Adenovirus pneumonia lesions had higher density, more consolidations, and fewer subpleural lesions. Respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza virus pneumonia lesions were mostly distributed along the bronchial tree with a thickened bronchial wall. Influenza viruses could cause grid-like changes in the lungs. In addition, it should be differentiated from bacterial pneumonia, mycoplasma pneumonia, and chlamydia pneumonia, and the density of pneumonia lesions caused by the latter pathogens is relatively higher. However, chest CT manifestations of pneumonia caused by different pathogens overlap, and COVID-19 pneumonia can be superimposed with pneumonia caused by other types of pathogens, presenting more serious and complex imaging manifestations, so epidemiological and etiological examination should be combined.\nIn conclusion, COVID-19 virus pneumonia in children is mainly mild, and chest CT can present characteristic changes of subpleural ground-glass opacities and consolidations with surrounding halo, which is an effective means for follow up and evaluating the changes of lung lesions. In the case that the positive rate of COVID-19 nucleic acid test from pharyngeal swab samples is not high, the early detection of lesions by CT is conducive to reasonable management and early treatment for pediatric patients. However, the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia by CT imaging alone is not sufficient enough, especially in the case of coinfection with other pathogens. Therefore, early chest CT screening and timely follow-up, combined with corresponding pathogen detection, is a feasible clinical protocol in children.\nCONFLICT OF INTERESTS\nThe authors declare that there are no conflict of interests.\nREFERENCES\nClinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China\nA novel coronavirus from patients with pneumonia in China, 2019\nNovel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) early-stage importation risk to Europe, January 2020\nGeneral Office of the National Health Commission of China.

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome

Coronavirus–Infected Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nThe initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7121484","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile

Viral replication and cytopathic effect induce hiPSC-CM apoptosis and cessation of beating after 72 h of infection.\n SARS-CoV-2 infection activates innate immune response and antiviral clearance gene pathways, while inhibiting metabolic pathways and suppressing ACE2 expression.\n These studies show that SARS-CoV-2 can infect hiPSC-CMs in vitro, establishing a model for elucidating infection mechanisms and potentially a cardiac-specific antiviral drug screening platform.\n","id":"PMC7323681","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier","authors":[{"firstname":"Arun","surname":"Sharma","email":"arun.sharma@cshs.org","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gustavo","surname":"Garcia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yizhou","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jasmine T.","surname":"Plummer","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kouki","surname":"Morizono","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Vaithilingaraja","surname":"Arumugaswami","email":"varumugaswami@mednet.ucla.edu","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Clive N.","surname":"Svendsen","email":"clive.svendsen@cshs.org","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.ajem.2020.04.048","date":"2020-04-14","title":"Cardiovascular complications in COVID-19","abstract":"Background\nThe coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).\n\n While systemic inflammation and pulmonary complications can result in significant morbidity and mortality, cardiovascular complications may also occur.\n\n\nObjective\nThis brief report evaluates cardiovascular complications in the setting of COVID-19 infection.\n\n\nDiscussion\nThe current COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in over one million infected worldwide and thousands of death.\n\n The virus binds and enters through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).\n\n COVID-19 can result in systemic inflammation, multiorgan dysfunction, and critical illness.\n\n The cardiovascular system is also affected, with complications including myocardial injury, myocarditis, acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, dysrhythmias, and venous thromboembolic events.\n\n Current therapies for COVID-19 may interact with cardiovascular medications.\n\n\nConclusions\nEmergency clinicians should be aware of these cardiovascular complications when evaluating and managing the patient with COVID-19.\n","id":"PMC7165109","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"W B Saunders","authors":[{"firstname":"Brit","surname":"Long","email":"brit.long@yahoo.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"William J.","surname":"Brady","email":"WB4Z@hscmail.mcc.virginia.edu","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Alex","surname":"Koyfman","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Michael","surname":"Gottlieb","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1136/heartjnl-2020-317186","date":"1970-01-01","title":"COVID-19 pandemic and troponin: indirect myocardial injury, myocardial inflammation or myocarditis?","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30937-5","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Endothelial cell infection and endotheliitis in COVID-19","abstract":"","id":"PMC7172722","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Zsuzsanna","surname":"Varga","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Andreas J","surname":"Flammer","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peter","surname":"Steiger","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Martina","surname":"Haberecker","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rea","surname":"Andermatt","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Annelies S","surname":"Zinkernagel","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mandeep R","surname":"Mehra","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Reto A","surname":"Schuepbach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Frank","surname":"Ruschitzka","email":"frank.ruschitzka@usz.ch","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Holger","surname":"Moch","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) early-stage importation risk to Europe, January 2020","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"World Health Organization (WHO).

diagnosis of pediatric pneumonia in primary health care can reduce the chance of long-term respiratory diseases, related hospitalizations and mortality while lowering medical costs.\n\n The aim of this study was to assess the value of blood biomarkers, clinical symptoms and their combination in assisting discrimination of pneumonia from upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) in children.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>Both univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were used to build the pneumonia screening model based on a retrospective cohort, comprised of 5211 children (age???18?years).\n\n The electronic health records of the patients, who had inpatient admission or outpatient visits between February 15, 2012 to September 30, 2018, were extracted from the hospital information system of Zhejiang Provincial People’s Hospital, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.\n\n The children who were diagnosed with pneumonia and URTI were enrolled and their clinical features and levels of blood biomarkers were compared.\n\n Using the area under the ROC curve, both two screening models were evaluated under 80% (training) versus 20% (test) cross-validation data split for their accuracy.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>In the retrospective cohort, 2548 of 5211 children were diagnosed with the defined pneumonia.\n\n The univariate screening model reached predicted AUCs of 0.76 for lymphocyte/monocyte ratio (LMR) and 0.71 for neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) when identified overall pneumonia from URTI, attaining the best performance among the biomarker candidates.\n\n In subgroup analysis, LMR and NLR attained AUCs of 0.80 and 0.86 to differentiate viral pneumonia from URTI, and AUCs of 0.77 and 0.71 to discriminate bacterial pneumonia from URTI respectively.\n\n After integrating LMR and NLR with three clinical symptoms of fever, cough and rhinorrhea, the multivariate screening model obtained increased predictive values, reaching validated AUCs of 0.84, 0.95 and 0.86 for distinguishing pneumonia, viral pneumonia and bacterial pneumonia from URTI respectively.\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par4'>Our study demonstrated that combining LMR and NLR with critical clinical characteristics reached promising accuracy in differentiating pneumonia from URTI, thus could be considered as a useful screening tool to assist the diagnosis of pneumonia, in particular, in community healthcare centers.\n\n Further researches could be conducted to evaluate the model’s clinical utility and cost-effectiveness in primary care scenarios to facilitate pneumonia diagnosis,

According to the survival status after 28 days of treatment, all children were divided into the survival group (n?=?59) and the death group (n?=?32).\n\n The clinical data and laboratory indicators of the patients were recorded.\n\n Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze the risk factors of prognosis, and the ROC curve was used to analyze the predictive value of each index.\n\n \nResults\n The Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score and CURB-65 score of the death group were higher than those of the survival group (P &lt; 0.05).\n\n The RDW, NLR, PLR, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, procalcitonin blood lactic acid (Lac) of the death group, were higher than those of the survival group, and LYM was lower than the survival group (P &lt; 0.05).\n\n Multivariate regression analysis showed that APACHE II score, RDW, NLR, PLR, and Lac were all independent risk factors for poor prognosis in children with SP (P &lt; 0.05).\n\n The AUC of NLR, PLR, and RDW for evaluating the prognosis of children with SP were 0.798, 0.781, and 0.777, respectively.\n\n The sensitivity was 56.25%, 90.63%, and 56.25%, respectively, and the specificity was 89.83%, 55.93%, and 91.53%, respectively.\n\n The AUC of NLR, PLR, and RDW combined to evaluate the prognosis of children with SP was 0.943.

of US in comparison with CR were respectively 97.9%, 94.5%, 94.0% and 98.1%.\n\n US identified a significantly higher number of cases of pleural effusion, but the concordance of the two methods in identifying the type of CAP was poor.\n\n\nConclusion\nUS can be considered a useful means of diagnosing CAP in children admitted to an Emergency Department with a lower respiratory tract infection, although its usefulness in identifying the type of lung involvement requires further evaluation.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4012508","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

The virus is considered to be transmitted by respiratory droplets and contact. 1 ,  2  By 8 February 2020, 37 251 cases with COVID-19 infection have been confirmed in China, according to the data reported by the National Health Commission of China, with a wild spread to other 24 countries, such as Japan, Singapore, Thailand, North Korea, and so on. 3  \nIn the early days of a COVID-19 infection outbreak, pediatric patients were rather rare, who were thought to be not susceptible to it. However, along with the emerging of familial aggregation, children suffered from COVID-19 infection were gradually appeared. Also, neonates who born to mothers with COVID-19 infection were in concern. As a pediatric group is usually susceptible to upper respiratory tract infection, because of their developing immune system, the delayed presence of pediatric patients is confusing. Otherwise, under the circumference of wildly spread of COVID-19 and low detection rate by pharyngeal swab COVID-19 nucleic acid test, how to distinguish it from other common respiratory tract infection pathogens in pediatric patients is still a problem. Whether it shares the same imaging pattern of adults is also an important issue.\nAs the clinical and imaging features of pediatric patients with COVID-19 infection were limited, we would like to present a series of 20 cases who have been identified by the pharyngeal swab COVID-19 nucleic acid test.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nSubjects\nTwenty pediatric inpatients with COVID-19 infection confirmed by pharyngeal swab COVID-19 nucleic acid test from 23 January to 8 February in Wuhan Children's Hospital were included in this study. All the patients are in accordance to the &quot;Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for COVID-19 (Fifth Revised Edition)&quot; distributed by the National Health Commission. 4  \nData collection\nClinical charts data including demography information, contact history, previous history, clinical symptoms, laboratory findings, and coinfection which defined as a concurrent infection of a patient with two or more pathogens simultaneously. The hospital stays were updated to 18 February 2020.\nThe chest computed tomography (CTs) were obtained from all subjects, as the plain chest X-ray cannot exclude the existence of pulmonary lesions, especially for the patients without symptoms and mild cases. For all the patients, noncontrast chest CT studies were performed on SOMATOM Definiton AS 128 unit (Siemens medical system; Siemens, Germany) with the following parameters: 12 0 kV, 100 to 150 mA, 0.6-mm collimation, and 1:1 pitch. The scanning range covered from lung apex to diaphragm on axial plane taken under free breathing with the patients in the supine position. Thin-section CT images were reconstructed with 1.25-mm collimation with a standard algorithm and then sent to the picture archiving and communication system (PACS) for analyzing. CT images were evaluated using a lung window with a window level of -600 HU and window width of 1500 HU, and the soft-tissue window with a window level of 40 HU and window width of 300 HU. If necessary, 0.50 mL/kg body mass of 10% chloral hydrate was taken orally before the examination. All the images were stored in PACS and reviewed by two experienced pediatric radiologists. The CT features were evaluated as follows: (a) ground-glass opacities, (b) consolidations with surrounding halo sign, (c) nodules, (d) fine mesh shadow, (e) pleural effusion, (f) lymphadenopathy, (g) unilateral or bilateral, (h) subpleural or nonsubpleural, and (i) residual fiber strips.\nPharyngeal swab samples of all the subjects in this group were collected, and the COVID-19 RNA was identified by a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.\nThe protocol for this retrospective study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Wuhan Children's Hospital and the written informed consent was waived for emerging infectious diseases.\nRESULTS\nThe clinical features of pediatric patients with COVID-19 infection were displayed in Table 1. In this study, 13 patients were male (13/20, 65%) and 7 were female (7/20, 35%). Patient ages ranged from 1 day to 14 years 7 months, with a median age of 2 years and 1.5 months. Thirteen pediatric patients (13/20, 65%) had an identified history of close contact with COVID-19 diagnosed family members. The clinical manifestations included fever which defined as axillary temperature over 37.3 C in 12 cases (12/20, 60%), cough in 13 cases (13/20, 65%), diarrhea in 3 cases (3/20, 15%), nasal discharge in 3 cases (3/20, 15%), sore throat in 1 case (1/20, 5%), vomiting in 2 cases (2/20, 10%), tachypnea in 2 cases (2/20, 10%), and fatigue in 1 case (1/20, 5%). Most of the children did not have positive pulmonary signs, moist rales were found in three cases (3/20, 15%), retraction signs were found in one case (1/20, 5%), and cyanosis was found in one case (1/20, 5%).\nSummary of patient characteristics (n = 20)\nCharacteristic	Number (%)	 	Sex		 	Boy	13 (65%)	 	Girl	7 (35%)	 	Age		 	&lt;1 mo	3 (15%)	 	1 mo to 1 y	6 (30%)	 	1-3 y	5 (25%)	 	3-6 y	3 (15%)	 	&gt;6 y	3 (15%)	 	Contact history		 	Yes	13 (65%)	 	Uncertainty	7 (35%)	 	Symptom		 	Fever	12 (60%)	 	Cough	13 (65%)	 	Diarrhea	3 (15%)	 	Nasal discharge	3 (15%)	 	Sore throat	1 (5%)	 	Fatigue	1 (5%)	 	Vomiting	2 (10%)	 	Tachypnea	2 (10%)	 	Other findings		 	Sinus tachycardia	1 (5%)	 	Epilepsy as a sequela of previous viral encephalitis	1 (5%)	 	History of atrial septal defect surgery	2 (10%)	 	Atrial arrhythmia	1 (5%)	 	First-degree atrioventricular block, atrial and ventricular premature beat	1 (5%)	 	Incomplete right bundle-branch block	1 (5%)	 	\nThis article is being made freely available through PubMed Central as part of the COVID-19 public health emergency response.

As most of the pediatric patients were not severe, plain chest X-ray could not identify all the pulmonary lesions, chest CTs were obtained to provide support information for diagnosis and management.\nAccording to the &quot;Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for COVID-19 (Fifth Revised Edition),&quot; 4  the imaging manifestations of chest CTs obtained in this study were divided into four stages, as follows:\nEarly stage: 6 patients presented with unilateral pulmonary lesions (6/20, 30%), 10 presented with bilateral pulmonary lesions (10/20, 50%), and 3 neonates and 1 child showed no abnormality on chest CT (4/20, 20%). Subpleural lesions with localized inflammatory infiltration were found in all children (Figure 1A). Consolidation with surrounding halo sign was observed in 10 patients (10/20, 50%), ground-glass opacities were observed in 12 patients (12/20, 60%), fine mesh shadow was observed in 4 patients (4/20, 20%), and tiny nodules were observed in 3 patients (3/20, 15%) (Table 3). Chest CT showed no signs of pleural effusion and lymphadenopathy.\nA, Female, 14 years old. Chest CT showed scattered ground-glass opacities in the inferior lobe of the right lung, located subpleural or extended from subpleural lesions. B, Male, 10 years old. Chest CT showed consolidation with halo sign in the inferior lobe of the left lung surrounded by ground-glass opacities. C, Male, 1 year old. Chest CT showed diffused consolidations and ground-glass opacities in both lungs, with a &quot;white lung&quot; appearance of the right lung.

Ground-glass opacities and consolidation coexist and may be accompanied by interlobular septal thickening, fibrosis lesions, or air bronchogram signs (Figure 1B).\nCritical stage: In the case of further development of the lesion, the chest CT showed that the consolidation lesions were diffuse and involved both lungs, presenting as a &quot;white lung&quot; change, accompanied by air bronchogram sign. The lesion density was heterogeneous, accompanied by ground-glass opacities and pleural thickening (Figure 1C).\nRecovery stage: After treatment, a chest CT follow-up was obtained in six cases. Lesions were completely absorbed in two cases (2/20, 10%) (Figures 2A and 2D), consolidations turned into ground-glass opacities and gradually decreased in three cases (3/20, 15%) (Figures 2B and 2E), and residual fiber strip remained in three cases (3/20, 15%) (Figures 2C and 2F).\nA, Male, 3 years old. On admission, chest CT showed consolidation in the posterior segment of the upper lobe of the left lung with a surrounded halo sign. B, Female, 8 years old. On admission, chest CT showed patchy consolidation with halo sign in the basal segment of the inferior lobe of the right lung, and ground-glass opacities in the inferior lobe of the left lung. C, Male, 14 years old. On admission, chest CT showed consolidation with halo sign in the lingular segment of the left lung, and fibrous cords in both lungs. D, The same patient of (A), 11 days after admission, chest CT showed that the consolidation in the posterior segment of the upper lobe of the left lung was disappeared. E, The same patient of (B), 4 days after admission, chest CT showed shrunken lesions with lower density in the inferior lobes of both lungs. F, The same patient of (C), 3 days after admission, chest CT showed a contraction of consolidation in lingular segment of the left lung, the disappearance of halo sign, and fibrous cords left in both lungs. CT, computed tomography\nAll the patients had been treated in the isolation ward of Wuhan Children's Hospital. Eighteen patients were cured and discharged with an average stay of 12.9 days (8-20 days). Two asymptomatic neonates were still under observation because of positive results from the pharyngeal swab COVID-19 nucleic acid test, with negative CT findings.\nDISCUSSION\nCOVID-19 viral pneumonia is an acute infectious respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus. By the beginning of February 2020, nearly 30 000 cases had been confirmed nationwide, while the actual number would be larger. 5  The virus can be transmitted by an infected person or an asymptomatic carrier and is a highly contagious disease. Respiratory droplets are the main route of transmission, but can also be transmitted by contact and digestive tract. 6  The incubation period is about 1 to 14 days, and is supposed could be up to 24 days. Crowds are generally susceptible to COVID-19. Most of the cases are mild, but the elderly or those with underlying diseases are more likely to develop to severe stage. 7  The lack of children samples in the previously reported studies may be related to the children staying at home during the Spring Festival holiday and having less contact with the source of infection.\nThe clinical manifestations of children patients are similar to those of adults, such as fever and cough. A few children have diarrhea and runny nose, but the overall symptoms are relatively mild. Thirteen pediatric patients, including three neonates, had an identified history of close contact with COVID-19 diagnosed family members, who were undergone the COVID-19 RNA detection. Although the results in three neonates were positive, no lesion was found on chest CT, repeated COVID-19 RNA detection should be carried out for excluding the possibility of a contaminated sample and other reasons. As no evidence of vertical transmission has been confirmed in the previous study, 8  close contacts may be the possible explanation for the positive result in our study. Remarkably, 7 of 20 patients had a previous history of congenital or acquired diseases, which may indicate that children with underlying diseases may be more susceptible to COVID-19 infection. Overall, pediatric patients generally have a good prognosis with an average hospital stay of 12.9 days.\nPCT is a marker for bacterial infection which could be induced by bacteriotoxin but suppressed by interferon. 9  It is worth noting that the PCT was elevated in 80% cases in this study, no matter coinfection evidence existed or not, which is not common in adult patients. It may suggest that routine antibacterial treatment should be considered in pediatric patients, as the coinfection was common in our cases (40%).\nIn most cases of this study, abnormal laboratory results may prompt clinicians to further screen the nucleic acid detection of COVID-19 virus. In a clinical setting, pharyngeal swab COVID-19 virus nucleic acid detection is an important basis for diagnosis. However, due to the limitation of sampling materials, especially in the early stage of the disease, the positive rate is relatively low. Therefore, early diagnosis is of great significance for further rational management and clinical treatment of children. Moreover, since most of the pediatric patients are mild cases, plain chest X-ray often fails to show the lesions or the detailed features, leading to misdiagnosis or missed diagnosis. Therefore, early chest CT examination is very necessary. In some pediatric patients with a negative nucleic acid of COVID-19 virus, we managed them as suspected patients according to the typical lesions shown on chest CT, which could provide evidence not only for early treatment to the children but also for effectively isolating the source of infection.\nChest CT findings in children were similar to those in adults, and most of them were mild cases. 10 ,  11  The typical manifestations were unilateral or bilateral subpleural ground-glass opacities, and consolidations with surrounding halo sign. As consolidations with surrounding halo sign account for up to 50% cases, they should be considered as typical signs in pediatric patients. Pleural effusion was not seen. The absorption of lesions on chest CT lagged behind clinical symptoms and nucleic acid detection. Lesions could be still visible on chest CT when two consecutive nucleic acid tests were negative. As for the normal findings in three neonates with a positive nucleic acid test, whether it was due to the influence of the delivery process on sampling or the specific CT manifestations for neonates, more samples are needed for further confirmation.\nThe CT imaging of COVID-19 infection should be differentiated with other virus pneumonias, such as influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and adenovirus. 12  Adenovirus pneumonia lesions had higher density, more consolidations, and fewer subpleural lesions. Respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza virus pneumonia lesions were mostly distributed along the bronchial tree with a thickened bronchial wall. Influenza viruses could cause grid-like changes in the lungs. In addition, it should be differentiated from bacterial pneumonia, mycoplasma pneumonia, and chlamydia pneumonia, and the density of pneumonia lesions caused by the latter pathogens is relatively higher. However, chest CT manifestations of pneumonia caused by different pathogens overlap, and COVID-19 pneumonia can be superimposed with pneumonia caused by other types of pathogens, presenting more serious and complex imaging manifestations, so epidemiological and etiological examination should be combined.\nIn conclusion, COVID-19 virus pneumonia in children is mainly mild, and chest CT can present characteristic changes of subpleural ground-glass opacities and consolidations with surrounding halo, which is an effective means for follow up and evaluating the changes of lung lesions. In the case that the positive rate of COVID-19 nucleic acid test from pharyngeal swab samples is not high, the early detection of lesions by CT is conducive to reasonable management and early treatment for pediatric patients. However, the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia by CT imaging alone is not sufficient enough, especially in the case of coinfection with other pathogens. Therefore, early chest CT screening and timely follow-up, combined with corresponding pathogen detection, is a feasible clinical protocol in children.\nCONFLICT OF INTERESTS\nThe authors declare that there are no conflict of interests.\nREFERENCES\nClinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China\nA novel coronavirus from patients with pneumonia in China, 2019\nNovel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) early-stage importation risk to Europe, January 2020\nGeneral Office of the National Health Commission of China.

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.\n\n Increasing quartile of NLR was statistically significantly associated with secondary outcome.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR is associated with outcomes in unselected critically ill patients.\n\n In patients with sepsis, there was no statistically significant relationship between NLR and mortality.\n\n Further investigation is required to increase understanding of the pathophysiology of this relationship and to validate these findings with data collected prospectively.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article

diagnosis of pediatric pneumonia in primary health care can reduce the chance of long-term respiratory diseases, related hospitalizations and mortality while lowering medical costs.\n\n The aim of this study was to assess the value of blood biomarkers, clinical symptoms and their combination in assisting discrimination of pneumonia from upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) in children.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>Both univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were used to build the pneumonia screening model based on a retrospective cohort, comprised of 5211 children (age???18?years).\n\n The electronic health records of the patients, who had inpatient admission or outpatient visits between February 15, 2012 to September 30, 2018, were extracted from the hospital information system of Zhejiang Provincial People’s Hospital, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.\n\n The children who were diagnosed with pneumonia and URTI were enrolled and their clinical features

According to the survival status after 28 days of treatment, all children were divided into the survival group (n?=?59) and the death group (n?=?32).\n\n The clinical data and laboratory indicators of the patients were recorded.\n\n Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze the risk factors of prognosis, and the ROC curve was used to analyze the predictive value of each index.\n\n \nResults\n The Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score and CURB-65 score of the death group were higher than those of the survival group (P &lt; 0.05).\n\n The RDW, NLR, PLR, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, procalcitonin blood lactic acid (Lac) of the death group, were higher than those of the survival group, and LYM was lower than the survival group (P &lt; 0.05).\n\n Multivariate regression analysis showed that APACHE II score, RDW, NLR, PLR, and Lac were all independent risk factors for poor prognosis in children with SP (P &lt; 0.05).\n\n The AUC of NLR, PLR, and RDW for evaluating the prognosis of children with SP were 0.798, 0.781, and 0.777, respectively.\n\n The sensitivity was 56.25%, 90.63%, and 56.25%, respectively, and the specificity was 89.83%, 55.93%, and 91.53%, respectively.\n\n The AUC of NLR, PLR, and RDW combined to evaluate the prognosis of children with SP was 0.943. When the best cut-off value was 0.8528, the sensitivity was 93.75%, and the specificity was 91.53%.\n\n \nConclusion\n NLR, PLR, and RDW have certain predictive value for the prognosis of children

The UK was the first country to authorise a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, with three licensed as of July, 2021: BNT162b2 (tozinameran; Pfizer-BioNTech), mRNA-1273 (elasomeran; Moderna), and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Oxford-AstraZeneca), each with good efficacy in phase 3 clinical trials. Of the 67 1 million adults in the UK, by July 4, 2021, around 45 4 million people had received one vaccine dose and around 33 7 million people had received two doses. UK data present an early insight into the real-world effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines and the remaining challenges post-vaccination.\nA previous analysis of community-based individuals in the COVID Symptom Study showed a significant reduction in infection post-vaccination from 12 days after the first dose, findings that were recapitulated in a UK-based, real-world, case-control study. National surveillance data from the first 4 months of Israel's vaccination campaign showed that two doses of BNT162b2 reduced both symptomatic and asymptomatic infections, COVID-19-related hospitalisations, severe disease, and death.\nNonetheless, some people still contract COVID-19 after vaccination, and further virus variants could evolve with increased transmissibility (as with B.1.1.7 [the alpha variant]). Indeed, variants of concern have shown reduced neutralisation by convalescent and post-vaccination serum samples in vitro, and led to increased rates of post-vaccination infection compared with the original outbreak variant in early findings from a real-world case-control study. Data suggest that although COVID-19 is usually milder if contracted after vaccination than in unvaccinated individuals, mortality remains high in hospitalised individuals: data from the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium have shown a mortality of 27 0% (400 of 1482 died) in individuals hospitalised with COVID-19 in the UK more than 21 days after vaccination, similar to mortality rates observed during the first wave (March-April, 2020).\nResearch in context\n Evidence before this study \nTo identify existing evidence of risk factors for, and the characteristics of, post-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infection, we searched PubMed for peer-reviewed articles published between Dec 1, 2020, and July 4, 2021, using the keywords (&quot;COVID-19&quot; OR &quot;SARS-CoV-2&quot;) AND (&quot;vaccine&quot; OR &quot;vaccination&quot;) AND (&quot;infection&quot;) AND (&quot;risk factor*&quot; OR &quot;characteristic*&quot; OR &quot;symptom*&quot;). We did not restrict our search by language or type of publication. Of the 662 published PubMed articles identified, we found one paper assessing risk factors for post-vaccination infection in fully vaccinated US veterans. This paper suggested that age and the presence of anaemia were positively associated, and being Black was negatively associated, with post-vaccination infection. We found no studies looking at risk factors following a single dose of vaccine or the disease profile in vaccinated, community-based individuals. Previous studies in unvaccinated populations have shown that social and occupational factors influence the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and that personal factors (eg, age, male sex, multiple morbidities, and frailty) increase the risk for adverse outcomes in COVID-19. Phase 3 clinical trials have shown good efficacy for BNT162b2 (tozinameran; Pfizer-BioNTech), ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Oxford-AstraZeneca), and mRNA-1273 (elasomeran; Moderna) vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 infection, supported by published real-world data, with vaccines also reducing the risk of adverse outcomes, including hospitalisation and death. We found two published studies of in-vitro and early real-world evidence suggesting that BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccines might be less effective against emerging variants of concern than against the original outbreak variant.\n Added value of this study \nTo our knowledge, this observational study was the first to investigate the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection after first and second COVID-19 vaccinations. Vaccination (compared with no vaccination) was associated with reduced odds of hospitalisation or having more than five symptoms in the first week of illness following the first or second dose, and long-duration (&gt;=28 days) symptoms following the second dose. Almost all symptoms were reported less frequently in infected vaccinated than in infected unvaccinated individuals, and vaccinated participants were more likely to be completely asymptomatic, especially if they were 60 years or older. In our risk factor analysis, we found that frailty was associated with post-vaccination infection in older adults (&gt;=60 years) after their first vaccine dose. Adverse determinants of health, such as living in highly deprived areas and obesity, were associated with an increased likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 infection following the first vaccine dose.\n Implications of all the available evidence \nSome individuals still become infected with SARS-CoV-2 after vaccination; our data suggest that frail, older adults and those living in more deprived areas are at increased risk. However, COVID-19 appears to be less severe in vaccinated versus unvaccinated individuals. Our results are relevant for health policies post-vaccination and highlight the need to balance personal protective measures in those at risk of post-vaccination infection with the adverse effects from ongoing social restrictions. Strategies, such as timely prioritisation of booster vaccinations and optimised infection control measures, could be considered for at-risk groups. Research is also needed on how to enhance the immune response to vaccination in those at higher risk of post-vaccination infection.\nIdentifying and protecting individuals at increased risk of post-vaccination infection is becoming increasingly salient as more people are vaccinated. Groups at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection before vaccines became available included frontline health-care workers and individuals from areas of greater relative deprivation (probably reflecting increased exposure), and increasing age, male sex, multimorbidity, and frailty are associated with poorer COVID-19 outcomes. A study of fully vaccinated US veterans showed that older age and the presence of anaemia were positively associated with post-vaccination infection, and Black individuals were at a lower risk than White individuals. However, this study was done in a fully vaccinated, older (median age 73 years [IQR 68-78]), and predominantly male cohort, and did not assess lifestyle and sociodemographic risk factors for post-vaccination infection.\nIndividuals with COVID-19 have differing symptoms and clinical needs. Elucidating symptom profiles in individuals with COVID-19 after vaccination has clinical utility, facilitating the identification of risk groups for intervention, predicting medical resource requirements, and informing appropriate testing guidelines. Additionally, some unvaccinated individuals with COVID-19 have prolonged illness duration (so-called long COVID), and whether vaccination reduces the risk of long COVID is currently unknown.\nTherefore, we aimed to (1) describe individual risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection at least 14 days after first vaccination or 7 days after second vaccination, and (2) assess illness duration, severity, and symptom profile in individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection after their first and second vaccinations, compared with unvaccinated individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nMethods\nStudy design and participants\nThis prospective, community-based, nested, case-control study used data from UK-based, adult (&gt;=18 years) participants of the COVID Symptom Study logged through a free mobile phone app developed by ZOE (London, UK) and King's College London (London, UK). The app was launched in the UK on March 24, 2020, and by July 4, 2021, had nearly 4 5 million unique participants providing data by self-report or proxy report. At registration, each participant reported baseline demographic information (eg, age, sex, ethnicity, weight, height, and health-care worker status), geographical location, and information on health risk factors, including comorbidities, lifestyle, frailty, visits to hospital, and adherence to mask-wearing guidance. Participants were encouraged to self-report any of 32 prespecified symptoms (appendix p 1) daily, providing prospective longitudinal information on incident symptoms. Those with new symptoms were prompted to book and take a SARS-CoV-2 test. All users were encouraged to record any SARS-CoV-2 testing results (whether prompted by the app or otherwise), and, from Dec 11, 2020, any SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and subsequent symptoms. Users with missing or inconsistent information were excluded from our analysis. The inclusion process for cases and controls is shown in the appendix (p 14).\nCases had received a first or second dose of a COVID-19 vaccine since Dec 8, 2020; had either a positive RT-PCR test or lateral flow antigen test (LFAT) at least 14 days after their first vaccination (but before their second; cases 1) or a positive RT-PCR test or LFAT at least 7 days after their second vaccination (cases 2); and had no positive SARS-CoV-2 test before vaccination. If more than one positive test result was reported, only the first positive test was selected. To identify risk factors for post-vaccination infection, we selected two control groups among the vaccinated (since Dec 8, 2020) UK-based adult users of the COVID Symptom Study app who had not tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 before vaccination: a control group of users reporting a negative RT-PCR test or LFAT at least 14 days after their first vaccination but before their second (controls 1) and a control group of users reporting a negative RT-PCR test or LFAT at least 7 days after their second vaccination (controls 2). Controls 1 and controls 2 were matched (1:1) with cases 1 and cases 2, respectively, by use of the date of the post-vaccination COVID-19 test, health-care worker status, and sex. If multiple negative tests were reported, the last test date was used for matching.\nTo compare the disease profile of SARS-CoV-2 infection before and after vaccination, we sub-selected participants from cases 1 and cases 2 who had used the app for at least 14 consecutive days after testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (denoted as cases 3 and cases 4, respectively), so that symptoms of infection could be assessed. Controls for the disease profile analysis were those who reported a SARS-CoV-2-positive RT-PCR test or LFAT, were unvaccinated until data censoring, and had used the app for at least 14 consecutive days after the test. Among these users, two groups were formed: controls 3 and controls 4, matching (1:1) with cases 3 and cases 4, respectively, by the date of the positive COVID-19 test, health-care worker status, sex, body-mass index (BMI), and age. Individuals in all case and control groups who did not report an RT-PCR or LFAT test after Dec 8, 2020, were excluded.\nFor all control groups, we used a matching algorithm based on minimum Euclidean distance between the vectors of the covariates, with age, BMI, and the date of the test as numerical variables, and sex as a binary variable multiplied by 100 to ensure balance between covariate strengths. We considered health-care worker status, coded as a a categorical variable in the app, as a numerical variable (0=not a health-care worker; 1=health-care worker who does not interact with patients; 2=health-care worker who does not treat patients; 3=health-care worker who interacts with patients; 4=health-care worker who treats patients). Participants could only choose one of these options.\nAll app users provided digital informed consent for data usage for COVID-19-related research. In the UK, the app and the study were approved by King's College London's ethics committee (REMAS number 18210; reference LRS-19/20-18210).\nRisk factor variable definitions\nFor this analysis, the outcome variable was case status (a self-reported positive RT-PCR test or LFAT for SARS-CoV-2). We considered a priori-defined risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection based on previous evidence in unvaccinated individuals: age; BMI; self-reported comorbidities (ie, cancer, diabetes, asthma, lung disease, heart disease, and kidney disease), analysed individually as binary variables; dependency level (frailty) assessed by the PRISMA-7 questionnaire, which is embedded in app registration, as a binary variable (PRISMA-7 score &gt;=3 defined as frail and &lt;3 defined as not frail); local area Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD; a score ranging from 1 [most deprived] to 10 [least deprived] estimating relative locality deprivation derived from postal code and lower layer super output area) divided into low IMD (1-3), intermediate IMD (4-7), and high IMD (8-10) groups; and four healthy lifestyle factors (no current smoking, no obesity [BMI &lt;30 kg/m2], physical activity at least once per week [non-sedentary], and a healthy diet pattern; appendix p 17). We also calculated a healthy lifestyle score on the basis of these four lifestyle factors, by which participants received 1 point for each healthy lifestyle factor and the sum of the scores gave a total healthy lifestyle score ranging from 0 to 4, with higher scores indicating a healthier lifestyle (appendix p 17).\nDisease severity, duration, and symptom definitions\nTo compare the disease profile in vaccinated versus unvaccinated individuals testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, we assessed disease severity (asymptomatic or symptomatic; more than five symptoms or five or fewer symptoms reported in the first week of illness; and self-reported presentation to hospital or no hospital presentation), illness duration (duration of &lt;28 days or &gt;=28 days), and individual symptom reports. Vaccination status was the exposure. For cases, controls 3, and controls 4, symptoms were considered within a window between 3 days before the COVID-19 test date and up to 14 days after the test date (appendix p 1). This window was used because it might have taken up to 3 days to request an RT-PCR test and receive a result following symptom onset, and symptoms can occur up to 14 days following SARS-CoV-2 exposure.\nStatistical analysis\nData were extracted and pre-processed by use of ExeTera13, a Python library developed at King's College London (version 0.5.5) that is openly available on GitHub. Statistical analyses used Python 3.7 and the packages NumPy (version 1.19.2), Pandas (version 1.1.3), SciPy (version 1.5.2), and statsmodels (version 0.12.1).\nIn the risk factor analysis, we assessed the differences in proportions and means of covariates between cases and respective controls using Fisher's exact test for categorical variables and Wilcoxon's test for continuous variables. p values of 0 05 or less were considered statistically significant. Univariate logistic regression models (adjusted for age, BMI, and sex) and multivariate logistic regression models of age and BMI (adjusted for sex) were used to analyse the associations between risk factor variables and post-vaccination infection. Because associated factors might differ by age group, analyses were stratified by sex (male and female) and age (younger adults were those aged 18-59 years and older adults were those aged &gt;=60 years). To examine whether health-conscious behaviours might explain the association between lifestyle factors and post-vaccination infection, we further adjusted models for reported individual adherence to mask-wearing guidance from June 12, 2020, to Sept 29, 2020. Multivariate logistic regression (adjusted for age, BMI, and sex) was used to assess the independence of frailty, IMD category, and the four healthy lifestyle factors.\nFor sensitivity analyses, we examined models via inverse probability weighting to check for potential index event bias of vaccination using weights derived from probabilities of being vaccinated in the population tested and active on the app during the study period (appendix p 15). Data from 1 531 762 app users reporting an RT-PCR or LFAT test within the study period were processed to obtain weights for inverse probability weighting of being vaccinated. Weights were estimated from a logistic regression model for predicting vaccination, which included confounders known to be associated with vaccination status: frailty, IMD, and the comorbidities of cancer, diabetes, lung disease, heart disease, kidney disease, and asthma.\nIn the disease profile analysis, univariate logistic regression models adjusted by age, BMI, and sex were used to assess the association of individual symptoms, overall illness duration, and disease severity (outcomes) with vaccination status (exposure). Symptoms were examined if they were reported by more than 1% of app users reporting a positive test. We also provide models that were adjusted for frailty and the presence of at least one comorbidity, given the association of these factors with the exposure (vaccination) and outcome (symptoms), which could confound observed associations.\nFor all regression analyses, odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were calculated. Analyses were not corrected for multiple testing. This study reports on vaccination with BNT162b2, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, and mRNA-1273 only, as there were no positive cases among the few people who had received other vaccines.\nRole of the funding source\nThe funders of the study had no role in study design, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. ZOE, funded by the UK Department of Health and Social Care, made the COVID Symptom Study app available for data collection as a not-for-profit endeavour. Representatives of ZOE approved the final manuscript for submission.\nResults\nBetween Dec 8, 2020, and July 4, 2021 (date of data census), 1 240 009 app users reported a first dose (442 752 with BNT162b2, 750 137 with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, and 17 958 with mRNA-1273) and 971 504 reported a second dose (330 760 with BNT162b2, 625 088 with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, and 3417 with mRNA-1273) of a COVID-19 vaccine. 6030 (0 5%) of 1 240 009 app users reported testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 at least 14 days after their first vaccination but before their second (cases 1) and 2370 (0 2%) of 971 504 reported testing positive at least 7 days after their second dose (cases 2). Users were infected with SARS-CoV-2 a mean of 73 days (SD 44; median 67 days [IQR 33-106]) after their first vaccination and a mean of 51 days (SD 30; median 44 days [29-68]) after their second vaccination (appendix p 16).\nCharacteristics of case participants with COVID-19 after their first or second vaccination and vaccinated control participants without COVID-19 in the risk factor analysis\n		Cases 1	Cases 2	Controls 1	Controls 2	 			Total (n=6030)	18-59 years (n=3931)	&gt;=60 years (n=2099)	Total (n=2370)	18-59 years (n=1336)	&gt;=60 years (n=1034)	Total (n=6030)	18-59 years (n=4196)	&gt;=60 years (n=1834)	Total (n=2370)	18-59 years (n=1499)	&gt;=60 years (n=871)	 	Demographics	 	Sex	 		Female	3766 (62 5%)	2565 (65 3%)	1201 (57 2%)	1451 (61 2%)	882 (66 0%)	569 (55 0%)	3766 (62 5%);

The p values indicate the difference between cases 1 and controls 1, or between cases 2 and controls 2, and were not adjusted for multiple testing.\nInsufficient sample size to calculate p value.\nWe only included those who answered the relevant questionnaire in the healthy lifestyle factors analysis.\nIn the risk factor analysis, positive and negative tests were confirmed by RT-PCR in around 70% of both cases and controls after their first vaccine dose (appendix p 1). After the second vaccine dose, controls reported a higher proportion of tests by RT-PCR (2020 [85 2%] of 2370) than did cases (1570 [66 2%] of 2370; appendix p 1). There was a higher proportion of female participants than male participants in all groups in the risk factor analysis, cases were significantly younger (p&lt;0 0001) than their respective control groups, and participants in cases 1 had a significantly higher BMI (p=0 0074) than did participants in controls 1 (table 1).\nAsthma and lung disease were the most commonly reported comorbidities (table 1). There was a significant difference in the prevalence of several individual comorbidities between groups, including cancer (more prevalent in older adults in the control groups than in the case groups), diabetes (more prevalent in younger adults in controls 1 than in cases 1), lung disease (more prevalent in older adults in cases 1 than in controls 1), and asthma (more prevalent in older adults in cases 1 than in controls 1 and more prevalent in cases 2 than in controls 2; table 1). There were also significant differences in vaccine type between groups, with significantly higher proportions of cases than controls receiving ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, and significantly higher proportions of controls than cases receiving BNT162b2 across all groups (table 1). Only 86 of 17 958 individuals and one of 3417 individuals reported SARS-CoV-2 infection following their first and second dose of the mRNA-1273 vaccine in this study, respectively.\nUnivariate analysis of post-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infection risk factors\nUnivariate models for frailty and each individual comorbidity (A) and IMD, healthy lifestyle factors, and healthy lifestyle score (B), adjusted for age, body-mass index, and sex, and stratified by age group. The error bars represent 95% CIs. A low IMD means high deprivation and a high IMD means low deprivation. The reference category for the IMD is an intermediate IMD (4-7). IMD=Index of Multiple Deprivation.\nIn the multivariate analysis of age and BMI, adjusted for sex, we found a significant inverse association between age and post-vaccination infection that was more evident in older adults after the first dose (OR 0 94 per year increase in age, 95% CI 0 93-0 95; p&lt;0 0001) and after the second (0 93, 0 92-0 95; p&lt;0 0001) than in younger adults (appendix p 2). In univariate logistic regression models adjusted for age, BMI, and sex, frailty was associated with post-vaccination infection in older adults following their first vaccine dose (OR 1 93, 95% CI 1 50-2 48; p&lt;0 0001; figure 1A; appendix p 2), an association that remained consistent in our sensitivity analysis using inverse probability weighting for factors influencing vaccination (appendix p 3). 30 (23%) of 130 frail older adults presented to hospital after testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 following their first vaccine dose and two (6%) of 36 frail older adults presented to hospital after testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 following their second vaccine dose. In older adults who had received their first vaccine dose but not their second, kidney disease (OR 1 95, 95% CI 1 14-3 31; p=0 014), heart disease (1 30, 1 03-1 65; p=0 031), and lung disease (1 27, 1 02-1 59; p=0 030) were associated with post-vaccination infection (appendix p 2; figure 1A).\nFull results of our sensitivity analysis using inverse probability weighting for factors influencing vaccination (frailty, each comorbidity, and IMD categories) can be found in the appendix (pp 3-4). Generally, our sensitivity analysis confirmed the results of our main analysis; however, beyond frailty, older adults with asthma and lung disease had a significantly increased odds of infection after their first vaccine dose in our sensitivity analysis (appendix p 3). Furthermore, a significantly decreased odds of post-vaccination infection were found in younger adults with frailty following their first and second vaccine doses, in younger adults with heart disease following their second vaccine dose, and in younger adults with diabetes following their first vaccine dose (appendix p 3).\nCompared with the intermediate IMD category, users living in areas with the highest deprivation (a low IMD of 1-3) had increased odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection following their first vaccine dose (OR 1 11, 95% CI 1 01-1 23; p=0 039), and users living in areas with the lowest deprivation (a high IMD of 8-10) had decreased odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection following their first vaccine dose (0 91, 0 84-0 98; p=0 017; figure 1B; appendix p 3). Individuals without obesity had decreased odds of infection following their first vaccine dose, which was seen in the main analysis in all age groups (OR 0 84, 95% CI 0 75-0 94; p=0 0030; figure 1B; appendix p 3) and in older adults in the inverse probability weighting sensitivity analysis (appendix p 4). The results of our univariate analysis remained similar after adjusting for adherence to mask wearing (appendix p 16).\nMultivariate analysis of post-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infection risk factors\nThe multivariate analysis was adjusted for age, body-mass index, and sex, and was stratified by age group. The error bars represent 95% CIs. A low IMD means high deprivation and a high IMD means low deprivation. The reference category for the IMD is an intermediate IMD (4-7). IMD=Index of Multiple Deprivation.\nIn multivariate analyses adjusted by age, BMI, and sex (figure 2), lower deprivation (for all ages) and non-obesity (for younger adults and all ages) were independently associated with post-vaccination infection following the first vaccine dose (appendix p 5). However, frailty was not significantly associated with post-vaccination infection after the first or second dose in any age group (figure 2; appendix p 5). The findings of the multivariate analysis were broadly consistent following our sensitivity analysis using inverse probability weighting for factors influencing vaccination (appendix p 6).\nFor our analysis of symptom duration and disease severity, we used data collected up to July 18, 2021, to ensure that all participants had at least 28 days post-vaccination for symptom reporting. Among the 6030 app users in cases 1, 3825 had at least 14 days of app use after testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (cases 3; median duration of app use 79 days [IQR 30-135]), and, among the 2370 app users in cases 2, 906 had at least 14 days of app use after testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (cases 4; median duration of app use 27 days [IQR 20-45]). After the first vaccine dose, positive tests were by RT-PCR in 70 0% of cases and in 49 2% of controls, although 41 3% of controls did not report on the type of test done (appendix p 6). After the second vaccine dose, the proportion of tests done by RT-PCR was similar for both cases and controls (appendix p 6).\nCharacteristics of case participants with COVID-19 after their first or second vaccination and unvaccinated control participants with COVID-19 in the disease profile analysis\n		Cases 3	Cases 4	Controls 3	Controls 4	 			Total (n=3825)	18-59 years (n=2320)	&gt;=60 years (n=1505)	Total (n=906)	18-59 years (n=455)	&gt;=60 years (n=451)	Total (n=3825)	18-59 years (n=2363)	&gt;=60 years (n=1462)	Total (n=906)	18-59 years (n=474)	&gt;=60 years (n=432)	 	Demographics	 	Sex	 		Female	2460 (64 3%)	1578 (68 0%)	882 (58 6%)	561 (61 9%)	305 (67 0%)	256 (56 8%)	2462 (64 4%); p=0 98	1590 (67 3%); p=0 60	872 (59 6%); p=0 58	553 (61 0%); p=0 74	296 (62 4%); p=0 15	257 (59 5%); p=0 41	 		Male	1365 (35 7%)	742 (32 0%)	623 (41 4%)	345 (38 1%)	150 (33 0%)	195 (43 2%)	1363 (35 6%)	773 (32 7%)	590 (40 4%)	353 (39 0%)	178 (37 6%)	175 (40 5%)	 	Age, years	52 0 (14 2)	43 2 (9 0)	65 6 (9 0)	54 5 (14 3)	43 4 (9 6)	65 7 (8 4)	51 5 (14 2); p=0 20	42 9 (9 3); p=0 25	65 4 (8 8); p=0 22	53 7 (13 8); p=0 55	43 6 (9 6); p=0 36	64 9 (7 9); p=0 084	 	Body-mass index, kg/m2	27 2 (6 8)	27 3 (6 9)	27 1 (6 7)	26 9 (7 3)	27 3 (7 7)	26 5 (7 0)	27 2 (6 6); p=0 71	27 3 (6 8); p=0 44	27 1 (6 2); p=0 28	26 9 (6 7); p=0 83	27 2 (7 0); p=0 45	26 6 (6 2); p=0 19	 	Health-care worker	683 (17 9%)	475 (20 5%)	208 (13 8%)	124 (13 7%)	90 (19 8%)	34 (7 5%)	572 (15 0%); p=0 0006	393 (16 6%); p=0 0008	179 (12 2%); p=0 21	91 (10 0%); p=0 020	58 (12 2%); p=0 0022	33 (7 6%); p=1 0	 	Comorbidities	 	Frailty	215 (5 6%)	49 (2 1%)	166 (11 0%)	51 (5 6%)	14 (3 1%)	37 (8 2%)	138 (3 6%); p&lt;0 0001	24 (1 0%); p=0 0029	114 (7 8%); p=0 0031	21 (2 3%); p=0 0004	4 (0 8%); p=0 016	17 (3 9%); p=0 018	 	Presence of at least one comorbidity	891 (23 3%)	453 (19 5%)	438 (29 1%)	236 (26 0%)	111 (24 4%)	125 (27 7%)	809 (21 2%); p=0 026	391 (16 5%); p=0 0087	418 (28 6%); p=0 78	207 (22 8%); p=0 13	76 (16 0%); p=0 0018	131 (30 3%); p=0 41	 	Disease characteristics*	 	Asymptomatic infection	672/3683 (18 2%)	331/2234 (14 8%)	341/1449 (23 5%)	183/887 (20 6%)	66/444 (14 9%)	117/443 (26 4%)	414/3445 (12 0%); p&lt;0 0001	242/2121 (11 4%); p=0 0009	172/1324 (13 0%); p&lt;0 0001	98/835 (11 7%); p&lt;0 0001	45/425 (10 6%); p=0 067	53/410 (12 9%); p&lt;0 0001	 	Hospitalised	147/3791 (3 9%)	64/2298 (2 8%)	83/1493 (5 6%)	20/897 (2 2%)	11/451 (2 4%)	9/446 (2 0%)	397/3726 (10 7%); p&lt;0 0001	142/2297 (6 2%); p&lt;0 0001	255/1429 (17 8%); p&lt;0 0001	64/867 (7 4%); p&lt;0 0001	18/445 (4 0%); p=0 19	46/422 (10 9%); p&lt;0 0001	 	More than five reported symptoms	551/2479 (22 2%)	368/1430 (25 7%)	183/1049 (17 4%)	121/592 (20 4%)	71/286 (24 8%)	50/306 (16 3%)	868/2762 (31 4%); p&lt;0 0001	515/1540 (33 4%); p&lt;0 0001	353/1222 (28 9%); p&lt;0 0001	141/482 (29 3%); p=0 0010	71/223 (31 8%); p=0 090	70/259 (27 0%); p=0 0027	 	Symptoms lasting &gt;=28 days	229/2479 (9 2%)	124/1430 (8 7%)	105/1049 (10 0%)	31/592 (5 2%)	9/286 (3 1%)	22/306 (7 2%)	296/2762 (10 7%); p=0 080	121/1540 (7 9%); p=0 42	175/1222 (14 3%); p=0 0020	55/482 (11 4%); p=0 0002	16/223 (7 2%); p=0 040	39/259 (15 1%); p=0 0040	 	Reporting	 	Duration of reporting, days	180 7 (51 5)	174 4 (55 6)	191 4 (41 5)	192 1 (42 7)	184 5 (49 9)	201 0 (30 0)	155 7 (64 6); p&lt;0 0001	150 4 (65 8); p&lt;0 0001	164 4 (61 7); p&lt;0 0001	178 7 (51 0); p&lt;0 0001	171 3 (55 9); p=0 0006	186 7 (43 7); p&lt;0 0001	 	Proportion of missing daily reports, %	50% (30)	60% (30)	50% (20)	50% (30)	60% (30)	40% (20)	60% (30); p&lt;0 0001	70% (30); p&lt;0 0001	50% (30); p=0 13	60% (30); p&lt;0 0001	70% (30); p=0 0011	50% (30); p=0 48	 	\nData are n (%), n (%); p value, n/N (%), n/N (%); p value, or mean (SD). The p values indicate the difference between cases 3 and controls 3, or between cases 4 and controls 4, and were not adjusted for multiple testing.\nOnly users with information on hospitalisation, symptoms, and disease duration were included in the analysis.\nDisease severity and duration factors in SARS-CoV-2-infected vaccinated versus unvaccinated participants\nUnivariate models were adjusted for age, body-mass index, and sex, and stratified by age group. The error bars represent 95% CIs.\nFollowing matching, there was still a significantly higher prevalence of health-care workers in cases 3 (compared with controls 3) and cases 4 (compared with controls 4; table 2). In univariate models adjusted by age, BMI, and sex, there were lower odds of long-duration (&gt;=28 days) symptoms following two vaccine doses for all participants (OR 0 51, 95% CI 0 32-0 82; p=0 0060; appendix p 7). Compared with unvaccinated controls, individuals after their first or second vaccine dose were less likely to have more than five symptoms in the first week of illness or present to hospital, and were more likely to be completely asymptomatic, especially if they were 60 years or older (figure 3; appendix p 7).\nSymptoms in SARS-CoV-2-infected vaccinated versus unvaccinated participants\nUnivariate models were adjusted for age, body-mass index, and sex, and stratified by age group. The error bars represent 95% CIs. We present only symptoms reported by more than 1% of users.\nFor our symptom reports, we used data collected up to July 4, 2021. Symptom frequencies for participants testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 after their first or second vaccination and for unvaccinated control participants can be found in the appendix (pp 7-9). Vaccination was associated with lower symptom reporting for almost all symptoms across all age groups (figure 4; appendix pp 9-10). One exception was sneezing (sternutation), which was more common in vaccinated individuals than in unvaccinated controls after the first vaccine dose, although only when considering all age groups and younger adults (appendix pp 9-10). When considering all age groups, no differences were found between cases and controls for chest pain, lymphadenopathy (swollen glands), and earache following first or second vaccine doses; dyspnoea (shortness of breath) following the second dose; brain fog following the first dose; or sneezing following the second dose. Results from the univariate analysis remained similar after further adjustment for frailty and the presence of at least one comorbidity (appendix pp 11-13).\nDiscussion\nWe present data on 6030 and 2370 community-based adults in the UK with test-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection after their first or second COVID-19 vaccinations, respectively, with BNT162b2, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, or mRNA-1273. Participants were included if they tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at least 14 days after their first vaccination or at least 7 days after their second vaccination when immunity had developed and infection was unlikely to be due to exposure around the time of vaccination (eg, when travelling to the vaccination centre).\nWe found that the odds of having symptoms for 28 days or more after post-vaccination infection were approximately halved by having two vaccine doses. This result suggests that the risk of long COVID is reduced in individuals who have received double vaccination, when additionally considering the already documented reduced risk of infection overall.\nAlmost all individual symptoms of COVID-19 were less common in vaccinated versus unvaccinated participants, and more people in the vaccinated than in the unvaccinated groups were completely asymptomatic. This increased incidence of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic infection in vaccinated participants underlines the importance of individuals who interact with unvaccinated or clinically vulnerable groups (eg, health-care workers and social care workers) continuing to regularly take tests for SARS-CoV-2, even if vaccinated, in line with current UK testing guidelines. We also found that COVID-19 was less severe (both in terms of the number of symptoms in the first week of infection and the need for hospitalisation) in participants after their first or second vaccine doses compared with unvaccinated participants. We have previously shown that having more than five symptoms in the first week of infection was associated with COVID-19 severity and disease duration.\nFrailty was associated with post-vaccination infection in older adults following their first vaccine dose, highlighting the need for ongoing caution in this clinically vulnerable group. The association was consistent in our sensitivity analysis using inverse probability weighting for factors influencing vaccination, but not after adjusting for potential confounders such as local area deprivation and lifestyle. This increased risk might therefore reflect increased exposure: unlike non-frail older adults, frail older adults might require carer visits or attendance at health-care facilities. Frail adults in long-term care facilities are at particular risk of transmitting respiratory illness, and have been disproportionately affected throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Another explanation for this result concerns altered immune function (immunosenescence), a well established feature of physiological ageing. The increased odds of post-vaccination infection in frail older adults could be compounded by the more severe outcomes of COVID-19 in this group, including delirium and death; indeed, in our study, 23% of frail, older adults testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 after their first vaccination presented to hospital. Systematic frailty screening in acute and community-based settings might facilitate differential, targeted re-vaccination scheduling, appropriate isolation precautions, case detection, testing, and proactive care, as recommended in guidance published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and National Health Service (NHS) England. Research on augmenting immunogenicity in frail individuals is needed, such as on the impact and timing of booster vaccinations.\nWe found an inverse association of age with the odds of post-vaccination infection, especially in older adults. This finding is consistent with a previous study in non-vaccinated individuals showing lower anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroprevalence in older adults (&gt;=65 years) compared with younger adults (35-44 years), perhaps reflecting shielding in this age group in accordance with the classification of individuals older than 70 years as clinically vulnerable. Our study found some evidence to suggest that kidney disease might increase the odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection in older adults after their first vaccine dose, which is notable given that individuals with kidney disease were under-represented in the phase 2 and phase 3 trials of the COVID-19 vaccines. However, this finding should be interpreted cautiously because of the relatively small numbers of participants with kidney disease in this study. This increased risk of post-vaccination infection for people with kidney disease could reflect increased exposure (eg, when attending dialysis appointments) or impaired immunogenicity, and is supported by a study looking at humoral and B-cell responses in vaccinated, immunosuppressed kidney transplant recipients and patients having dialysis. Several other comorbidities, including heart disease and lung disease, were significantly associated with post-vaccination infection after one dose in older adults; although associations of marginal significance should be interpreted cautiously, many of these comorbidities confer a higher risk of severe disease, hospitalisation, mechanical ventilation, and mortality from COVID-19, and ongoing shielding behaviours could be influencing our results to reduce the strength of these associations.\nGreater area-level deprivation was associated with increased odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection after a single vaccine dose, consistent with findings from the pre-vaccination era. This association persisted following further adjustment for compliance with infection control guidance (ie, mask wearing). Factors associated with increased area-level deprivation include higher population density and more ethnic diversity, which are in themselves associated with increased mortality from COVID-19. More deprived areas might have lower vaccination coverage for COVID-19, and our finding might reflect increased viral transmission. Our results suggest that health policies to mitigate infection might need to specifically target these areas. Conversely, individuals without obesity had a lower odds of infection following their first vaccine dose. This finding suggests that immune responses post-vaccination might be influenced by obesity, although unadjusted confounding remains a possibility.\nOur observation of differences by vaccine type agrees with real-world UK data on the effectiveness of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and BNT162b2 against the delta variant (B.1.617.2); however, our observation should be treated cautiously given the confounding factors influencing the vaccine type administered in different age groups and demographics. We emphasise that our study is observational, rather than a formal comparison.\nOur study has some limitations. Although we used data from a large population of individuals reporting on a mobile phone app, the sample contained disproportionately more women than men and under-represented individuals in more deprived areas. Furthermore, we were unable to analyse the impact of ethnicity due to the low number of participants who provided this information, and our findings might not apply at all timepoints post-vaccination, to settings with different proportions of SARS-CoV-2 variants, or to countries with a different vaccination schedule. Additionally, the data were self-reported; recording of comorbidities, test results, and vaccination status might not have been completely accurate and there might have been temporal gaps in reporting. Users of the COVID Symptom Study app are asked to log daily; therefore, if a participant reports on alternate days, the proportion of missing daily entries is 50%. However, given the typical duration of COVID-19 symptoms, the sampling frequencies in the COVID Symptom Study should have allowed good characterisation of infections.\nOur study has strengths. Previous data from the COVID Symptom Study have concurred well with population-based COVID-19 studies, including on the influence of sociodemographic factors. The mobile phone data collection method allows the collection of daily prospective information on a comprehensive set of symptoms, permitting the analysis of both individual symptoms and overall illness duration (although necessary data censoring could have underestimated symptom duration in both cases and controls, as some individuals only had 2 weeks of logging after their positive test result).\nThe design of our study, including matching cases and controls for health-care worker status and the date of the post-vaccination test, reduced the potential for bias, although small differences between the groups remained on matched variables. We acknowledge the potential differences in logging by vaccinated individuals or those undertaking regular testing (eg, required for work as a health-care worker). Access to testing is a potential source of bias: as of July, 2021, RT-PCR is recommended for symptomatic individuals and a LFAT is recommended for asymptomatic individuals in the UK. The risk of reporting a positive SARS-CoV-2 test is higher among frontline health-care workers than among the general population, probably reflecting increased exposure and testing. After the first vaccine dose, positive tests were by RT-PCR in a higher proportion of vaccinated cases than in unvaccinated controls. Because RT-PCR is used for symptomatic testing in the UK, this would bias away our finding of a higher likelihood of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic COVID-19 in vaccinated versus unvaccinated participants. However, there is uncertainty due to the high numbers of unvaccinated controls who reported an unknown test type after their first vaccine dose.\nOur data suggest that the risk of post-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infection is reduced in older age groups. To examine the effect of age on post-vaccination infection, we did not match controls 1 and controls 2 by age. However, age was included as a covariate in all analyses other than that looking at the effect of age itself, and stratified analyses are presented for younger and older age groups. Although vaccination itself might be considered a potential index event bias, the population of interest in this study was the vaccinated population, and findings should not be construed as applying to those who are unvaccinated. The UK adopted a vaccine prioritisation strategy starting with older age groups, so older adults were more likely to be vaccinated in this study than were younger adults. We examined and found no evidence of event bias on the basis of the probability of being vaccinated. Analyses in this study were not corrected for multiple testing, and so observations of marginal significance should be interpreted cautiously.\nFrailty was assessed with the PRISMA-7 questionnaire. This assessment correlates well with other frailty measures and has the advantage of focusing on the functional consequences of frailty, which are not routinely captured in health records. However, PRISMA-7 has only been validated in older adults; results in younger adults should be interpreted cautiously.\nTo conclude, the odds of post-vaccination infection following the first dose were increased in frail, older adults and in those living in more deprived areas, and were decreased in individuals without obesity. Compared with unvaccinated controls, after their second vaccine dose, individuals were less likely to have prolonged illness (symptoms for &gt;=28 days), more than five symptoms in the first week of illness, or present to hospital. Most symptoms were less common in vaccinated versus unvaccinated participants. Fully vaccinated individuals with COVID-19, especially if they were 60 years or older, were more likely to be completely asymptomatic than were unvaccinated controls. This finding might support caution around relaxing physical distancing and other personal protective measures in the post-vaccination era, particularly around frail older adults and individuals living in more deprived areas, even if these individuals are vaccinated. Our findings might also have implications for strategies such as booster vaccinations.\nData sharing\nDeidentified participant data collected in the COVID Symptom Study smartphone app can be shared with other health researchers through the NHS-funded Health Data Research UK and Secure Anonymised Information Linkage consortium, housed in the UK Secure Research Platform (Swansea, UK).

impact of COVID-19 on patients with cancer (CCC19): a cohort study","abstract":"Background\nData on patients with COVID-19 who have cancer are lacking.\n\n Here we characterise the outcomes of a cohort of patients with cancer and COVID-19 and identify potential prognostic factors for mortality and severe illness.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this cohort study, we collected de-identified data on patients with active or previous malignancy, aged 18 years and older, with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection from the USA, Canada, and Spain from the COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium (CCC19) database for whom baseline data were added between March 17 and April 16, 2020. We collected data on baseline clinical conditions, medications, cancer diagnosis and treatment, and COVID-19 disease course.\n\n The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality within 30 days of diagnosis of COVID-19. We assessed the association between the outcome and potential prognostic variables using logistic regression analyses, partially adjusted for age, sex, smoking status, and obesity.\n\n This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.\n\ngov, NCT04354701, and is ongoing.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 1035 records entered into the CCC19 database during the study period, 928 patients met inclusion criteria for our analysis.\n\n Median age was 66 years (IQR 57–76), 279 (30%) were aged 75 years or older, and 468 (50%) patients were male.\n\n The most prevalent malignancies were breast (191 [21%]) and prostate (152 [16%]).\n\n 366 (39%) patients were on active anticancer treatment, and 396 (43%) had active (measurable) cancer.\n\n At analysis (May 7, 2020), 121 (13%) patients had died.\n\n In logistic regression analysis, independent factors associated with increased 30-day mortality, after partial adjustment, were: increased age (per 10 years; partially adjusted odds ratio 1·84, 95% CI 1·53–2·21), male sex (1·63, 1·07–2·48), smoking status (former smoker vs never smoked: 1·60, 1·03–2·47), number of comorbidities (two vs none: 4·50, 1·33–15·28), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 or higher (status of 2 vs 0 or 1: 3·89, 2·11–7·18), active cancer (progressing vs remission: 5·20, 2·77–9·77), and receipt of azithromycin plus hydroxychloroquine (vs treatment with neither: 2·93, 1·79–4·79; confounding by indication cannot be excluded).\n\n Compared with residence in the US-Northeast, residence in Canada (0·24, 0·07–0·84) or the US-Midwest (0·50, 0·28–0·90) were associated with decreased 30-day all-cause mortality.\n\n Race and ethnicity, obesity status, cancer type, type of anticancer therapy, and recent surgery were not associated with mortality.\n\n\nInterpretation\nAmong patients with cancer and COVID-19, 30-day all-cause mortality was high and associated with general risk factors and risk factors unique to patients with cancer.\n\n Longer follow-up is needed to better understand the effect of COVID-19 on outcomes in patients with cancer, including the ability to continue specific cancer treatments.\n\n\nFunding\nAmerican Cancer Society, National Institutes of Health, and Hope Foundation for Cancer Research.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7255743","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Nicole

of non-virus-exposed cancer patients, recovered hematological cancer patients display distinct, lingering immunological legacies.\n Thus, while solid cancer patients, including those with advanced

(MPM) (20 chronic myeloid leukemias and 30 myeloproliferative neoplasms), all of them on active anti-cancer treatment, in comparison with 36 elderly controls not suffering from cancer.\n\n Subjects serologically and/or molecularly (by nasal/throat swab) positives at basal for SARS-CoV-2 were excluded.\n\n Primary endpoint was to compare titers of neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and

Feb 18, 2021. Participants who were vaccinated between Dec 8 and Dec 29, 2020, received two 30 ?g doses of BNT162b2 administered intramuscularly 21 days apart; patients vaccinated after this date received only one 30 ?g dose with a planned follow-up boost at 12 weeks.\n\n Blood samples were taken before vaccination and at 3 weeks and 5 weeks after the first vaccination.\n\n Where possible, serial nasopharyngeal real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) swab tests were done every 10 days or in cases of symptomatic COVID-19. The coprimary endpoints were seroconversion to SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein in patients with cancer following the first vaccination with the BNT162b2 vaccine and the effect of vaccine boosting after 21 days on seroconversion.\n\n All participants with available data were included in the safety and immunogenicity analyses.\n\n Ongoing follow-up is underway for further blood sampling after the delayed (12-week) vaccine boost.\n\n This study is registered with the NHS Health Research Authority and Health and Care Research Wales (REC ID 20/HRA/2031).\n\n\nFindings\n151 patients with cancer (95 patients with solid cancer and 56 patients with haematological cancer) and 54 healthy controls were enrolled.\n\n For this interim data analysis of the safety and immunogenicity of vaccinated patients with cancer, samples and data obtained up to March 19, 2021, were analysed.\n\n After exclusion of 17 patients who had been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 (detected by either antibody seroconversion or a positive rRT-PCR COVID-19 swab test) from the immunogenicity analysis, the proportion of positive anti-S IgG titres at approximately 21 days following a single vaccine inoculum across the three cohorts were 32 (94%; 95% CI 81–98) of 34 healthy controls; 21 (38%; 26–51) of 56 patients with solid cancer, and eight (18%; 10–32) of 44 patients with haematological cancer.\n\n 16 healthy controls, 25 patients with solid cancer, and six patients with haematological cancer received a second dose on day 21. Of the patients with available blood samples 2 weeks following a 21-day vaccine boost, and excluding 17 participants with evidence of previous natural SARS-CoV-2 exposure, 18 (95%; 95% CI 75–99) of 19 patients with solid cancer, 12 (100%; 76–100) of 12 healthy controls, and three (60%; 23–88) of five patients with haematological cancers were seropositive, compared with ten (30%; 17–47) of 33, 18 (86%; 65–95) of 21, and four (11%; 4–25) of 36, respectively, who did not receive a boost.\n\n The vaccine was well tolerated; no toxicities were reported in 75 (54%) of 140 patients with cancer following the first dose of BNT162b2, and in 22 (71%) of 31 patients with cancer following the second dose.\n\n Similarly, no toxicities were reported in 15 (38%) of 40 healthy controls after the first dose and in five (31%) of 16 after the second dose.\n\n Injection-site pain within 7 days following the first dose was the most commonly reported local reaction (23 [35%] of 65 patients with cancer; 12 [48%] of 25 healthy controls).\n\n No vaccine-related deaths were reported.\n\n\nInterpretation\nIn patients with cancer, one dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine yields poor efficacy.\n\n Immunogenicity increased significantly in patients with solid cancer within 2 weeks of a vaccine boost at day 21 after the first dose.\n\n These data support prioritisation of patients with cancer for an early (day 21) second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine.\n\n\nFunding\nKing's College London, Cancer Research UK, Wellcome Trust, Rosetrees Trust, and Francis Crick Institute.\n\n\n","id":"PMC8078907","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Lancet Pub.

responses to COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n The immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccine/infection in patients with solid tumors is reduced.\n\n We evaluated the immunologic response to COVID-19 and/or the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine among cancer patients on active treatments and reviewed previous literature to identify subgroups that may require third vaccination.\n\n\nPatients and methods\nAnti-SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 antibodies were measured in a cohort of 202 cancer patients on active treatment with chemotherapy (96), immunologic (52), biologic (46), and hormonal (12) treatments for early (n = 66, 32.7%) or metastatic disease (n = 136, 67.3%).\n\n Of those, 172 had received two vaccine doses, and 30 had COVID-19 infection (20/30 also received one dose of vaccine).\n\n Specific anti-S receptor-binding domain antibodies were further measured in patients with equivocal anti-S1/S2 results.\n\n\nResults\nAmong cancer patients, the SARS-CoV-2 antibody response rate was 89.1% (180/202) after COVID-19 vaccination or infection and 87.2% (150/172) in patients after vaccination without a history of COVID-19, compared with 100% positive serologic tests in a control group of 30 health care workers (P &lt; 0.001).\n\n Chemotherapy treatment was independently associated with significantly reduced humoral response to infection or vaccination, with an 81.3% response rate, compared with 96.2% in patients on other treatments (P = 0.001).\n\n In vaccinated patients on chemotherapy, the positive response rate was 77.5%.\n\n In a multiple regression model, a neutralizing antibody titer (&gt;60 AU/ml) was more likely with immunotherapy (odds ratio 2.44) and less likely with chemotherapy (odds ratio 0.39).\n\n\nConclusions\nOverall, both COVID-19 vaccine and natural infection are highly immunogenic among cancer patients.\n\n Our study, however, identifies those under chemotherapy as significantly less responsive, and with lower antibody levels.\n\n These findings justify close virological and serological surveillance along with consideration of these patients for booster (third dose) vaccine prioritization, as new highly spreading SARS-CoV-2 variants

severe disease and death if they develop COVID-19 and are therefore a priority for immunisation should an efficacious vaccine be developed.\n\n Immunogenicity of vaccines is often worse in older adults as a result of immunosenescence.\n\n We have reported the immunogenicity of a novel chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222), in young adults, and now describe the safety and immunogenicity of this vaccine in a wider range of participants, including adults aged 70 years and older.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this report of the phase 2 component of a single-blind, randomised, controlled, phase 2/3 trial (COV002), healthy adults aged 18 years and older were enrolled at two UK clinical research facilities, in an age-escalation manner, into 18–55 years, 56–69 years, and 70 years and older immunogenicity subgroups.\n\n Participants were eligible if they did not have severe or uncontrolled medical comorbidities or a high frailty score (if aged ?65 years).\n\n First, participants were recruited to a low-dose cohort, and within each age group, participants were randomly assigned to receive either intramuscular ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (2·2?×?1010 virus particles) or a control vaccine, MenACWY, using block randomisation and stratified by age and dose group and study site, using the following ratios: in the 18–55 years group, 1:1 to either two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or two doses of MenACWY; in the 56–69 years group, 3:1:3:1 to one dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, one dose of MenACWY, two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, or two doses of MenACWY; and in the 70 years and older, 5:1:5:1 to one dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, one dose of MenACWY, two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, or two doses of MenACWY.\n\n Prime-booster regimens were given 28 days apart.\n\n Participants were then recruited to the standard-dose cohort (3·5–6·5?×?1010 virus particles of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) and the same randomisation procedures were followed, except the 18–55 years group was assigned in a 5:1 ratio to two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or two doses of MenACWY.\n\n Participants and investigators, but not staff administering the vaccine, were masked to vaccine allocation.\n\n The specific objectives of this report were to assess the safety and humoral and cellular immunogenicity of a single-dose and two-dose schedule in adults older than 55 years.\n\n Humoral responses at baseline and after each vaccination until 1 year after the booster were assessed using an in-house standardised ELISA, a multiplex immunoassay, and a live severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) microneutralisation assay (MNA80).\n\n Cellular responses were assessed using an ex-vivo IFN-? enzyme-linked immunospot assay.\n\n The coprimary outcomes of the trial were efficacy, as measured by the number of cases of symptomatic, virologically confirmed COVID-19, and safety, as measured by the occurrence of serious adverse events.\n\n Analyses were by group allocation in participants who received the vaccine.\n\n Here, we report the preliminary findings on safety, reactogenicity, and cellular and humoral immune responses.\n\n This study is ongoing and is registered with ClinicalTrials.\n\ngov, NCT04400838, and ISRCTN, 15281137.\nFindings\nBetween May 30 and Aug 8, 2020, 560 participants were enrolled: 160 aged 18–55 years (100 assigned to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, 60 assigned to MenACWY), 160 aged 56–69 years (120 assigned to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19: 40 assigned to MenACWY), and 240 aged 70 years and older (200 assigned to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19: 40 assigned to MenACWY).\n\n Seven participants did not receive the boost dose of their assigned two-dose regimen, one participant received the incorrect vaccine, and three were excluded from immunogenicity analyses due to incorrectly labelled samples.\n\n 280 (50%) of 552 analysable participants were female.\n\n Local and systemic reactions were more common in participants given ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 than in those given the control vaccine, and similar in nature to those previously reported (injection-site pain, feeling feverish, muscle ache, headache), but were less common in older adults (aged ?56 years) than younger adults.\n\n In those receiving two standard doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, after the prime vaccination local reactions were reported in 43 (88%) of 49 participants in the 18–55 years group, 22 (73%) of 30 in the 56–69 years group, and 30 (61%) of 49 in the 70 years and older group, and systemic reactions in 42 (86%) participants in the 18–55 years group, 23 (77%) in the 56–69 years group, and 32 (65%) in the 70 years and older group.\n\n As of Oct 26, 2020, 13 serious adverse events occurred during the study period, none of which were considered to be related to either study vaccine.\n\n In participants who received two doses of vaccine, median anti-spike SARS-CoV-2 IgG responses 28 days after the boost dose were similar across the three age cohorts (standard-dose groups: 18–55 years, 20?713 arbitrary units [AU]/mL [IQR 13?898–33?550], n=39; 56–69 years, 16?170 AU/mL [10?233–40?353], n=26; and ?70 years 17?561 AU/mL [9705–37?796], n=47; p=0·68).\n\n Neutralising antibody titres after a boost dose were similar across all age groups (median MNA80 at day 42 in the standard-dose groups: 18–55 years, 193 [IQR 113–238], n=39; 56–69 years, 144 [119–347], n=20; and ?70 years, 161 [73–323], n=47; p=0·40).\n\n By 14 days after the boost dose, 208 (&gt;99%) of 209 boosted participants had neutralising antibody responses.\n\n T-cell responses peaked at day 14 after a single standard dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (18–55 years: median 1187 spot-forming cells [SFCs] per million peripheral blood mononuclear cells [IQR 841–2428], n=24; 56–69 years: 797 SFCs [383–1817], n=29; and ?70 years: 977 SFCs [458–1914], n=48).\n\n\nInterpretation\nChAdOx1 nCoV-19 appears to be better tolerated in older adults than in younger adults and has similar immunogenicity across all age groups after a boost dose.\n\n Further assessment of the efficacy of this vaccine is warranted in all age groups and individuals with comorbidities.\n\n\nFunding\nUK Research and Innovation, National

roll-out and COVID-19 hospital admissions in Scotland: a national prospective cohort study","abstract":"Background\nThe BNT162b2 mRNA (Pfizer–BioNTech) and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Oxford–AstraZeneca) COVID-19 vaccines have shown high efficacy against disease in phase 3 clinical trials and are now being used in national vaccination programmes in the UK and several other countries.\n\n Studying the real-world effects of these vaccines is an urgent requirement.\n\n The aim of our study was to investigate the association between the mass roll-out of the first doses of these COVID-19 vaccines and hospital admissions for COVID-19.\nMethods\nWe did a prospective cohort study using the Early Pandemic Evaluation and Enhanced Surveillance of COVID-19—EAVE II—database comprising linked vaccination, primary care, real-time reverse transcription-PCR testing, and hospital admission patient records for 5·4 million people in Scotland (about 99% of the population) registered at 940 general practices.\n\n Individuals who had previously tested positive were excluded from the analysis.\n\n A time-dependent Cox model and Poisson regression models with inverse propensity weights were fitted to estimate effectiveness against COVID-19 hospital admission (defined as 1–adjusted rate ratio) following the first dose of vaccine.\n\n\nFindings\nBetween Dec 8, 2020, and Feb 22, 2021, a total of 1?331?993 people were vaccinated over the study period.\n\n The mean age of those vaccinated was 65·0 years (SD 16·2).\n\n The first dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine was associated with a vaccine effect of 91% (95% CI 85–94) for reduced COVID-19 hospital admission at 28–34 days post-vaccination.\n\n Vaccine effect at the same time interval for the ChAdOx1 vaccine was 88% (95% CI 75–94).\n\n Results of combined vaccine effects against hospital admission due to COVID-19 were similar when restricting the analysis to those aged 80 years and older (83%, 95% CI 72–89 at 28–34 days post-vaccination).\n\n\nInterpretation\nMass roll-out of the first doses of the BNT162b2 mRNA and ChAdOx1 vaccines was associated with substantial reductions in the risk of hospital admission due to COVID-19 in Scotland.\n\n There remains the possibility that some of the observed effects might have been due to residual confounding.\n\n\nFunding\nUK Research and Innovation (Medical Research

We aimed to determine the factors associated with vaccine coverage for both vaccines and documented the vaccine effectiveness of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine in a cohort of health-care workers undergoing regular asymptomatic testing.\n\n\nMethods\nThe SIREN study is a prospective cohort study among staff (aged ?18 years) working in publicly-funded hospitals in the UK.\n\n Participants were assigned into either the positive cohort (antibody positive or history of infection [indicated by previous positivity of antibody or PCR tests]) or the negative cohort (antibody negative with no previous positive test) at the beginning of the follow-up period.\n\n Baseline risk factors were collected at enrolment, symptom status was collected every 2 weeks, and vaccination status was collected through linkage to the National Immunisations Management System and questionnaires.\n\n Participants had fortnightly asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing and monthly antibody testing, and all tests (including symptomatic testing) outside SIREN were captured.\n\n Data cutoff for this analysis was Feb 5, 2021. The follow-up period was Dec 7, 2020, to Feb 5, 2021. The primary outcomes were vaccinated participants (binary ever vacinated variable; indicated by at least one vaccine dose recorded by at least one of the two vaccination data sources) for the vaccine coverage analysis and SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by a PCR test for the vaccine effectiveness analysis.\n\n We did a mixed-effect logistic regression analysis to identify factors associated with vaccine coverage.\n\n We used a piecewise exponential hazard mixed-effects model (shared frailty-type model) using a Poisson distribution to calculate hazard ratios to compare time-to-infection in unvaccinated and vaccinated participants and estimate the impact of the BNT162b2 vaccine on all PCR-positive infections (asymptomatic and symptomatic).\n\n This study is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN11041050, and is ongoing.\n\n\nFindings\n23?324 participants from 104 sites (all in England) met the inclusion criteria for this analysis and were enrolled.\n\n Included participants had a median age of 46·1 years (IQR 36·0–54·1) and 19?692 (84%) were female; 8203 (35%) were assigned to the positive cohort at the start of the analysis period, and 15?121 (65%) assigned to the negative cohort.\n\n Total follow-up time was 2 calendar months and 1?106?905 person-days (396?318 vaccinated and 710?587 unvaccinated).\n\n Vaccine coverage was 89% on Feb 5, 2021, 94% of whom had BNT162b2 vaccine.\n\n Significantly lower coverage was associated with previous infection, gender, age, ethnicity, job role, and Index of Multiple Deprivation score.\n\n During follow-up, there were 977 new infections in the unvaccinated cohort, an incidence density of 14 infections per 10?000 person-days; the vaccinated cohort had 71 new infections 21 days or more after their first dose (incidence density of eight infections per 10?000 person-days) and nine infections 7 days after the second dose (incidence density four infections per 10?000 person-days).\n\n In the unvaccinated cohort, 543 (56%) participants had typical COVID-19 symptoms and 140 (14%) were asymptomatic on or 14 days before their PCR positive test date, compared with 29 (36%) with typical COVID-19 symptoms and 15 (19%) asymptomatic in the vaccinated cohort.\n\n A single dose of BNT162b2 vaccine showed vaccine effectiveness of 70% (95% CI 55–85) 21 days after first dose and 85% (74–96) 7 days after two doses in the study population.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings show that the BNT162b2 vaccine can prevent both symptomatic and asymptomatic infection in working-age adults.\n\n This cohort was vaccinated when the dominant variant in circulation was B1.1.7 and shows effectiveness against this variant.\n\n\nFunding\nPublic Health England, UK Department of Health and Social Care, and the National Institute

of millions of people in a worldwide pandemic.\n\n Safe and effective vaccines are needed urgently.\n\n\nMethods\nIn an ongoing multinational, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded, pivotal efficacy trial, we randomly assigned persons 16 years of age or older in a 1:1 ratio to receive two doses, 21 days apart, of either placebo or the BNT162b2 vaccine candidate (30 ?g per dose).\n\n BNT162b2 is a lipid nanoparticle–formulated, nucleoside-modified RNA vaccine that encodes a prefusion stabilized, membrane-anchored SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike protein.\n\n The primary end points were efficacy of the vaccine against laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 and safety.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 43,548 participants underwent randomization, of whom 43,448 received injections: 21,720 with BNT162b2 and 21,728 with placebo.\n\n There were 8 cases of Covid-19 with onset at least 7 days after the second dose among participants assigned to receive BNT162b2 and 162 cases among those assigned to placebo; BNT162b2 was 95% effective in preventing Covid-19 (95% credible interval, 90.3 to 97.6).\n\n Similar vaccine efficacy (generally 90 to 100%) was observed across subgroups defined by age, sex, race, ethnicity, baseline body-mass index, and the presence of coexisting conditions.\n\n Among 10 cases of severe Covid-19 with onset after the first dose, 9 occurred in placebo recipients and 1 in a BNT162b2 recipient.\n\n The safety profile of BNT162b2 was characterized by short-term, mild-to-moderate pain at the injection site, fatigue, and headache.\n\n The incidence of serious adverse events was low and was similar in the vaccine and placebo groups.\n\n\nConclusions\nA two-dose regimen of BNT162b2 conferred 95% protection against Covid-19 in persons 16 years of age or older.\n\n Safety over a median of 2 months was similar to that of other viral vaccines.\n\n (Funded by BioNTech and Pfizer; ClinicalTrials.\n\ngov number,

sustained immune responses to Ebola Zaire could support a preventive strategy for future outbreaks","abstract":"The consequences of the 2013–16 Ebola Zaire virus disease epidemic in West Africa were grave.\n The economies, healthcare systems and communities of Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia were devastated by over 18 months of active Ebola virus transmission, followed by sporadic resurgences potentially related to sexual transmission by survivors with viral persistence in body fluids following recovery.\n The need to develop and implement strategies to prevent and mitigate future outbreaks is now beyond dispute.\n The potential for unpredictable outbreaks of indeterminate duration, and control challenges posed by the possibility of sporadic re-emergence, mean that implementation of an effective vaccination program for outbreak containment necessitates a vaccine providing durable immunity.\n Heterologous prime-boost vaccine regimens deliver the same or similar antigens through different vaccine types, the first to prime and the second to boost the immune system.\n Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN-Filo is an investigational Ebola Zaire vaccine regimen that uses this heterologous prime-boost approach.\n Preliminary Phase 1 data suggest that Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN-Filo confers durable immunity for at least 240 d and is well-tolerated with a good safety profile.\n This regimen may therefore be suitable for prophylactic use in a regional or targeted population vaccination strategy, and could potentially aid prevention and control of future Ebola outbreaks.\n","id":"PMC5328205","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Taylor &amp;

In the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group, spike-specific T-cell responses peaked on day 14 (median 856 spot-forming cells per million peripheral blood mononuclear cells, IQR 493–1802; n=43).\n\n Anti-spike IgG responses rose by day 28 (median 157 ELISA units [EU], 96–317; n=127), and were boosted following a second dose (639 EU, 360–792; n=10).\n\n Neutralising antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 32 (91%) of 35 participants after a single dose when measured in MNA80 and in 35 (100%) participants when measured in PRNT50.\n\n After a booster dose, all participants had neutralising activity (nine of nine in MNA80 at day 42 and ten of ten in Marburg VN on day 56).\n\n Neutralising antibody responses correlated strongly with antibody levels measured by ELISA (R2=0·67 by Marburg VN; p&lt;0·001).\n\n\nInterpretation\nChAdOx1 nCoV-19 showed an acceptable safety profile, and homologous boosting increased antibody responses.\n\n These results, together with the induction of both humoral and cellular immune responses, support large-scale evaluation of this candidate vaccine in an ongoing phase 3 programme.\n\n\nFunding\nUK Research and Innovation, Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, Thames Valley and South Midland's NIHR Clinical Research Network, and the German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), Partner site Gießen-Marburg-Langen.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7445431","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"The Author(s).

and immunogenicity of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine administered in a prime-boost regimen in young and old adults (COV002): a single-blind, randomised, controlled, phase 2/3 trial","abstract":"Background\nOlder adults (aged ?70 years) are at increased risk of severe disease and death if they develop COVID-19 and are therefore a priority for immunisation should an efficacious vaccine be developed.\n\n Immunogenicity of vaccines is often worse in older adults as a result of immunosenescence.\n\n We have reported the immunogenicity of a novel chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222), in young adults, and now describe the safety and immunogenicity of this vaccine in a wider range of participants, including adults aged 70 years and older.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this report of the phase 2 component of a single-blind, randomised, controlled, phase 2/3 trial (COV002), healthy adults aged 18 years and older were enrolled at two UK clinical research facilities, in an age-escalation manner, into 18–55 years, 56–69 years, and 70 years and older immunogenicity subgroups.\n\n Participants were eligible if they did not have severe or uncontrolled medical comorbidities or a high frailty score (if aged ?65 years).\n\n First, participants were recruited to a low-dose cohort, and within each age group, participants were randomly assigned to receive either intramuscular ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (2·2?×?1010 virus particles) or a control vaccine, MenACWY, using block randomisation and stratified by age and dose group and study site, using the following ratios: in the 18–55 years group, 1:1 to either two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or two doses of MenACWY; in the 56–69 years group, 3:1:3:1 to one dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, one dose of MenACWY, two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, or two doses of MenACWY; and in the 70 years and older, 5:1:5:1 to one dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, one dose of MenACWY, two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, or two doses of MenACWY.\n\n Prime-booster regimens were given 28 days apart.\n\n Participants were then recruited to the standard-dose cohort (3·5–6·5?×?1010 virus particles of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) and the same randomisation procedures were followed, except the 18–55 years group was assigned in a 5:1 ratio to two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or two doses of MenACWY.\n\n Participants and investigators, but not staff administering the vaccine, were masked to vaccine allocation.\n\n The specific objectives of this report were to assess the safety and humoral and cellular immunogenicity of a single-dose and two-dose schedule in adults older than 55 years.\n\n Humoral responses at baseline and after each vaccination until 1 year after the booster were assessed using an in-house standardised ELISA, a multiplex immunoassay, and a live severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) microneutralisation assay (MNA80).\n\n Cellular responses were assessed using an ex-vivo IFN-? enzyme-linked immunospot assay.\n\n The coprimary outcomes of the trial were efficacy, as measured by the number of cases of symptomatic, virologically confirmed COVID-19, and safety, as measured by the occurrence of serious adverse events.\n\n Analyses were by group allocation in participants who received the vaccine.\n\n Here, we report the preliminary findings on safety, reactogenicity, and cellular and humoral immune responses.\n\n This study is ongoing and is registered with ClinicalTrials.\n\ngov, NCT04400838, and ISRCTN, 15281137.\nFindings\nBetween May 30 and Aug 8, 2020, 560 participants were enrolled: 160 aged 18–55 years (100 assigned to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, 60 assigned to MenACWY), 160 aged 56–69 years (120 assigned to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19: 40 assigned to MenACWY), and 240 aged 70 years and older (200 assigned to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19: 40 assigned to MenACWY).\n\n Seven participants did not receive the boost dose of their assigned two-dose regimen, one participant received the incorrect vaccine, and three were excluded from immunogenicity analyses due to incorrectly labelled samples.\n\n 280 (50%) of 552 analysable participants were female.\n\n Local and systemic reactions were more common in participants given ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 than in those given the control vaccine, and similar in nature to those previously reported (injection-site pain, feeling feverish, muscle ache, headache), but were less common in older adults (aged ?56 years) than younger adults.\n\n In those receiving two standard doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, after the prime vaccination local reactions were reported in 43 (88%) of 49 participants in the 18–55 years group, 22 (73%) of 30 in the 56–69 years group, and 30 (61%) of 49 in the 70 years and older group, and systemic reactions in 42 (86%) participants in the 18–55 years group, 23 (77%) in the 56–69 years group, and 32 (65%) in the 70 years and older group.\n\n As of Oct 26, 2020, 13 serious adverse events occurred during the study period, none of which were considered to be related to either study vaccine.\n\n In participants who received two doses of vaccine, median anti-spike SARS-CoV-2 IgG responses 28 days after the boost dose were similar across the three age cohorts (standard-dose groups: 18–55 years, 20?713 arbitrary units [AU]/mL [IQR 13?898–33?550], n=39; 56–69 years, 16?170 AU/mL [10?233–40?353], n=26; and ?70 years 17?561 AU/mL [9705–37?796], n=47; p=0·68).\n\n Neutralising antibody titres after a boost dose were similar across all age groups (median MNA80 at day 42 in the standard-dose groups: 18–55 years, 193 [IQR 113–238], n=39; 56–69 years, 144 [119–347], n=20; and ?70 years, 161 [73–323], n=47; p=0·40).\n\n By 14 days after the boost dose, 208 (&gt;99%) of 209 boosted participants had neutralising antibody responses.\n\n T-cell responses peaked at day 14 after a single standard dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (18–55 years: median 1187 spot-forming cells [SFCs] per million peripheral blood mononuclear cells [IQR 841–2428], n=24; 56–69 years: 797 SFCs [383–1817], n=29; and ?70 years: 977 SFCs [458–1914], n=48).\n\n\nInterpretation\nChAdOx1 nCoV-19 appears to be better tolerated in older adults than in younger adults and has similar immunogenicity across all age groups after a boost dose.\n\n Further assessment of the efficacy of this vaccine is warranted in all age groups and individuals with comorbidities.\n\n\nFunding\nUK Research and Innovation, National Institutes for Health Research (NIHR), Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, NIHR Oxford Biomedical

We aimed to determine the factors associated with vaccine coverage for both vaccines and documented the vaccine effectiveness of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine in a cohort of health-care workers undergoing regular asymptomatic testing.\n\n\nMethods\nThe SIREN study is a prospective cohort study among staff (aged ?18 years) working in publicly-funded hospitals in the UK.\n\n Participants were assigned into either the positive cohort (antibody positive or history of infection [indicated by previous positivity of antibody or PCR tests]) or the negative cohort (antibody negative with no previous positive test) at the beginning of the follow-up period.\n\n Baseline risk factors were collected at enrolment, symptom status was collected every 2 weeks, and vaccination status was collected through linkage to the National Immunisations Management System and questionnaires.\n\n Participants had fortnightly asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing and monthly antibody testing, and all tests (including symptomatic testing) outside SIREN were captured.\n\n Data cutoff for this analysis was Feb 5, 2021. The follow-up period was Dec 7, 2020, to Feb 5, 2021. The primary outcomes were vaccinated participants (binary ever vacinated variable; indicated by at least one vaccine dose recorded by at least one of the two vaccination data sources) for the vaccine coverage analysis and SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by a PCR test for the vaccine effectiveness analysis.\n\n We did a mixed-effect logistic regression analysis to identify factors associated with vaccine coverage.\n\n We used a piecewise exponential hazard mixed-effects model (shared frailty-type model) using a Poisson distribution to calculate hazard ratios to compare time-to-infection in unvaccinated and vaccinated participants and estimate the impact of the BNT162b2 vaccine on all PCR-positive infections (asymptomatic and symptomatic).\n\n This study is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN11041050, and is ongoing.\n\n\nFindings\n23?324 participants from 104 sites (all in England) met the inclusion criteria for this analysis and were enrolled.\n\n Included participants had a median age of 46·1 years (IQR 36·0–54·1) and 19?692 (84%) were female; 8203 (35%) were assigned to the positive cohort at the start of the analysis period, and 15?121 (65%) assigned to the negative cohort.\n\n Total follow-up time was 2 calendar months and 1?106?905 person-days (396?318 vaccinated and 710?587 unvaccinated).\n\n Vaccine coverage was 89% on Feb 5, 2021, 94% of whom had BNT162b2 vaccine.\n\n Significantly lower coverage was associated with previous infection, gender, age, ethnicity, job role, and Index of Multiple Deprivation score.\n\n During follow-up, there were 977 new infections in the unvaccinated cohort, an incidence density of 14 infections per 10?000 person-days; the vaccinated cohort had 71 new infections 21 days or more after their first dose (incidence density of eight infections per 10?000 person-days) and nine infections 7 days after the second dose (incidence density four infections per 10?000 person-days).\n\n In the unvaccinated cohort, 543 (56%) participants had typical COVID-19 symptoms and 140 (14%) were asymptomatic on or 14 days before their PCR positive test date, compared with 29 (36%) with typical COVID-19 symptoms and 15 (19%) asymptomatic in the vaccinated cohort.\n\n A single dose of BNT162b2 vaccine showed vaccine effectiveness of 70% (95% CI 55–85) 21 days after first dose and 85% (74–96) 7 days after two doses in the study population.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings show that the BNT162b2 vaccine can prevent both symptomatic and asymptomatic infection in working-age adults.\n\n This cohort was vaccinated when the dominant variant in circulation was B1.1.7 and shows effectiveness against this variant.\n\n\nFunding\nPublic Health England, UK Department of Health and Social Care, and the National Institute for Health Research.\n\n\n","id":"PMC8064668","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Published by Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Victoria

against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) commence worldwide, vaccine effectiveness needs to be assessed for a range of outcomes across diverse populations in a noncontrolled setting.\n\n In this study, data from Israel’s largest health care organization were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine.\n\n\nMethods\nAll persons who were newly vaccinated during the period from December 20, 2020, to February 1, 2021, were matched to unvaccinated controls in a 1:1 ratio according to demographic and clinical characteristics.\n\n Study outcomes included documented infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), symptomatic Covid-19, Covid-19–related hospitalization, severe illness, and death.\n\n We estimated vaccine effectiveness for each outcome as one minus the risk ratio, using the Kaplan–Meier estimator.\n\n\nResults\nEach study group included 596,618 persons.\n\n Estimated vaccine effectiveness for the study outcomes at days 14 through 20 after the first dose and at 7 or more days after the second dose was as follows: for documented infection, 46% (95% confidence interval [CI], 40 to 51) and 92% (95% CI, 88 to 95); for symptomatic Covid-19, 57% (95% CI, 50 to 63) and 94% (95% CI, 87 to 98); for hospitalization, 74% (95% CI, 56 to 86) and 87% (95% CI, 55 to 100); and for severe disease, 62% (95% CI, 39 to 80) and 92% (95% CI, 75 to 100), respectively.\n\n Estimated effectiveness in preventing death from Covid-19 was 72% (95% CI, 19 to 100) for days 14 through 20 after the first dose.\n\n Estimated effectiveness in specific subpopulations assessed for documented infection and symptomatic Covid-19 was consistent across age groups, with potentially slightly lower effectiveness in persons with multiple coexisting conditions.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis study in a nationwide mass vaccination setting suggests that the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine is effective for a wide range of Covid-19–related outcomes, a finding consistent with that of the randomized trial.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7944975","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical

Vaccine","abstract":"Background\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and the resulting coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) have afflicted tens of millions of people in a worldwide pandemic.\n\n Safe and effective vaccines are needed urgently.\n\n\nMethods\nIn an ongoing multinational, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded, pivotal efficacy trial, we randomly assigned persons 16 years of age or older in a 1:1 ratio to receive two doses, 21 days apart, of either placebo or the BNT162b2 vaccine candidate (30 ?g per dose).\n\n BNT162b2 is a lipid nanoparticle–formulated, nucleoside-modified RNA vaccine that encodes a prefusion stabilized, membrane-anchored SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike protein.\n\n The primary end points were efficacy of the vaccine against laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 and safety.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 43,548 participants underwent randomization, of whom 43,448 received injections: 21,720 with BNT162b2 and 21,728 with placebo.\n\n There were 8 cases of Covid-19 with onset at least 7 days after the second dose among participants assigned to receive BNT162b2 and 162 cases among those assigned to placebo; BNT162b2 was 95% effective in preventing Covid-19 (95% credible interval, 90.3 to 97.6).\n\n Similar vaccine efficacy (generally 90 to 100%) was observed across subgroups defined by age, sex, race, ethnicity, baseline body-mass index, and the presence of coexisting conditions.\n\n Among 10 cases of severe Covid-19 with onset after the first dose, 9 occurred in placebo recipients and 1 in a BNT162b2 recipient.\n\n The safety profile of BNT162b2 was characterized by short-term, mild-to-moderate pain at the injection site, fatigue, and headache.\n\n The incidence of serious adverse events was low and was similar in the vaccine and placebo groups.\n\n\nConclusions\nA two-dose regimen of BNT162b2 conferred 95% protection against Covid-19 in persons 16 years of age or older.\n\n Safety over a median of 2 months was similar to that of other viral vaccines.\n\n (Funded by BioNTech and Pfizer; ClinicalTrials.\n\ngov number,

Moreover, passively administered antibodies are among the most promising therapeutic and prophylactic anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents.\n However, the degree to which SARS-CoV-2 will adapt to evade neutralizing antibodies is unclear.\n Using a recombinant chimeric VSV/SARS-CoV-2 reporter virus, we show that functional SARS-CoV-2 S protein variants with mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and N-terminal domain that confer resistance to monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma can be readily selected.\n Notably, SARS-CoV-2 S variants that resist commonly elicited neutralizing antibodies are now present at low frequencies in circulating SARS-CoV-2 populations.\n Finally, the emergence of antibody-resistant SARS-CoV-2 variants that might limit the therapeutic usefulness of monoclonal

Mapping of Mutations to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Receptor-Binding Domain that Escape Antibody Recognition","abstract":"Antibodies targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) are being developed as therapeutics and are a major contributor to neutralizing antibody responses elicited by infection.\n Here, we describe a deep mutational scanning method to map how all amino-acid mutations in the RBD affect antibody binding and apply this method to 10 human monoclonal antibodies.\n The escape mutations cluster on several surfaces of the RBD that broadly correspond to structurally defined antibody epitopes.\n However, even antibodies targeting the same surface often have distinct escape mutations.\n The complete escape maps predict which mutations are selected during viral growth in the presence of single antibodies.\n They further enable the design of escape-resistant antibody cocktails—including cocktails of antibodies that compete for binding to the same RBD surface but have different escape mutations.\n Therefore, complete escape-mutation maps enable rational design of antibody therapeutics and assessment of the antigenic consequences of viral evolution.\n","id":"PMC7676316","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Cell Press","authors":[{"firstname":"Allison

The ARTIC primer set amplifies 98 amplicons, which are separated only in two PCRs, across a nearly entire viral genome.\n The original primer set and protocol showed a fairly small amplification bias

show that dimer formations between some primers are the major cause of coverage bias in the multiplex PCR.\n Based on this, we propose 12 alternative primers in total in the ARTIC primer set that were predicted to be involved in 14 primer interactions.\n The resulting primer set, version N1 (NIID-1), exhibits improved overall coverage compared to the ARTIC Network’s original (V1) and modified (V3)

efficient tool is required to remove primer sequences from short reads to ensure the reliability of downstream analysis.\n\n Although some tools are currently available, their efficiency and accuracy require improvement in trimming large scale of primers in high throughput target genome sequencing.\n\n This issue is becoming more urgent considering the potential clinical implementation of MAS for processing patient samples.\n\n We here developed pTrimmer that could handle thousands of primers simultaneously with greatly improved accuracy and performance.\n\n\nResult\nid='Par2'>pTrimmer combines the two algorithms of k-mers and Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, which ensures its accuracy even with the presence of sequencing errors.\n\n pTrimmer has an improvement of 28.59% sensitivity and 11.87% accuracy compared to the similar tools.\n\n The simulation showed pTrimmer has an ultra-high sensitivity rate of 99.96% and accuracy of 97.38% compared to cutPrimers (70.85% sensitivity rate and 58.73% accuracy).\n\n And the performance of pTrimmer is notably higher.\n\n It is about 370 times faster than cutPrimers and even 17,000 times faster than cutadapt per threads.\n\n Trimming 2158 pairs of primers from 11 million reads (Illumina PE 150?bp) takes only 37?s and no more than 100?MB of memory consumption.\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par3'>pTrimmer is designed to trim primer sequence from

Health Service in England.\n\n Influenza vaccination is an effective measure to prevent severe disease, hence, maximising vaccine coverage in the most vulnerable is a priority.\n\n We aimed to identify the extent to which socioeconomic status is associated with influenza-associated illness (IAI) and influenza vaccine coverage.\n\n\nDesign\nRetrospective observational study using hospital episode statistics.\n\n\nSetting\nMerseyside, North-West of England, including the city of Liverpool.\n\n\nParticipants\nResidents of Merseyside hospitalised with IAI between April 2004 and March 2016, and Merseyside general practice registered patients eligible for influenza vaccination in 2014/2015 and 2015/2016 influenza seasons.\n\n\nExposures\nSocioeconomic deprivation based on lower super output area English Indices of Deprivation scores.\n\n\nPrimary and secondary outcome measures\nIncidence and risk of IAI hospitalisation, and vaccine uptake.\n\n\nResults\nThere were 89?058 hospitalisations related to IAI among Merseyside residents (mean yearly rate=4.9 per 1000 population).\n\n Hospitalisations for IAI were more frequent in the most socioeconomically deprived areas compared with the least deprived in adults aged 15–39 years (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 2.08;95%?CI 1.76 to 2.45; p&lt;0.001), 60–64 years (IRR 2.65; 95%?CI 2.35 to 2.99; p&lt;0.001) and 65+ years (IRR 1.90; 95%?CI 1.73 to 2.10; p&lt;0.001), whereas rates in children were more homogeneous across deprivation strata.\n\n Vaccine uptake was lower than the nationally set targets in most neighbourhoods.\n\n The odds of vaccine uptake were 30% lower (OR 0.70; 95%?CI 0.66 to 0.74; p&lt;0.001) and 10% lower (OR 0.90; 95%?CI 0.88 to 0.92; p&lt;0.001) in the most socioeconomically deprived quintile compared with the least deprived, among children aged 24–59 months and 65+ years, respectively.\n\n\nConclusions\nHigher rates of IAI hospitalisations and lower vaccine uptake in the most socioeconomically deprived populations suggest that health promotion policies and interventions that target these populations should be a priority.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6303586","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BMJ Publishing

This analysis shows that isolation and contact tracing reduce the time during which cases are infectious in the community, thereby reducing the R.\n\n The overall impact of isolation and contact tracing, however, is uncertain and highly dependent on the number of asymptomatic cases.\n\n Moreover, children are at a similar risk of infection to the general population, although less likely to have severe symptoms; hence they should be considered in analyses of transmission and control.\n\n\nFunding\nEmergency Response Program of Harbin Institute of Technology, Emergency Response Program of

progression and UTI/sepsis hospitalization was highest within 90?days from pneumonia but remained elevated thereafter.\n\n For AKI, the association with incident pneumonia was only seen within 90?days.\n\n Neither cataract nor knee/joint replacement was related to pneumonia.\n\n\nConclusions\nIncident pneumonia was associated with increased risks of MACE, CKD progression, severe UTI/sepsis and death, with risks highest soon after pneumonia diagnosis but extending beyond 90?days.\n\n Our findings highlight the susceptibility for adverse outcomes of CKD patients following pneumonia diagnosis, and may inform clinical decisions regarding vaccination strategies.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7643674","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Oxford University

2019 (Covid-19) has not been well studied.\n\n\nMethods\nWe carried out a population-based case–control study in the Lombardy region of Italy.\n\n A total of 6272 case patients in whom infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was confirmed between February 21 and March 11, 2020, were matched to 30,759 beneficiaries of the Regional Health Service (controls) according to sex, age, and municipality of residence.\n\n Information about the use of selected drugs and patients’ clinical profiles was obtained from regional databases of health care use.\n\n Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for associations between drugs and infection, with adjustment for confounders, were estimated by means of logistic regression.\n\n\nResults\nAmong both case patients and controls, the mean (±SD) age was 68±13 years, and 37% were women.\n\n The use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs was more common among case patients than among controls, as was the use of other antihypertensive and non-antihypertensive drugs, and case patients had a worse clinical profile.\n\n Use of ARBs or ACE inhibitors did not show any association with Covid-19 among case patients overall (adjusted odds ratio, 0.95 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.86 to 1.05] for ARBs and 0.96 [95% CI, 0.87 to 1.07] for ACE inhibitors) or among patients who had a severe or fatal course of the disease (adjusted odds ratio, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.63 to 1.10] for ARBs and 0.91 [95% CI, 0.69 to 1.21] for ACE inhibitors), and no association between these variables was found according to sex.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn this large, population-based study, the use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs was more frequent among patients with Covid-19 than among controls because of their higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease.\n\n However, there was no evidence that ACE inhibitors or ARBs affected the risk of COVID-19.\n","id":"PMC7206933","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical

patients exposed to coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), because the viral receptor is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).\n\n\nMethods\nWe assessed the relation between previous treatment with ACE inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, or thiazide diuretics and the likelihood of a positive or negative result on Covid-19 testing as well as the likelihood of severe illness (defined as intensive care, mechanical ventilation, or death) among patients who tested positive.\n\n Using Bayesian methods, we compared outcomes in patients who had been treated with these medications and in untreated patients, overall and in those with hypertension, after propensity-score matching for receipt of each medication class.\n\n A difference of at least 10 percentage points was prespecified as a substantial difference.\n\n\nResults\nAmong 12,594 patients who were tested for Covid-19, a total of 5894 (46.8%) were positive; 1002 of these patients (17.0%) had severe illness.\n\n A history of hypertension was present in 4357 patients (34.6%), among whom 2573 (59.1%) had a positive test; 634 of these patients (24.6%) had severe illness.\n\n There was no

2,026,227 United States Veterans Aged 54–75 Years","abstract":"Importance:\nid='P2'>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection causes coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), an evolving pandemic.\n\n Limited data are available characterizing SARS-Cov-2 infection in the United States.\n\n\nObjective:\nid='P3'>To determine associations between demographic and clinical factors and testing positive for coronavirus 2019 (Covid-19+), and among Covid-19+ subsequent hospitalization and intensive care.\n\n\nDesign, Setting, and Participants:\nid='P4'>Retrospective cohort study including all patients tested for Covid-19 between February 8 and March 30, 2020, inclusive.\n\n We extracted electronic health record data from the national Veterans Affairs Healthcare System, the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States, on 2,026,227 patients born between 1945 and 1965 and active in care.\n\n\nExposures:\nid='P5'>Demographic data, comorbidities, medication history, substance use, vital signs, and laboratory measures.\n\n Laboratory tests were analyzed first individually and then grouped into a validated summary measure of physiologic injury (VACS Index).\n\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures:\nid='P6'>We evaluated which factors were associated with Covid-19+ among all who tested.\n\n Among Covid-19+ we identified factors associated with hospitalization or intensive care.\n\n We identified independent associations using multivariable and conditional multivariable logistic regression with multiple imputation of missing values.\n\n\nResults:\nid='P7'>Among Veterans aged 54–75 years, 585/3,789 (15.4%) tested Covid-19+.\n\n In adjusted analysis (C-statistic=0.806) black race was associated with Covid-19+ (OR 4.68, 95% Cl 3.795.78) and the association remained in analyses conditional on site (OR 2.56, 95% Cl 1.89–3.46).\n\n In adjusted models, laboratory abnormalities (especially fibrosis-4 score [FIB-4] &gt;3.25 OR 8.73, 95% Cl 4.11–18.56), and VACS Index (per 5-point increase OR 1.62, 95% Cl 1.43–1.84) were strongly associated with hospitalization.\n\n Associations were similar for intensive care.\n\n Although significant in unadjusted analyses, associations with comorbid conditions and medications were substantially reduced and, in most cases, no longer significant after adjustment.\n\n\nConclusions and Relevance:\nid='P8'>Black race was strongly associated with Covid-19+, but not with hospitalization or intensive care.\n\n Among Covid-19+, risk of hospitalization and intensive care may be better characterized by laboratory measures and vital signs than by comorbid conditions or prior medication exposure.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7276022","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Cold Spring

short, frailty screening instruments to identify frailty in a large University Hospital ED.\n Consecutive patients aged ?70 attending ED were screened using the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS),

The median CFS score was 4/9 (±2), ISAR 3/6 (±2), and PRISMA-7 was 3/7 (±3).\n Based upon the CGA, 58% were frail and the most accurate instrument for separating frail from non-frail was the PRISMA-7 (AUC 0.88; 95% CI:0.83–0.93) followed by the CFS (AUC 0.83; 95% CI:0.77–0.88), and the ISAR (AUC 0.78; 95% CI:0.71–0.84).\n The PRISMA-7 was statistically significantly more accurate than the ISAR (p

One hundred fifty patients participated in this study.\n\n PRISMA-7 and the CSHA Clinical Frailty Scale were applied to these patients along with a questionnaire on socio-demographics.\n\n No translations were available for the PRISMA-7 or the CSHA in Turkish language.\n\n The PRISMA-7 and the CSHA Clinical Frailty Scale were translated by two translators to Turkish language; after compilation and agreeing to one Turkish translation, the text was translated back by two translators to English.\n\n The translation was then compiled to one text and compared with the original text.\n\n After agreement on the translation, both translations were piloted in 10 elderly people.\n\n The final form has been applied in this study.\n\n Data of the ten piloted patients have not been included into the dataset.\n\n Data were analyzed by IBM-SPSS version 22, using descriptive statistics, Pearson product-moment correlation, and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis.\n\n The level of significance was set at 0.05.\nResults\nOur study showed that participants were in average vulnerability to frailty.\n\n The test-retest reliability score for the PRISMA-7 Scale and for the CSHA Clinical Frailty Scale were (r= 99.2; p&lt;0.001) and (r=97.5; p&lt;0.05), respectively.\n\n After using CSHA Clinical Frailty Scale as a reference standard, PRISMA-7 showed that the area under ROC curve (AUC) was 0.903; which is the best accuracy; and medium level for internal consistency (Cronbach’s ? =0.714) as a measure for reliability.\n\n A cut-off point of 4 or higher for PRISMA-7revealed high sensitivity (81.5%) and specificity (88.2%) for frailty.\n\n\nConclusion\nWe would recommend PRISMA-7 as a reliable and valid instrument, with high-level accuracy in the screening process of frailty.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6140991","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Electronic physician","authors":[{"firstname":"Hakan","surname":"Yaman","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zeynep","surname":"Ünal","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1007/s00391-017-1295-2","date":"1970-01-01","title":"German translation, cross-cultural adaptation and diagnostic test accuracy of three frailty screening tools : PRISMA-7, FRAIL scale and Groningen Frailty Indicator","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1590/0102-311X00072015","date":"1970-01-01","title":"[Cross-cultural adaptation of the PRISMA-7 instrument for use in Brazil: evaluation of conceptual, item, and semantic equivalences]","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1177/1403494811401482","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The Danish national patient register","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1177/1403494810394718","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The Danish National health service register","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1177/1403494811399958","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The Danish register of causes of death","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.2147/CLEP.S41905","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Registration of acute medical hospital admissions in the Danish National Patient Registry: a validation study","abstract":"Background\nIn recent years, the number of acute hospital admissions has increased and this has imposed both organizational and financial strains on the health care system.\n\n Consequently, it is of crucial importance that we have valid data on admission types in the administrative databases in order to provide data for health care planning and research.\n\n\nObjective\nTo examine the validity of registration of acute admissions among medical patients in the Danish National Patient Registry (DNPR) using medical record reviews as the reference standard.\n\n\nMethods\nWe used the nationwide DNPR to identify a sample of 160 medical patients admitted to a hospital in the North Denmark Region during 2009.

the rates of use of hospital services and mortality in the year following the enrolment have been retrieved by the regional database.\n\n Univariable and multivariable analyses addressed the association of health status, social and economic variables with health outcomes.\n\n\nResults\nOne thousand two hundred and eighty persons were recruited; 52 deaths were reported at 1 year of follow-up (robust 1.8%, frail 10.1% and very frail 19.1%, P &lt; 0.001).\n\n The mean rate of use of hospital services was 692.2 per 1000 observation/year (robust 589.5, frail 1191.1 and very frail 848.4, P &lt;

COVID-19 infection hotspots in England using large-scale self-reported data from a mobile application: a prospective, observational study","abstract":"Background\nAs many countries seek to slow the spread of COVID-19 without reimposing national restrictions, it has become important to track the disease at a local level to identify areas in need of targeted intervention.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this prospective, observational study, we did modelling using longitudinal, self-reported data from users of the COVID Symptom Study app in England between March 24, and Sept 29, 2020. Beginning on April 28, in England, the Department of Health and Social Care allocated RT-PCR tests for COVID-19 to app users who logged themselves as healthy at least once in 9 days and then reported any symptom.\n\n We calculated incidence of COVID-19 using the invited swab (RT-PCR) tests reported in the app, and we estimated prevalence using a symptom-based method (using logistic regression) and a method based on both symptoms and swab test results.\n\n We used incidence rates to estimate the effective reproduction number, R(t), modelling the system as a Poisson process and using Markov Chain Monte-Carlo.\n\n We used three datasets to validate our models: the Office for National Statistics (ONS) Community Infection Survey, the Real-time Assessment of Community Transmission (REACT-1) study, and UK Government testing data.\n\n We used geographically granular estimates to highlight regions with rapidly increasing case numbers, or hotspots.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom March 24 to Sept 29, 2020, a total of 2?873?726 users living in England signed up to use the app, of whom 2?842?732 (98·9%) provided valid age information and daily assessments.\n\n These users provided a total of 120?192?306 daily reports of their symptoms, and recorded the results of 169?682 invited swab tests.\n\n On a national level, our estimates of incidence and prevalence showed a similar sensitivity to changes to those reported in the ONS and REACT-1 studies.\n\n On Sept 28, 2020, we estimated an incidence of 15?841 (95% CI 14?023–17?885) daily cases, a prevalence of 0·53% (0·45–0·60), and R(t) of 1·17 (1·15–1·19) in England.\n\n On a geographically granular level, on Sept 28, 2020, we detected 15 (75%) of the 20 regions with highest incidence according to government test data.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur method could help to detect rapid case increases in regions where government testing provision is lower.\n\n Self-reported data from mobile applications can provide an agile resource to inform policy makers during a quickly moving pandemic, serving as a complementary resource to more traditional instruments for disease surveillance.\n\n\nFunding\nZoe Global, UK Government Department of Health and Social Care, Wellcome Trust, UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, UK National Institute for Health Research, UK Medical Research Council and British Heart Foundation, Alzheimer's Society, Chronic Disease Research Foundation.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7785969","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"The Author(s).

Metformin has sex specific immunomodulatory effects which may elucidate treatment mechanisms in COVID-19.\nObjective:\nid='P3'>We sought to identify whether metformin reduced mortality from Covid19 and if sex specific interactions exist.\n\n\nDesign:\nid='P4'>Retrospective review of de-identified claims from UnitedHealth Group’s Clinical Discovery Database.\n\n Unadjusted and multivariate models were conducted to assess risk of mortality based on metformin and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF?) inhibitors as home medications in individuals with T2DM and obesity, controlling for comorbidities, medications, demographics, and state.\n\n Heterogeneity of effect was assessed by sex.\n\n\nSetting:\nid='P5'>The database includes all 50 states in the United States.\n\n\nParticipants:\nid='P6'>Persons with at least 6 months of continuous coverage from UnitedHealth Group in 2019 who were hospitalized with Covid-19. Persons in the metformin group had &gt; 90 days of metformin claims in the 12 months before hospitalization.\n\n\nResults:\nid='P7'>6,256 persons were included; 52.8% female; mean age 75 years.\n\n Metformin was associated with decreased mortality in women by logistic regression, OR 0.792 (0.640, 0.979); mixed effects OR 0.780 (0.631, 0.965); Cox proportional-hazards: HR 0.785 (0.650, 0.951); and propensity matching, OR of 0.759 (0.601, 0.960).\n\n There was no significant reduction in mortality among men.\n\n TNF? inhibitors were associated with decreased mortality, by propensity matching in a limited model, OR 0.19 (0.0378, 0.983).\n\n\nConclusions:\nid='P8'>Metformin was significantly associated with reduced mortality in women with obesity or T2DM in observational analyses of claims data from individuals hospitalized with Covid-19. This sex-specific finding is consistent with metformin’s reduction of TNF? in females over males, and suggests that metformin conveys protection in Covid-19 through TNF? effects.\n\n Prospective

racial and ethnic differences in outcomes from Covid-19.\nMethods\nIn this retrospective cohort study, we analyzed data from patients seen within an integrated-delivery health system (Ochsner Health) in Louisiana between March 1 and April 11, 2020, who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19) on qualitative polymerase-chain-reaction assay.\n\n The Ochsner Health population is 31% black non-Hispanic and 65% white non-Hispanic.\n\n The primary outcomes were hospitalization and in-hospital death.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 3626 patients tested positive, of whom 145 were excluded (84 had missing data on race or ethnic group, 9 were Hispanic, and 52 were Asian or of another race or ethnic group).\n\n Of the 3481 Covid-19–positive patients included in our analyses, 60.0% were female, 70.4% were black non-Hispanic, and 29.6% were white non-Hispanic.\n\n Black patients had higher prevalences of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease than white patients.\n\n A total of 39.7% of Covid-19–positive patients (1382 patients) were hospitalized, 76.9% of whom were black.\n\n In multivariable analyses, black race, increasing age, a higher score on the Charlson Comorbidity Index (indicating a greater burden of illness), public insurance (Medicare or Medicaid), residence in a low-income area, and obesity were associated with increased odds of hospital admission.\n\n Among the 326 patients who died from Covid-19, 70.6% were black.\n\n In adjusted time-to-event analyses, variables that were associated with higher in-hospital mortality were increasing age and presentation with an elevated respiratory rate; elevated levels of venous lactate, creatinine, or procalcitonin; or low platelet or lymphocyte counts.\n\n However, black race was not independently associated with higher mortality (hazard ratio for death vs.\n\n white race, 0.89; 95% confidence interval, 0.68 to 1.17).\n\n\nConclusions\nIn a large cohort in Louisiana, 76.9% of the patients who were hospitalized with Covid-19 and 70.6% of those who died were black, whereas blacks comprise only 31% of the Ochsner Health population.\n\n Black race was not associated with higher in-hospital mortality than white race, after adjustment for differences in sociodemographic and

of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in Geneva, Switzerland (SEROCoV-POP): a population-based study","abstract":"Background\nAssessing the burden of COVID-19 on the basis of medically attended case numbers is suboptimal given its reliance on testing strategy, changing case definitions, and disease presentation.\n\n Population-based serosurveys measuring anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (anti-SARS-CoV-2) antibodies provide one method for estimating infection rates and monitoring the progression of the epidemic.\n\n Here, we estimate weekly seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the population of Geneva, Switzerland, during the epidemic.\n\n\nMethods\nThe SEROCoV-POP study is a population-based study of former participants of the Bus Santé study and their household members.\n\n We planned a series of 12 consecutive weekly serosurveys among randomly selected participants from a previous population-representative survey, and their household members aged 5 years and older.\n\n We tested each participant for anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies using a commercially available ELISA.\n\n We estimated seroprevalence using a Bayesian logistic regression model taking into account test performance and adjusting for the age and sex of Geneva's population.\n\n Here we present results from the first 5 weeks of the study.\n\n\nFindings\nBetween April 6 and May 9, 2020, we enrolled 2766 participants from 1339 households, with a demographic distribution similar to that of the canton of Geneva.\n\n In the first week, we estimated a seroprevalence of 4·8% (95% CI 2·4–8·0, n=341).\n\n The estimate increased to 8·5% (5·9–11·4, n=469) in the second week, to 10·9% (7·9–14·4, n=577) in the third week, 6·6% (4·3–9·4, n=604) in the fourth week, and 10·8% (8·2–13·9, n=775) in the fifth week.\n\n Individuals aged 5–9 years (relative risk [RR] 0·32 [95% CI 0·11–0·63]) and those older than 65 years (RR 0·50 [0·28–0·78]) had a significantly lower risk of being seropositive than those aged 20–49 years.\n\n After accounting for the time to seroconversion, we estimated that for every reported confirmed case, there were 11·6 infections in the community.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThese results suggest that most of the population of Geneva remained uninfected during this wave of the pandemic, despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 in the region (5000 reported clinical cases over &lt;2·5 months in the population of half a million people).\n\n Assuming that the presence of IgG antibodies is associated with immunity, these results highlight that the epidemic is far from coming to an end by means of fewer susceptible people in the population.\n\n Further, a significantly lower seroprevalence was observed for children aged 5–9 years and adults older than 65 years, compared with those aged 10–64 years.\n\n These results will inform countries considering the easing of restrictions aimed at curbing transmission.\n\n\nFunding\nSwiss Federal Office of Public Health, Swiss School of Public Health (Corona Immunitas research program), Fondation de Bienfaisance du Groupe Pictet, Fondation Ancrage,

thrombocytopenic, thromboembolic and hemorrhagic events in Scotland","abstract":"id='Par1'>Reports of ChAdOx1 vaccine–associated thrombocytopenia and vascular adverse events have led to some countries restricting its use.\n Using a national prospective cohort, we estimated associations between exposure to first-dose ChAdOx1 or BNT162b2 vaccination and hematological and vascular adverse events using a nested incident-matched case-control study and a confirmatory self-controlled case series (SCCS) analysis.\n An association was found between ChAdOx1 vaccination and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) (0–27 d after vaccination; adjusted rate ratio (aRR) = 5.77, 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.41–13.83), with an estimated incidence of 1.13 (0.62–1.63) cases per 100,000 doses.\n An SCCS analysis confirmed that this was unlikely due to bias (RR?=?1.98 (1.29–3.02)).\n There was also an increased risk for arterial thromboembolic events (aRR = 1.22, 1.12–1.34) 0–27 d after vaccination, with an SCCS RR of 0.97 (0.93–1.02).\n For hemorrhagic events 0–27 d after vaccination, the aRR was 1.48 (1.12–1.96), with an SCCS RR of 0.95 (0.82–1.11).\n A first dose of ChAdOx1 was found to be associated with small increased risks of ITP, with suggestive evidence of an increased risk of arterial thromboembolic and hemorrhagic events.\n The attenuation of effect found in the SCCS analysis means that there is the potential for overestimation of the reported results, which might indicate the presence of some residual confounding or confounding by indication.\n Public health authorities

Aging","abstract":"This paper develops a method for appraising health status in elderly people.\n A frailty index was defined as the proportion of accumulated deficits (symptoms, signs, functional impairments, and laboratory abnormalities).\n It serves as an individual state variable, reflecting severity of illness and proximity to death.\n In a representative database of elderly Canadians we found that deficits accumulated at 3% per year, and show a gamma distribution, typical for systems with redundant components that can be used in case of failure of a given subsystem.\n Of note, the slope of the index is insensitive to the individual nature of the deficits, and serves as an important prognostic factor for life expectancy.\n The formula for estimating an individual's life span given the frailty index value is presented.\n For different patterns of cognitive impairments the average within-group index value increases with the severity of the cognitive impairment, and the relative variability of the index is significantly reduced.\n Finally, the statistical distribution of the frailty index sharply differs between well groups (gamma distribution) and morbid groups (normal distribution).\n This pattern reflects an increase in uncompensated deficits in impaired organisms, which would lead to illness of various etiologies, and ultimately to increased mortality.\n The accumulation of deficits is as an example of a macroscopic variable, i.\ne.\n, one that reflects general properties of aging at the level of the whole organism rather than any given functional deficiency.\n In consequence, we propose that it may be used as a proxy measure of aging.\n","id":"PMC6084020","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"TheScientificWorldJOURNAL","authors":[{"firstname":"Arnold

The World Health Organization (WHO) subsequently named this novel coronavirus as 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV). The virus is similar to the coronavirus responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), a member of the subgenus Sarbecovirus (Beta-CoV lineage B). 2  Common clinical manifestations in COVID-19 patients included fever, fatigue, dry cough, nasal congestion, runny nose, and other respiratory symptoms, as well as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and other gastrointestinal symptoms. A few patients have developed severe pneumonia and they may present with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulation dysfunction or even with death. Previous studies suggested that the infection of 2019-nCoV appeared in clusters was more likely to infect older men with comorbidities, and the earlier stage of the COVID-19 epidemic primarily involved adults older than 15 years. 3 ,  4 ,  5  Compared with adults, the present 2019-nCoV infection in children is relatively rare, but there is an increasing trend, which requires great attention.\nDuring the period from January 2020 to February 19, 2020, 246 patients were found infected with 2019-nCoV and hospitalized in the Public Health Clinic Center of Changsha, the capital city of Hunan province near from Wuhan, where the first COVID-19 patient was reported on January 21, 2020. Among all hospitalized patients, we identified nine patients under 14 years old. The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of children with COVID-19 in Changsha. As COVID-19 is still spreading in other areas and continents, we believe this information would be helpful to clinicians and researchers.\nMETHODS\nThis retrospective and single-center study were done at the Public Health Clinic Center of Changsha, Hunan, China. We identified all hospitalized children diagnosed with COVID-19 between January 8, 2019 and February 19, 2020, in Changsha. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and outcomes data were obtained with data collection forms from electronic medical records. The data were reviewed by two physicians. The information recorded included demographic information (age, sex, and geographic location), medical history, exposure history, clinical features (signs and symptoms at admission, dates of admission and diagnosis), important laboratory results, chest computed tomographic (CT) scans, treatment (intensive care unit, oxygen therapy, antiviral therapy, antibiotics, corticosteroid therapy), prognosis (any severe complications, including death), time from exposure to reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) negative, and discharge date. Efforts were made to reach families of patients to confirm the information.\nAll patients with COVID-19 were classified as follows 6 : (a) Asymptomatic infection: without any clinical symptoms and signs and the chest imaging is normal, while the RT-PCR is positive. (b) Mild: with symptoms of acute upper respiratory tract infection, including fever, fatigue, myalgia, cough, sore throat, runny nose, and sneezing. Physical examination shows the congestion of the pharynx. Some cases may show no fever, or have only digestive symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. (c) Moderate: with pneumonia, frequent fever and cough, mostly dry cough, followed by productive cough, some may have wheezing, but no obvious hypoxemia such as dyspnea, and lungs can hear sputum or dry snoring and/or wet snoring. Some cases have no clinical signs or symptoms with lung lesions in CT images, which are subclinical. (d) Severe: Early respiratory symptoms such as fever and cough, may be accompanied by gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea. The disease usually progresses within 1 week, and dyspnea occurs, with central cyanosis. Oxygen saturation is less than 92%, with other hypoxia manifestations. (e) Critical: Children can quickly progress to ARDS or respiratory failure, and may also have shock, encephalopathy, myocardial injury or heart failure, coagulation dysfunction, and acute kidney injury. Organ dysfunction can be life-threatening.\nThis study was approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University (Approved Number KL-2020003), which waived the requirement for patients' informed consent referring to the CIOMS guideline.\nRESULTS\nNine infected children were identified between January 30, 2019 and February 26, 2020 (Table 1). Six patients were female. The median age was 8 years old, the youngest was 1-year-old and the oldest was 12 years old. Two children lived in Wuhan for several days before they came to Changsha and the others were infected locally. Six children could provide the exact dates of close contact with someone who was confirmed to have 2019-nCoV infection, among whom the median incubation period was 7.5 days, the shortest incubation period was 1 day and the longest incubation period was 16 days. The median time from onset of symptoms to hospital admission was 3 days (range 0-17 days).\nCharacteristics of nine hospitalized children infected with 2019-nCoV outside of Wuhan, China\n	Patient	 	Characteristic	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9	 	Demographics	 	Age, y	1	2	8	8	8	9	9	11	12	 	Sex	Female	Female	Male	Female	Male	Female	Female	Female	Male	 	Exposure history in Wuhan	No	Yes	No	No	No	No	No	Yes	No	 	Family source of exposure	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	 	Time between exposure to symptoms, d	None	None	10	1	9	14	3	6	None	 	Time between onset symptoms to hospital admission, d	10	2	5	15	0	1	17	3	2	 	Symptoms at onset	None	Fever	Fever	Fever and Diarrhea	Diarrhea	Sore throat	None	Cough	Fever	 	Highest temperature,  C	36.8	39.1	37.8	36.7	36.9	36.8	36.5	37.2	37.5	 	Laboratory results	 	White blood cell count x109(4-10)	16.1	7.88	5.43	4.98	5	5.45	7.06	6.06	8.34	 	Lymphocyte countx109 (0.8-4)	9.54	4.05	1.15	2.38	1.82	2.19	3.7	2.65	3.81	 	C-creative protein,mg/L (0-8)	3.58	13.17	2.24	0.2	5.9	1.78	0.2	1.45	0.3	 	Erythrocyte sedimentation rate, mm/h (0-15)	3.28	27	2	4	23	25	15	40	8	 	Lactate dehydrogenase, U/L (135-225)	218	230.7	153.2	159.4	152.9	177.1	175	140.9	132.1	 	Alanine aminotransferase, U/L(0-42)	15.66	18.69	19.69	17.1	15.81	14.48	14.2	13.55	10.5	 	Aspartate aminotransferase, U/L(0-37)	31.42	40.49	28.5	27.8	23.19	31.36	55.1	22.21	14.8	 	Chest x-ray and CT findings	Normal	Small ground-glass opacity	Normal	Normal	Normal	Small ground-glass opacity	Normal	Normal	Normal	 	Treatment	 	Oxygen support	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	 	Intensive unit care	No	No	No	No	No	No	No	No	No	 	Mechanical ventilation	No	No	No	No	No	No	No	No	No	 	Severe complications	No	No	No	No	No	No	No	No	No	 	Antiviral therapy	lopinavir/ritonavir	lopinavir/ritonavir	lopinavir/ritonavir	lopinavir/ritonavir	lopinavir/ritonavir	lopinavir/ritonavir	lopinavir/ritonavir	lopinavir/ritonavir	lopinavir/ritonavir	 	Antibiotic therapy	Azithromycin	Azithromycin	Azithromycin	No	No	No	Azithromycin	No	Azithromycin	 	Meprednisone	No	Yes	No	No	No	No	No	No	No	 	Gamma globulin	No	Yes	No	No	No	No	No	No	No	 	Prognosis	 	Time between exposure to RT-PCR negative, d	14	10	20	Positive	9	14	Positive	13	Positive	 	Time of hospitalization, d	16	12	22	In hospital	11	16	In hospital	15	In hospital	 	\nAbbreviation: CT, computed tomography; RT-PCR, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.\nThis article is being made freely available through PubMed Central as part of the COVID-19 public health emergency response.

Two children had no symptoms but were tested positive for 2019-nCoV in a designated screening because of exposure to infected family members.\nOn admission the number of white blood cells and leukocytes of the children was in the normal range except for an elevation in the 1-year-old child, lactate dehydrogenase of all children was in the normal range, and the aspartate aminotransferase of two children was above the normal range. One child had an elevation of the level of erythrocyte sedimentation rate and two had an elevation of C-reactive protein (CRP) positive. Only two of the enrolled patients showed unilateral small unilateral ground-glass opacities of chest CT scans (Figure 1).\nChest computed tomographies (CTs) on a 9-year-old patient Case: (A) CT image showed ground-glass opacity in the left pulmonary lobe of a 9-year-old female with no sign and symptom on the first day of hospitalization, the followed (B) image showed absorption on day 7\nNine patients received oxygen inhalation through a nasal cannula, but none of the nine children required intensive care or mechanical ventilation or had any severe complications. All of them received antiviral therapies (lopinavir/ritonavir tablets or oral liquid, 10/2.5 mg/kg twice daily, orally), four received antibiotics (azithromycin for suspension, 10 mg/kg once daily, orally) and one received meprednisone and immune globulin therapy for febrile convulsion. As of February 26, six patients tested negative for RT-PCR for 2019-nCoV and were discharged.\nDISCUSSION\nIn this retrospective study, we reported nine pediatric patients of 246 patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCOV infection in Changsha. We described and analyzed the clinical characteristics of pediatric patients with COVID-19. Five of them were mild patients, two were moderate COVID-19 patients and two were asymptomatic carriers. More than half children were confirmed to have had a family source of exposure. Fever was the most frequent symptoms at the onset of illness. The pediatric patients showed few abnormalities in routine blood examinations. Most demonstrated normal CT images.\nThe proportion of infected children identified was very low. A case report (72 314) from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention found the frequency of positive COVID-19 patients under 19 years was 2% (965 cases). 7  This may be due to a lower risk of exposure or incomplete identification due to a mild or asymptomatic presentation. 8 ,  9  Most cases demonstrated familial clustering and the study of COVID-19 in Chinese infants also showed that infants who were be infected by 2019-nCoV had come from families that had at least 1 other infected family member with the infant's infection occurring after the family member's infection. 10  In the SARS studies, a majority of young children and teenage patients had a definite contact history with adult SARS patients (usually an immediate family member), which pattern was consistent with our study. 11 ,  12 ,  13  Six childhood patients were female, consistent with an infant COVID-19 case report (9), 10  but previous studies in adults found higher percentages of infection in men than women. 4 ,  5  A retrospective study of 2143 pediatric patients with COVID-19 in China showed at all ages appeared susceptible to COVID-19, and there was no significant gender difference. 14  Whether or not female children and infants may be more susceptible to 2019-nCoV infection than males requires further study.\nThe symptoms of childhood patients were mild and two of them were asymptomatic carriers. Most children had normal images. Two children showed pneumonia according to their CT scan, but the lesions were limited to small areas of mottling or ground-glass opacities. The most common symptoms at the onset of illness were fever, diarrhea, cough, and sore throat, which was different from the adult presentations. Studies across the country had shown that fever, cough, and fatigue were the most frequent symptoms and fever affected nearly 90% and cough more than 50%. 7 ,  15 ,  16 ,  17  Studies of SARS in newborns and children reported that the clinical course and prognosis differed between pediatric and adult SARS patients. Young children (&lt;12 years) experienced in general a less aggressive clinical course than teenage or adult patients. 18  \nIn 2019-nCoV infected children, most peripheral blood white blood cell counts and an absolute number of lymphocytes were normal, CRP was normal or slightly elevated, and liver enzymes were elevated in some children, 19  which was consistent with our study. In our study, the child with an elevation level of white blood cells and lymphocytes was 1-year-old, however, considering other laboratory results of this patient, other possible infection of these patients was excluded. The immature immune system of the infant may as an interpretation of these abnormal results but still need more studies to prove that. No one required intensive care or mechanical ventilation or had any severe complications and most of them did not need to use meprednisone or immune globulin. But in existing studies of patients with COVID-19. About 20% to 30% of patients infected with 2019-nCoV need intensive care and more than 20% needed glucocorticoid therapy. 4 ,  5 ,  20  \nMost pediatric patients' cases were mild, with much fewer severe and critical cases (5.9%) than adult patients (18.5%). 14 ,  21  Why the children and infant patients demonstrated minimal symptoms and less severe compared with adults is not clear. This may be related to the fact that the 2019-nCoV has been reported to share the same receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) with SARS-CoV and that the ACE2 virus receptor expression is concentrate in a small population of type II alveolar cells (AT2). While the 2019-nCoV virus is able to use human ACE2 as a receptor, thus having some potential for replication in human cells, 22 ,  23  the inadequate expression of ACE2 cells or inadequate expression of ACE2 receptors or the immature function of ACE2 cells could possibly explain the milder symptoms in a child with COVID-19. Another explanation for this difference may be related to the immature immune system of children. Since the immune function of adults is well developed, the highly pathogenic coronavirus could induce a robust immune response, causing a substantial cytokine storm and producing severe clinical symptoms. 24  As the immune function of children is not mature, serious immune damage would plausibly not be stimulated, and the clinical expression would be milder, just as the minimally pathogenic coronavirus infecting the upper respiratory tract and causing mild, cold-like respiratory illness. More research is needed to clarify the age-related changes in the inflammatory responses to these viral agents.\nLimitations of this study include the small sample size and the restricted geographic origin of the subjects. A larger, more geographically diverse cohort study population will be needed to characterize more fully the clinical characteristics of childhood COVID-19 patients.\nIn conclusion, the clinical symptoms of the new coronavirus infection in children are not typical, which deserves a further and large-scale study. Children who have family clustering or have family members with a definite diagnosis should be reported to ensure a timely diagnosis.\nCONFLICT OF INTERESTS\nThe authors declare that there are no

associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family

coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing Municipal Science and Technology

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

mortality in critical illness: an observational cohort study","abstract":"Introduction\nThe neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a biological marker that has been shown to be associated with outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.\n\n Increasing quartile of NLR was statistically significantly associated with secondary outcome.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR is associated with outcomes in unselected critically ill patients.\n\n In patients with sepsis, there was no statistically significant relationship between NLR and mortality.\n\n Further investigation is required to increase understanding of the pathophysiology of this relationship and to validate these findings with data collected prospectively.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article

a major threat to public health1–3.\n Despite intense research efforts, how, when and where new diseases appear are still a source of considerable uncertainty.\n A severe respiratory disease was recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China5.\n This outbreak highlights the ongoing ability of viral spill-over from animals to cause

Importantly, strains with high genetic similarity to SARS-CoV in the hypervariable N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 gene, the ORF3 and ORF8 region, respectively, were all discovered in this cave.\n In addition, we report the first discovery of bat SARSr-CoVs highly similar to human SARS-CoV in ORF3b and in the split ORF8a and 8b.\n Moreover, SARSr-CoV strains from this cave were more closely related to SARS-CoV in the non-structural protein genes ORF1a and 1b compared with those detected elsewhere.\n Recombination analysis shows evidence of frequent recombination events within the S gene and around the ORF8 between these SARSr-CoVs.\n We hypothesize that the direct progenitor of SARS-CoV may have originated after sequential recombination events between the precursors of these SARSr-CoVs.\n Cell entry studies demonstrated that three newly identified SARSr-CoVs with different S protein sequences are all able to use human ACE2 as the receptor, further exhibiting the close relationship between strains in this cave and SARS-CoV.\n This work provides new insights into the origin and evolution of SARS-CoV and highlights the necessity of preparedness for future emergence of SARS-like diseases.\n","id":"PMC5708621","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Ben","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei-Ping","surname":"Zeng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xing-Lou","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xing-Yi","surname":"Ge","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bei","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jia-Zheng","surname":"Xie","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xu-Rui","surname":"Shen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yun-Zhi","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ning","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dong-Sheng","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiao-Shuang","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mei-Niang","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peter","surname":"Daszak","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin-Fa","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin-Fa","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jie","surname":"Cui","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng-Li","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng-Li","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christian","surname":"Drosten","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christian","surname":"Drosten","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christian","surname":"Drosten","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1128/JVI.06882-11","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Evidence for a common evolutionary origin of coronavirus spike protein receptor-binding subunits","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1126/science.1116480","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Structure of SARS coronavirus spike receptor-binding domain complexed with receptor","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00255","date":"1970-01-01","title":"ff14SB: improving the accuracy of protein side chain and backbone parameters from ff99SB","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1038/nature12005","date":"2013-02-13","title":"Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 is a functional receptor for the emerging human coronavirus-EMC","abstract":"Supplementary information\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1038/nature12005) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7095326","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing Group UK","authors":[{"firstname":"V.

to bind the E protein PBM during SARS-CoV infection by using three complementary strategies, yeast two-hybrid, reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy assays.\n Syntenin redistributed

severe acute respiratory infection.\n\n We did diagnostic RT-PCR and indirect immunofluorescence.\n\n From time of diagnosis, respiratory, faecal, and urine samples were obtained for virus

Klinikum Schwabing on March 19, 2013, on day 11 of illness.\n\n He had been diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 2008, and had received several lines of treatment.\n\n The patient died on day 18, due to septic shock.\n\n MERS-CoV was detected in two samples of bronchoalveolar fluid.\n\n Viral loads were highest in samples from the lower respiratory tract (up to 1·2?×?106 copies per mL).\n\n Maximum

mRNA in monocytes prevented their accumulation in sites of inflammation.\n Specifically, the treatment attenuated their number in atherosclerotic plaques, reduced infarct size following coronary artery occlusion, prolonged normoglycemia in diabetic mice after pancreatic islet transplantation and resulted in reduced tumor volumes and lower numbers of tumor-associated macrophages.\n Taken together, siRNA nanoparticle-mediated CCR2 gene silencing in leukocytes selectively modulates functions of innate immune cell subtypes and may allow for the development of specific anti-inflammatory therapy.\n","id":"PMC3212614","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"NULL","authors":[{"firstname":"Florian","surname":"Leuschner","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Partha","surname":"Dutta","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rostic","surname":"Gorbatov","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tatiana

employ anti-immune strategies to facilitate their replication, highly pathogenic virus infections can also cause an excessive immune response that exacerbates, rather than reduces pathogenicity.\n\n To investigate this dichotomy in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), we developed a transcriptional network model of SARS-CoV infection in mice and used the model to prioritize candidate regulatory targets for further investigation.\n\n\nResults\nWe validated our predictions in 18 different knockout (KO) mouse strains, showing that network topology provides significant predictive power to identify genes that are important for viral infection.\n\n We identified a novel player in the immune response to virus infection, Kepi, an inhibitory subunit of the protein

of 33 Cases in Children Infected With SARS-CoV-2 in Anhui Province, China-A Multi-Center Retrospective Cohort Study\nBackground: As of 23rd February 2020, China had 77,048 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections, and only 2. 1% of patients were under the age of 19 years. Morbidity among children was much lower, with milder or absent signs and symptoms; chest CT scans showed milder symptoms, if at all, compared to adults.\nObjective: Report the epidemiological, clinical features, laboratory, radiological characteristics, and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Compare additional signs and symptoms, investigate familial clustering, compare laboratory results, and find out relevance between age and typical chest CT scans in patients.\nMethods: We studied 33 young patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in Anhui Province of China by 16th February 2020. Their signs, symptoms, and familial clustering were analyzed. We compared the laboratory test results, age, and gender among three parts based on their chest CT scans.\nResults: Familial clustering was seen in 30 (30/33; 90.91%) patients; three families had seven confirmed members infected with the disease. Eight (8/33; 24.24%) patients had no symptoms, 12 (12/33; 36.36%) patients had only fever, nine (9/33; 27.27%) patients had fever and additional symptoms, and 12 (12/33; 36.36%) patients had no fever. Dry cough was the most common additional symptom. In 25 (25/33; 75.76%) patients, the percent of lymphocytes decreased; 26 (26/33; 78.79%) patients were older than 7 years. More male than female patients and patients older than 8 years showed typical abnormalities in the chest CT scans (P = 0.038). Only two 18 years old patients had hepatic injury.\nConclusion: Children's infection is mild and familial clustering was the most common channel. The older patients had more typical ground glass opacity (GGO) or consolidation in chest CT scans. Cases without fever strongly suggested that non-symptomatic children should not be assumed to be free of infection when their family members have confirmed infection. Most children showed clinical features distinguishable from adults and with increased susceptibility within family members.\nIntroduction\nSince December 2019, the epidemic of coronavirus-2019 (SARS-COV-2) has spread throughout the world, rapidly resulting in 4,330,982 confirmed cases and 295,671 deaths as of 6th May 2020. Anhui province was the third region to be affected by coronavirus-2019 in China, with Hubei and Guangdong provinces being the first two. Among the patients, only 2.1% were under the age of 19 years. Not only was their morbidity less than adults, their clinical features were also milder. And a few of them showed no signs and symptoms of the infection.\nHowever, every child with a confirmed SARS-COV-2 infection is being diagnosed as having novel coronavirus pneumonia (&quot;NCP&quot;), even though some of them had no fever, cough, fatigue, or typical radiological characteristics in a chest CT.\nHere, we report 33 patients under the age of 19 years with confirmed COVID-19 infection from Anhui province, China, and describe the clinical features, laboratory, and radiological characteristics of a chest CT, treatment, and clinical outcome. We also report the patients' history of contact with infected person/s (direct or indirect), and (familial clustering). These cases highlight the importance of familial clustering clinical features, chest CT characteristics, and age. We aim to share our findings and recommend that pediatricians reconsider the diagnoses of children with confirmed infection.\nPatients and Methods\nA total of 33 patients were enrolled in this study who were admitted to one of the 10 hospitals in Anhui province in China between December 2019 and February 2020. The inclulsion criteris was: being under 19 years of age having respiratory specimens that were analyzed twice by real-time RT-PCR, and being diagnosed according to the World Health Organization's interim guidance. All the cases were discharged with twice negative real-time RT-PCR up to 6th May 2020. All case data can be provided on request.\nThirteen cases from Bozhou People's Hospital, seven cases from No. 2 People's Hospital of Fuyang City, four cases from Wanbei Coal-Electricity Group General Hospital of minors, two cases from The Second People's Hospital of Wuhu, two cases from Anhui Provincial Children's Hospital, one case from The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China, one case from Ma'anshan maternal and child health care hospital, one case from The First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College, one case from The People's hospital of Lu'an City, and one case from the Maternity and Children Health Care Hospital of Tongling City.\nThe medical data were analyzed by the medical team from the pediatric department at the First Affiliated Hospital of USTC. Information recorded included demographic data, medical history, familial clustering, details of the confirmed patients, if any, in the family, whether they were residents of Wuhan, or traveled to Wuhan, whether they came in contact with confirmed patients, signs, and symptoms, including pharyngodynia, fever, cough, vomiting and diarrhea, fatigue, tightness in the chest, total WBC and lymphocyte percentages, levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), IL-6, liver function, CKMB, a marker of myocardial injury, chest CT, administration of INF a, lopinavir and ritonavir, ribavirin, or arbidol, and titers of Mp-IgM, anti-parainfluenza virus IgM, anti-influenza virus IgM, and anti-adenovirus IgM. The laboratory test results and statistical analyses were the first ones carried out since the symptoms were noticed.\nAs lymphocyte population vary according to age a lymphocyte content of &lt;60% in patients below 7 years of age and &lt;30% in patients over 7 years of age is considered as &quot;lymphocyte percentage decrease.&quot;\nWe divided the chest CT images into three classes: (1) typical abnormalities, with bilateral multiple lobular and subsegmental areas of consolidation or bilateral ground-glass opacity (GGO) and subsegmental areas of consolidation or GGO; (2) non-typical abnormalities, showing nodal and patchy shadow of bilateral median and extrapulmonary zone; and (3) Normal.\nWe divided the 33 cases under study based on various aspects. When the incidence of fever was considered, they were classified into two groups: with fever and without fever, and the baseline characteristics and differences in other signs and symptoms between the two groups were analyzed. From these data, the percentage of confirmed familial cluster among the cases, and the predominance of different signs and symptoms in the cases were estimated. Based on the laboratory results, we divided the cases into three phases: total WBC &lt;= 5X109/L, 5-10X109/L, and &gt;10X109/L, and counted the cases in different phases. We also divided the cases into two categories: decreased and non-decreased, based on the percentage of lymphocytes, and scored the number of cases in each of these categories. When the radiological characteristics of chest CT were considered, the cases were divided into three parts: typical, non- typical, and normal. We also considered differences based on age and gender, details of the treatment, including the drugs administered in all cases, and identified the most widely used ones among these cases.\nStatistics\nA retrospective cohort study was used to analyze the epidemiological data, clinical symptoms, and signs, changes in WBC and total lymphocyte counts, chest CT, and the different treatments in children infected with SARS-COV-2. A comparison of the baseline characteristics of the data and signs and symptoms revealed that in both the groups fever was a common symptom. The data were analyzed using cases number (n) and percentage (%), except for the age of the patients, which was calculated as the mean. Cases were divided into three categories, according to the severity of chest CT (typical, non-typical, and normal), and compared the differences in age and sex between the three categories. Variables between these were presented as numbers and percentages, and continuous variables were presented as mean +- standard deviation. Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test was used to compare categorical variables, and Student's t-test was used for continuous variables. A two-sided p &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Data were analyzed using SPSS Statistics version 19.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).\nEthics\nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by Anhui Provincial Hospital (The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC) Medical Research Ethics Committee. Written informed consent to participate in this study was provided by the participants' legal guardian/next of kin. In particular, written informed consent was obtained from the individual(s) for the publication of any potentially identifiable images or data included in this article.\nResults\nAmong the 33 cases, the fever group (n = 21) had more patients than the non-fever group (n = 12). Baseline characteristics, including demographic data, familial clusters, Wuhan residence, travel to Wuhan, and contact with confirmed patients were not significantly different between the two groups (Table 1).\nBaseline characteristics of children patients infected with SARS-COV-2.\nNo. (%)	Total (n = 33)	Fever (n = 21)	Non-fever (n = 12)	t/chi2	**p-value	 	*Age	9.59 +- 5.12	11.50 +- 3.93	-1.118		0.272*	 	#Sex						 	 Female	17	11	6	0.017	0.895	 	 Male	16	10	6			 	#Familial cluster (yes)	30	18 (85.7%)	12 (100%)	1.886	0.284	 	#Wuhan residence (yes)	8	5 (23.3%)	3 (25.0%)	0.006	1.0	 	#Travel in Wuhan (yes)	3	2 (4.3%)	1 (8.3%)	0.265	0.607	 	#Contact confirmed patients (yes)	30	18 (85.7%)	12 (100%)	1.886	0.284	 	\nMean (SD).\nP &lt; 0.05.\nChi-square (and Fisher's exact) test.\nAmong the 33 cases under study, 12 (12/33; 36.36%) had only fever, six (6/33; 18.18%) had a dry cough, two (2/33; 6.06%) had vomiting and diarrhea, and 13 (13/33; 39.39%) were placed in the &quot;Others&quot; group, showing symptoms like rhinorrhea, sneezing, sore throat, fatigue, and herpes (Table 2).\nSigns and symptoms of children patients infected with SARS-COV-2.\nNo. (%)	Total (n = 33)	Fever (n = 21)	Non-fever (n = 12)	t/chi2	**p-value	 	Only fever	12	12 (57.14%)	0	8.45	0.04	 	#Dry cough	6	4 (19.05%)	2 (16.67%)	0.036	0.849	 	#Vomiting and diarrhea	2	2 (9.52%)	0	0.12	0.73	 	Others	13	3 (14.29%)	10 (83.33%)	12.49	&lt;0.01 (0.0004)	 	\nP &lt; 0.05.\nChi-square (and Fisher's exact) test.\nThirty cases (30/33; 90.91%) exhibited familial clustering. There were three families, each of whom had seven members with confirmed SARS-COV-2. Fourteen families (14/33; 42.43%) had two confirmed members (Figure 1). Overall, eight (8/33; 24.24%) cases had no symptoms, 12 (12/33; 36.36%) had only fever, nine (9/33; 27.27%) had both fever and additional symptoms, while 12 (12/33; 36.36%) were without fever. Dry cough was the most common symptom in addition to fever, and additional symptoms included vomiting, diarrhea, and fatigue (Figure 2). Total WBC count was &lt;5*109/L in 13 cases, between 5x109/L and 10x109/L in 14 cases, and more than 10x109/L is six cases. Twenty-five cases presented with a decreased lymphocyte population, while eight cases did not (Figure 3). Among the patients under study, seven were under 6 years, 13 were school-age children, and 13 were older than the school-age children. In the three classes based on chest CT images, typical abnormalities occurred in children older than 8 years (Figure 4).\nFamilial cluster.\nSigns and symptoms.\nLaboratory test.\nClass of chest CT and age distribution.\nWe divided 33 chest CT images into typical abnormalities (n = 6), non-typical abnormalities (n = 8), and normal (n = 19).

The number of female patients in the normal group was higher than in the other groups and the differences were significant (P = 0.038) (Table 3). Most of the typical abnormalities showed GGO with patchy consolidations at subpleural focal changes on CT image (Figure 5A) and non-typical abnormalities CT image mostly showed increased lung marking or dense hilar shadows (Figure 5B).\nInfected with 2019-nCnV.\n	Typical (n = 6)	Non-typical (n = 8)	Normal (n = 19)	t/chi2	**p-value	 	*Age	11.83 +- 3.71	8.16 +- 5.32	10.68 +- 4.71	1.200	0.315	 	#Sex						 	Female	1	3	13	6.531	0.038	 	Male	5	5	6			 	\nMean (SD).\nP &lt; 0.05.\nChi-square (and Fisher's exact) test.\n(A1-3) Chest CT image with typical abnormalities.

We did not find any difference in the curative effects of these drugs.\nDiscussion\nWe present here a descriptive study on the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of the COVID-19 infection. We collected data on 33 young patients (&lt;19 years of age) who were admitted to one of the 10 hospitals in Anhui Province, China. This report presents the latest data and status of COVID-19 infection in Anhui Province, China.\nAs of February 23, 77048 laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections were reported in China. Among these, 2.1% were below 19 years of age. Coronavirus is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus, capable of rapid mutations and recombination. This novelbeta-coronavirus belongs to lineage B or subgenus sarbecovirus, that includes the human SARS coronavirus.\nAs of February 23, 2020, among the 33 patients included in this study, no dyspnea or similar complications were reported, and none of them were critically ill.\nCOVID-19 infection is associated with clustering onset. The data in this cohort study showed that only three patients had no familial clustering history, including two patients who were residents of Wuhan. A majority of these patients (30, or 30/33; 90.91%) cases showed familial clustering. Three families had seven members each, and five families had four patients each with confirmed infection. Among all cases, two were twins, two were sisters, and four were cousins. This suggests rapid person-to-person transmission of COVID-19, similar to what happens in adults. COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets or through contact. In addition, current research shows that it may also be transmitted through the fecal-oral route, inhalation through aerosols produced through coughing by the infected family members, relatives, and healthcare workers, or though other sources in the environment. A recent study also suggested that infection in the womb or during birth could not be denied completely. Nevertheless, in children, familial clustering is an important factor in rapid human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 through close family contacts. Therefore, vigilant control measures should be taken at an early stage of the infection in a family.\nAs other studies reported, we noticed that SARS-COV-2 less commonly affects children, and that they have much fewer symptoms and less severe cases compared with adults, and also much lower case-fatality rates. In our study, none of the cases had difficulty breathing or needed oxygen support; this is different to adult cases. The common symptoms at the onset of illness were fever and dry cough. Huang reported fever [40 of 41 patients [98%]], cough (76%), myalgia or fatigue (44%), headache (8%), hemoptysis (5%), and diarrhea (3%). Wang et al. reported common symptoms, including fever (98.6%), fatigue (69.6%), dry cough (59.4%), myalgia (34.8%), and diarrhea and nausea (10.1%). However, 12 (12/33; 36.36%) cases in the present study were without fever and a small proportion of patients presented initially with atypical symptoms, like fatigue, sore throat, rhinorrhea, sneezing, vomiting, diarrhea, and herpes. One of them had a sore throat at the onset of symptoms and one had fatigue; the status was the same as that of adults. A 27-year-old man was reported with vomiting and loose stools before admission. Michelle et al. reported the first case in the United States which was that of a 35-year-old man, with a &quot;subjective fever&quot; of 37.2 C. This patient presented with a persistent dry cough, nausea, and vomiting. In a report of 99 cases, 20% had no fever or cough at the onset. This suggests that measuring the body temperature cannot be considered as a decisive screening method. Furthermore, in our report, there were eight (8/33; 24.24%) cases without any early signs or symptoms. When present, the signs and symptoms were from the respiratory system (upper and lower) to the digestive system. We speculate that this observation probably indicates that the target cells might be located in different tissues, and this may change with age.\nIn most of the cases enrolled in this study, the total WBC count was normal or decreased. The percentage of lymphocytes decreased in 25 (25/33; 75.75%) cases. Many reports of adults showed the routine blood test was useful as a diagnostic tool. A decrease in lymphocyte count indicates that SARS-COV-2 affects immune cells and inhibits cellular immune function. T lymphocyte damage might be an important factor in exacerbating the condition of patients. The decreasing percentage of lymphocytes could prompt SARS- COV-2 infections in the clinic. In addition, Huang et al. reported that 40% of the cases they studied showed hepatic injury, five cases had myocardial injury, and injuries were more severe in critical patients. In our study, none of the patients showed myocardial injury, only two 18-year-old patients showed hepatic involvement. This difference may be attributed to better liver regeneration capacity and better ability to recover from myocardial injury.\nSix (6/33; 18.18%) cases had typical GGO or consolidation of the lungs as the primary findings on CT scans. All the patients were more than 8 years old. The infants and preschool-age children had atypical chest CT scans or normal CT. A familial clustering report suggested that the symptoms of COVID-19 were non-specific, but the three oldest patients in that family had more critical symptoms. It may be because the trachea, bronchi, and capillaries are relatively thin in childhood, and children's lungs are rich in connective tissue, poorly developed elastic tissue, abundant blood vessels, capable of holding less air, have fewer alveoli, and a less well-developed pulmonary interstitium. More research focused on the function of ACE2 as the SARS-CoV-2 receptor and proved the binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 lead to driving the systemic manifestations of COVID-19, including respiratory clinical feature and cardiovascular complication. Most elderly patients routinely take ACE2 receptor antagonists to treat high blood pressure, which increases the expression of ACE2 and helps COVID-19 enter the cells. On the contrary, the level of ACE2 expression in children is low and therefore the symptoms are mild. In both healthy and diabetic individuals, ACE2/ACE is negatively correlated with age. Many reports have shown that older males are more likely to be infected by COVID-19. The atypical and normal chest CT scans suggest that more attention needs to be paid to young children. We also observed a greater number of males than females with typical CT scans. In adults, the proportion of confirmed infection in men is higher than in women. However, Wei et al. reported nine infected infants from 1 to 11 months, and seven of them were females. Thus, COVID-19 is more likely to infect adult and older males.\nOn January 9, 2020, Chinese scientists identified the cause of a new illness as a novel coronavirus, and as of January 10, 41 confirmed cases of coronavirus pneumonia had been reported in Wuhan city. This is the first time this disease was called &quot;NCP.&quot; This new virus was designated as WH-Human 1 coronavirus (WHCV) and has also been referred to as &quot;2019-nCoV.&quot; Huang et al. reported that all patients had pneumonia. The virus was given the official name of COVID-19 by the WHO on February 11, 2020, and this name is more scientific and suitable. In this retrospective study, we report 12 cases without fever and eight cases without any signs and symptoms, and all cases were mild. Only six cases had typical GGO or consolidation on CT scans. We divided the patients into those with typical signs and symptoms such as fever, dry cough, and atypical sore throat, fatigue, vomiting, and diarrhea. We also divided the chest CT scans into typical, atypical, and normal. We suggest more attention should be paid on the children without syndrome but with family member infected by COVID-19.\nThis is a small case report of patients admitted to different hospitals, and the test results and chest CT scan results were not homogenous. It is necessary to follow up the cases enrolled in this study until all of them are discharged from the hospital, and also to test the respiratory specimens 2 weeks after discharge to re-confirm that all of them are cured of SARS-COV-2 infection.\nConclusion\nChildren's infection is mild and familial clustering was the most common channel of infection. The older patients had more typical ground glass opacity (GGO) or consolidation in chest CT scans. Cases without fever strongly suggested that non-symptomatic children should not be assumed to be free of infection when their family members have confirmed infection. Children were highly susceptible to COVID-19 and they showed clinical features distinguishbale from adults.\nData Availability Statement\nAll datasets generated for this study are included in the article/supplementary material.\nEthics Statement\nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by Anhui Provincial Hospital Medical Research Ethics Committee.

familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study","abstract":"Background\nIn December, 2019, a pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China.\n\n We aimed to further clarify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data.\n\n Outcomes were followed up until Jan 25, 2020.\nFindings\nOf the 99 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, 49 (49%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market.\n\n The average age of the patients was 55·5 years (SD 13·1), including 67 men and 32 women.\n\n 2019-nCoV was detected in all patients by real-time RT-PCR.\n\n 50 (51%) patients had chronic diseases.\n\n Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (82 [83%] patients), cough (81 [82%] patients), shortness of breath (31 [31%] patients), muscle ache (11 [11%] patients), confusion (nine [9%] patients), headache (eight [8%] patients), sore throat (five [5%] patients), rhinorrhoea (four [4%] patients), chest pain (two [2%] patients), diarrhoea (two [2%] patients), and nausea and vomiting (one [1%] patient).\n\n According to imaging examination, 74 (75%) patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 14 (14%) patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity, and one (1%) patient had pneumothorax.\n\n 17 (17%) patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and, among them, 11 (11%) patients worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection was of clustering onset, is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n In general, characteristics of patients who died were in line with the MuLBSTA score, an early warning model for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia.\n\n Further investigation is needed to explore the applicability of the MuLBSTA score in predicting the risk of mortality in 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key R&amp;D Program of China.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7135076","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41

(one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future

could have far-reaching consequences for public health and for pandemic control strategies.\n In this paper, we argue that a comprehensive and more nuanced analysis is required to test this hypothesis, taking into consideration both environmental dynamics and the persistence of viral infectivity.\n First, we examine the evidence regarding the presence of the virus in stools and sewage.\n Then we discuss the current framework of disease transmission through water and excreta and how the transmission of a respiratory disease fits into it.\n Against this background, we propose a framework to test the faecal-oral hypothesis, unpacking the different environmental routes from faeces to the mouth of a susceptible person.\n This framework should not be seen as a confirmation of the hypothesis but rather as an expanded view of its complexities, which could help shaping an agenda for research into a number of unanswered questions.\n Finally, the paper briefly discusses practical implications, based on current knowledge, for containment of the pandemic.\n","id":"PMC7182518","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

pandemic, is accompanied by the shedding of the virus in stool.\n Therefore, the quantification of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater affords the ability to monitor the prevalence of infections among the population via wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE).\n In the current work, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was concentrated from wastewater in a catchment in Australia and viral RNA copies were enumerated using reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) resulting in two positive detections within a six day period from the same wastewater treatment plant (WWTP).\n The estimated viral RNA copy numbers observed in the wastewater were then used to estimate the number of infected individuals in the catchment via Monte Carlo simulation.\n Given the uncertainty and variation in the input parameters, the model estimated a median range of 171 to 1,090 infected persons in the catchment, which is in reasonable agreement with clinical observations.\n This work highlights the viability of WBE for monitoring infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, in communities.\n The work also draws attention to the need for further methodological and molecular assay validation for enveloped viruses in wastewater.\n","id":"PMC7165106","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Published by Elsevier

cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause was identified in Wuhan, a city of 11 million persons in the People’s Republic of China.\n Further investigation revealed these cases to result from infection with a newly identified coronavirus, initially termed 2019-nCoV and subsequently SARS-CoV-2. The infection moved rapidly through China, spread to Thailand and Japan, extended into adjacent countries through infected persons travelling by air, eventually reaching multiple countries and continents.\n Similar to such other coronaviruses as those causing the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the new coronavirus was reported to spread via natural aerosols from human-to-human.\n In the early stages of this epidemic the case fatality rate is estimated to be approximately 2%, with the majority of deaths occurring in special populations.\n Unfortunately, there is limited experience with coronavirus infections during pregnancy, and it now appears certain that pregnant women have become infected during the present 2019-nCoV epidemic.\n In order to assess the potential of the Wuhan 2019-nCoV to cause maternal, fetal and neonatal morbidity and other poor obstetrical outcomes, this communication reviews the published data addressing the epidemiological and clinical effects of SARS, MERS, and other coronavirus infections on pregnant women and their infants.\n Recommendations are also made for the consideration of pregnant women in the design, clinical trials, and implementation of future 2019-nCoV vaccines.\n","id":"PMC7077337","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"David A.","surname":"Schwartz","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ashley L.","surname":"Graham","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Ashley L.","surname":"Graham","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References depth 2":[]},{"doi":"10.1097/INF.0000000000002660","date":"2020-03-03","title":"Coronavirus Infections in Children Including COVID-19","abstract":"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a large family of enveloped, single-stranded, zoonotic RNA viruses.\n Four CoVs commonly circulate among humans: HCoV2-229E, -HKU1, -NL63 and -OC43. However, CoVs can rapidly mutate and recombine leading to novel CoVs that can spread from animals to humans.\n The novel CoVs severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012. The 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is currently causing a severe outbreak of disease (termed COVID-19) in China and multiple other countries, threatening to cause a global pandemic.\n In humans, CoVs mostly cause respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms.\n Clinical manifestations range from a common cold to more severe disease such as bronchitis, pneumonia, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure and even death.\n SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 seem to less commonly affect children and to cause fewer symptoms and less severe disease in this age group compared with adults, and are associated with much lower case-fatality rates.\n Preliminary evidence suggests children are just as likely as adults to become infected with SARS-CoV-2 but are less likely to be symptomatic or develop severe symptoms.\n However, the importance of children in transmitting the virus remains uncertain.\n Children more often have gastrointestinal symptoms compared with adults.\n Most children with SARS-CoV present with fever, but this is not the case for the other novel CoVs.\n Many children affected by MERS-CoV are asymptomatic.\n The majority of children infected by novel CoVs have a documented household contact, often showing symptoms before them.\n In contrast, adults more often have a nosocomial exposure.\n In this review, we summarize epidemiologic, clinical and diagnostic findings, as well as treatment and prevention options for common circulating and novel CoVs infections in humans with a focus on infections in

Epidemiologic and Clinical Features","abstract":"The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has spread rapidly across the globe.\n In contrast to initial reports, recent studies suggest that children are just as likely as adults to become infected with the virus but have fewer symptoms and less severe disease.\n In this review, we summarize the epidemiologic and clinical features of children infected with SARS-CoV-2 reported in pediatric case series to date.\n We also summarize the perinatal outcomes of neonates born to women infected with SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy.\n We found 11 case series including a total of 333 infants and children.\n Overall, 83% of the children had a positive contact history, mostly with family members.\n The incubation period varied between 2 and 25 days with a mean of 7 days.\n The virus could be isolated from nasopharyngeal secretions for up to 22 days and from stool for more than 30 days.\n Co-infections were reported in up to 79% of children (mainly mycoplasma and influenza).\n Up to 35% of children were asymptomatic.\n The most common symptoms were cough (48%; range 19%–100%), fever (42%; 11%–100%) and pharyngitis (30%; 11%–100%).\n Further symptoms were nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, tachypnoea, wheezing, diarrhea, vomiting, headache and fatigue.\n Laboratory test parameters were only minimally altered.\n Radiologic findings were unspecific and included unilateral or bilateral infiltrates with, in some cases, ground-glass opacities or consolidation with a surrounding halo sign.\n Children rarely needed admission to intensive care units (3%), and to date, only a small number of deaths have been reported in children globally.\n Nine case series and 2 case reports described outcomes of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy in 65 women and 67 neonates.\n Two mothers (3%) were admitted to intensive care unit.\n Fetal distress was reported in 30% of pregnancies.\n Thirty-seven percent of women delivered preterm.\n Neonatal complications included respiratory distress or pneumonia (18%), disseminated intravascular coagulation (3%), asphyxia (2%) and 2 perinatal deaths.\n Four neonates (3 with pneumonia) have been reported to be SARS-CoV-2 positive despite strict infection control and prevention procedures during delivery and separation of mother and neonates, meaning vertical transmission could not be excluded.\n","id":"PMC7363381","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Williams &amp;

coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future

cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.\n\n Increasing quartile of NLR was statistically significantly associated with secondary outcome.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR is associated with outcomes in unselected critically ill patients.\n\n In patients with sepsis, there was no statistically significant relationship between NLR and mortality.\n\n Further investigation is required to increase understanding of the pathophysiology of this relationship and to validate these findings with data collected prospectively.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article

recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like

humans was quickly halted by public health measures and human infections of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) have not been observed since.\n However, other coronaviruses still pose a continuous threat to human health, as exemplified by the recent emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in humans.\n The work on SARS-CoV widens our knowledge on the epidemiology, pathophysiology and immunology of coronaviruses and may shed light on MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV).\n It has been confirmed that T-cell immunity plays an important role in recovery from SARS-CoV infection.\n Herein, we summarize T-cell immunological studies of SARS-CoV and discuss the potential cross-reactivity of the SARS-CoV-specific immunity against MERS-CoV, which may provide useful recommendations for the

The loss of ACE2 function following binding by SARS-CoV-2 is driven by endocytosis and activation of proteolytic cleavage and processing.\n The ACE2 system is a critical protective pathway against heart failure with reduced and preserved ejection fraction including, myocardial infarction and hypertension, and against lung disease and diabetes mellitus.\n The control of gut dysbiosis and vascular permeability by ACE2 has emerged as an essential mechanism of pulmonary hypertension and diabetic cardiovascular complications.\n Recombinant ACE2, gene-delivery of Ace2, Ang 1–7 analogs, and Mas receptor agonists enhance ACE2 action and serve as potential therapies for disease conditions associated with an activated renin-angiotensin system.\n rhACE2 (recombinant human ACE2) has completed clinical trials and efficiently lowered or increased plasma angiotensin II and angiotensin 1-7 levels, respectively.\n Our review summarizes the progress over the past 20 years, highlighting the critical role of ACE2 as the novel SARS-CoV-2 receptor and as the negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system, together with implications for the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and associated cardiovascular diseases.\n","id":"PMC7188049","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Lippincott Williams &amp;

also demonstrates remarkable sex differences.\n Although the reasons for sex differences in immune responses are not precisely understood, it potentially involves differences in sex hormones (estrogens, androgens, and differential sex hormone receptor-mediated events), X-chromosomes, microbiome, epigenetics among others.\n Overall, females tend to have more responsive and robust immune system compared to their male counterparts.\n It is therefore not surprising that females respond more aggressively to self-antigens and are more susceptible to autoimmune diseases.\n Female hormone (estrogen or 17?-estradiol) can potentially act on all cellular subsets of the immune system through estrogen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms.\n This minireview highlights differential expression of estrogen receptors on immune cells, major estrogen-mediated signaling pathways, and their effect on immune cells.\n Since estrogen has varied effects in female-predominant autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus, we will mechanistically postulate the potential differential role of estrogen in these chronic debilitating

differentiation of innate immune cells and inflammatory T cells.\n Consequently, deregulated NF-?B activation contributes to the pathogenic processes of various inflammatory diseases.\n In this review, we will discuss the activation and function of NF-?B in association with inflammatory diseases and highlight the development of therapeutic strategies based on NF-?B

bacterial infections has been reported in both humans and animal models.\n\n Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms involved in this gender bias are just starting to be elucidated.\n\n In the present article, we aim to review the available data in the literature that report bacterial infections presenting a clear sexual dimorphism, without considering behavioral and social factors.\n\n\nMain body\nid='Par2'>The sexual dimorphism in bacterial infections has been mainly attributed to the differential levels of sex hormones between males and females, as well as to genetic factors.\n\n In general, males are more susceptible to gastrointestinal and respiratory bacterial diseases and sepsis, while females are more susceptible to genitourinary tract bacterial infections.\n\n However, these incidences depend on the population evaluated, animal model and the bacterial species.\n\n Female protection against bacterial infections and the associated complications is assumed to be due to the pro-inflammatory effect of estradiol, while male susceptibility to those infections is associated with the testosterone-mediated immune suppression, probably via their specific receptors.\n\n Recent studies indicate that the protective effect of estradiol depends on the estrogen receptor subtype and the specific tissue compartment involved in the bacterial insult, suggesting that tissue-specific expression of particular sex steroid receptors contributes to the susceptibility to bacterial infections.\n\n Furthermore, this gender bias also depends on the effects of sex hormones on specific bacterial species.\n\n Finally, since a large number of genes related to immune functions are located on the X chromosome, X-linked mosaicism confers a highly polymorphic gene expression program that allows women to respond with a more expanded immune repertoire as compared with men.\n\n\nConclusion\nid='Par3'>Notwithstanding there is increasing evidence that confirms the sexual dimorphism in certain bacterial infections and the molecular mechanisms associated, further studies are required to clarify conflicting data and to determine the role of specific hormone receptors involved in the gender bias of bacterial infections, as well as their potential as therapeutic targets.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6011518","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

endocrinological changes at least twice during their lifetime, puberty and menopause, with many women undergoing an additional transition: pregnancy, which may or may not be accompanied by

Concentration-dependent effects of estrogen on the immune system; the role of progesterone, androgens, leptin, oxytocin, and prolactin; and the interplay between Th1 and Th2 immune responses together maintain a delicate balance between host defense, immunological tolerance and autoimmunity.\n In this review, multiple autoimmune diseases have been analyzed in the context of each of the three

(ERB-79) on the development of a tetanus toxoid (TT)-specific delayed type hypersensitivity response in wild type (WT) and in ER? - or ER?-deficient mice were investigated.\n\n Finally, EE and ERA-63 were tested for their immune modulating potential in established collagen induced arthritis in DBA/1J mice.\n\n Arthritis was followed for three weeks.\n\n Joint pathology was examined by histology and radiology.\n\n Local synovial cytokine production was analyzed using Luminex technology.\n\n Sera were assessed for COMP as a biomarker of cartilage destruction.\n\n\nResults\nEE was found to suppress clinical signs and symptoms in rat AA.\n\n The selective ER? agonist ERB-79 had no effect on arthritis symptoms in this model.\n\n In the TT-specific DTH model, EE and the selective ER? agonist ERA-63 suppressed the TT-specific swelling response in WT and ER?KO mice but not in ER?KO mice.\n\n As seen in the AA model, the selective ER? agonist ERB-79 did not suppress inflammation.\n\n Treatment with EE or ERA-63 suppressed clinical signs in collagen induced arthritis (CIA) in WT mice.\n\n This was associated with reduced inflammatory infiltrates and decreased levels of proinflammatory cytokines in CIA joints.\n\n\nConclusions\nER?, but not ER?, is key in ER-mediated suppression of experimental arthritis.\n\n It remains to be investigated how these findings translate to human autoimmune disease.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2911889","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

by excessive extracellular matrix deposition (ECM) with dermal and internal organ fibrosis.\n\n Considering the sex-based disparity in disease incidence, estradiol (E2), an estrogen form with pro-fibrotic effects, may play a role in SSc.\n\n We reported that post-menopausal women with diffuse cutaneous (dc)SSc have higher serum E2 levels compared to similar aged, healthy controls.\n\n Since males with SSc tend to have more severe disease, we examined serum E2 in dcSSc males in relation to disease characteristics and survival.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>We measured serum E2 in 83 dcSSc

In contrast to P4, E2 extensively affected the eSF DNA methylome and transcriptome.\n Importantly, E2 resulted in a more open versus closed chromatin, confirmed by histone modification analysis.\n Combined E2 with P4 affected a totally different landscape than E2 or P4 alone.\n ii) P4 responses were aberrant in early and late stage endometriosis, and mapping differentially methylated CpG sites with progesterone receptor targets from the literature revealed different but not decreased P4-targets, leading to question the P4-“resistant” phenotype in endometriosis.\n Interestingly, an aberrant E2-response was noted in eSF from endometriosis women; iii) Steroid hormones affected specific genomic contexts and locations, significantly enriching enhancers and intergenic regions and minimally involving proximal promoters and CpG islands, regardless of hormone type and eSF disease state.\n iv) In eSF from women with endometriosis, aberrant hormone-induced methylation signatures were mainly due to existing DNA methylation marks prior to hormone treatments and involved known endometriosis genes and pathways.\n v) Distinct DNA methylation and transcriptomic signatures revealed early and

0.05 versus controls).\n\n Compared with the control, recombinant human CCL2 was found to increase HEEC network formation (P &lt; 0.05) and neutralization of CCL2 in uNK conditioned media significantly decreased E2-dependent uNK-mediated network formation (P = 0.0006).\n\n\nLIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION\nOur results are based on in vitro responses of primary human cells and we cannot be certain that similar mechanisms occur in vivo in humans.\n\n Primary human uNK cells were isolated from first trimester decidua at a range of gestations (8–12 weeks), which may be a source of variation.\n\n Primary human uNK cells from non-pregnant endometrium were not assessed and therefore the responses of uNK cells to E2 treatment described in this study may be distinct to uNK cells from first trimester decidua.\n\n\nWIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS\nE2 is an essential regulator of reproductive competence.\n\n This study demonstrates a critical role for E2 in regulating cellular cross-talk within the endometrium during early pregnancy.\n\n We provide the first evidence that E2 directly regulates the function of human uNK cells by altering uNK cell migration and the secretion of uNK-derived angiogenic factors.\n\n We describe a novel mechanism of estrogen-dependent secretion of CCL2 which critically mediates uNK-dependent endometrial angiogenesis.\n\n Dysregulation of uNK cell function has been implicated in the aetiology of early implantation disorders and disorders of pregnancy.\n\n These novel findings provide unique insight into the regulation of uNK cell activity during the establishment of pregnancy in women and highlight key processes which may be targeted in future therapeutic strategies.\n\n\nSTUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S)\nStudies undertaken in the authors' laboratory were supported by MRC Programme Grant G1100356/1 to P.\n\nT.\n\nK.\n\nS.\n\n The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4498222","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Oxford University Press","authors":[{"firstname":"D.A.","surname":"Gibson","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"E.","surname":"Greaves","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"H.O.D.","surname":"Critchley","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"P.T.K.","surname":"Saunders","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.4049/jimmunol.171.1.37","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The uterine NK cell population requires IL-15 but these cells are not required for pregnancy nor the resolution of a Listeria monocytogenes infection","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1210/jcem.85.12.7023","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Progesterone Enhances Interleukin-15 Production in Human Endometrial Stromal Cells in Vitro1","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1007/s00281-007-0072-5","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The remission of rheumatoid arthritis during pregnancy","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJM199807303390501","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Rate of pregnancy-related relapse in multiple sclerosis.

of E2 as a primary conceptus signal in the pig has been questionable.\n Thus, the aim of the present study was to determine the effects of E2 on the porcine endometrial transcriptome in vivo and to compare these effects with transcriptome profiles on day 12 of pregnancy.\n Microarray analysis revealed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in response to E2 with overrepresented functional terms

common metabolic bone disease.\n Different effective treatments for osteoporosis are available.\n Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) at different doses rapidly normalizes turnover, preserves bone mineral density (BMD) at all skeletal sites, leading to a significant, reduction in vertebral and non-vertebral fractures.\n Tibolone, a selective tissue estrogenic activity regulator (STEAR), is effective in the treatment of vasomotor symptoms, vaginal atrophy and prevention/treatment of osteoporosis with a clinical efficacy similar to that of conventional HRT.\n Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) such as raloxifene and bazedoxifene reduce turnover and maintain or increase vertebral and femoral BMD and reduce the risk of osteoporotic fractures.\n The combination of bazedoxifene and conjugated estrogens, defined as tissue selective estrogen complex (TSEC), is able to reduce climacteric symptoms, reduce bone turnover and preserve BMD.\n In conclusion, osteoporosis prevention can actually be considered as a major additional benefit in climacteric women who use HRT for treatment of climacteric symptoms.\n The use of a standard dose of HRT for osteoporosis prevention is based on biology, epidemiology, animal and preclinical data, observational studies and randomized, clinical trials.\n The antifracture effect of a lower dose HRT or TSEC is supported by the data on BMD and turnover, with compelling scientific evidence.\n","id":"PMC4520366","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Termedia Publishing

Here, we report that the number of X chromosomes within cells also contributes to these sex differences.\n We employed a unique mouse model, known as the “four core genotypes,” to distinguish between effects of gonadal sex (testes or ovaries) and sex chromosomes (XX or XY).\n With this model, we produced gonadal male and female mice carrying XX or XY sex chromosome complements.\n Mice were gonadectomized to remove the acute effects of gonadal hormones and to uncover effects of sex chromosome complement on obesity.\n Mice with XX sex chromosomes (relative to XY), regardless of their type of gonad, had up to 2-fold increased adiposity and greater food intake during daylight hours, when mice are normally inactive.\n Mice with two X chromosomes also had accelerated weight gain on a high fat diet and developed fatty liver and elevated lipid and insulin levels.\n Further genetic studies with mice carrying XO and XXY chromosome complements revealed that the differences between XX and XY mice are attributable to dosage of the X chromosome, rather than effects of the Y chromosome.\n A subset of genes that escape X chromosome inactivation exhibited higher expression levels in adipose tissue and liver of XX compared to XY mice, and may contribute to the sex differences in obesity.\n Overall, our study is the first to identify sex chromosome complement, a factor distinguishing all
