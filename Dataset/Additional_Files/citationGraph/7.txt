Increasing age, co-morbid disease, and frailty are all associated with poor patient outcomes.   There are limited data describing outcomes amongst older patients with COVID-19 treated in ICU, and many aspects of the clinical management in this population remain unclear, including the optimal timing of tracheostomy. This issue is even more important considering the relation of frailty with not only increased need for tracheostomy, but also higher in-hospital mortality after tracheostomy among mechanically ventilated patients. \nIn patients who are expected to require prolonged mechanical ventilation, tracheostomy has several advantages, including reduced work of breathing, easier suctioning, reduced risk of accidental extubation, improved rehabilitation, oral hygiene, and patient comfort. To date, the optimal timing of tracheostomy has not been established. The evidence on mortality benefit from early tracheostomy is conflicting, with a significant variation in the direction and magnitude of effect between studies that assessed outcomes of patients requiring tracheostomy using different lengths of follow-up period. Indications for tracheostomy in COVID-19 are similar to the general critically ill population, but evidence about the risk/benefit ratio and the optimal timing for this procedure is lacking.\nAs part of a multicentre, prospective observational study of older mechanically ventilated patients, we studied the rate and timing of tracheostomy amongst critically ill patients with confirmed COVID-19. Our aim was to explore associations between tracheostomy rate and timing, and patient outcomes.\nMethods\nDesign and setting\nCOVID-19 disease in Very old Intensive care Patients (COVIP) was a prospective multicentre study that enrolled consecutive patients admitted to ICU with COVID-19, confirmed with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT 04321265). The aim of this study was to describe short-term outcomes of older critically ill patients with COVID-19. The secondary aim of the study was to investigate factors associated with outcomes in this population with a particular focus on frailty.   This study was a part of the very old intensive care patients (VIP) project (www.vipstudy.org) that had been endorsed by the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM). Patients included in this sub-study were recruited in 152 centres in 15 European countries and Israel from February 12 to December 31, 2020. The list of participating countries with numbers of centres and enrolled patients is available in Supplementary Table S1. National study co-ordinators were responsible for local ethics approvals, supervision of patient recruitment, and recruitment of ICUs. We were able to recruit patients without informed consent in some countries, whereas in the remaining countries informed consent was mandatory to include patients in the study (Supplementary Table S2).\nStudy population\nThis sub-study of the COVIP study included patients aged &gt;=70 yr with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to the ICU who required invasive mechanical ventilation. Patients previously enrolled in the COVIP study were excluded. We aimed to recruit as many patients as possible in this observational study, and no sample size calculation was performed. Each centre aimed to recruit at least 20 patients.\nData collection\nData were collected using an online case report form (CRF). All dates were numbered sequentially from the date of ICU admission. We recorded baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of study participants. The definitions of evaluated comorbidities are summarised in Supplementary Appendix 1. We gathered information about tracheostomy including timing of the procedure in days since ICU admission. Early tracheostomy was defined as performed &lt;=10 days since the tracheal intubation. This threshold was chosen by an international group of clinician-researchers within our study group. The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score was calculated on admission. Frailty level before disease onset was evaluated using the nine-level Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS),   and patients were categorised as fit (1-3 points), vulnerable (4 points), or frail (5-9 points). Patients were followed up until death or 3 months after ICU admission.\nPatient outcomes\nThe primary outcome measure was all-cause mortality within 3 months after admission to ICU. Secondary outcome measures were ICU length of stay and duration of mechanical ventilation. Data describing patient outcomes were retrieved from the hospital electronic patient record or by telephone follow-up.\nStatistical analysis\nCategorical variables are presented as numbers (percentage) and compared using chi test. Continuous variables are presented as medians with inter-quartile range (IQR) and compared using Mann-Whitney test. Differences in crude survival between the groups were evaluated using the log-rank test. To account for immortal time bias, we performed two complementary survival analyses. In the primary analysis, patients were included in the survival analysis from the day of tracheostomy. In addition, we performed a landmark analysis to account for selection bias. In this analysis we excluded all patients who died or were weaned from the ventilator within the first 10 days after tracheal intubation. Patients were divided into early and non-early tracheostomy groups, the latter including patients with late tracheostomy and those who were mechanically ventilated and never received tracheostomy. Proportional hazard Cox regression adjusting for age, sex, comorbidities, baseline CFS, and SOFA scores was performed to assess the association between tracheostomy timing and 3-month mortality in both analyses. A sensitivity analysis was performed using a multivariable model with tracheostomy timing as a continuous variable (number of days from intubation to tracheostomy) with restricted cubic splines (four knots located at the 5th, 35th, 65th, and 95th percentiles of the distribution) allowing for non-linearity in the relationship between the timing of tracheostomy and mortality. All models satisfied the proportional hazard assumption. Differences between the groups in duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay were compared in both univariate analysis (Mann-Whitney test) and multivariable analysis performed using linear regression adjusting for age, sex, comorbidities, baseline CFS, and SOFA scores. This was a complete case analysis; patients lost to follow-up were excluded. A two-sided P value &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed using R 3.2.3 software (R Development Core Team, Vienna, Austria).\nResults\nStudy population\nStudy flowchart.

Tracheostomy status was recorded in 2030 patients (97.7%). The final analysis was performed among patients with available data on 3-month survival status (1740/2030, 85.7%). The study flowchart is presented in Fig 1 . The mean age was 74 yr (IQR, 72-78) and males comprised 72.7% of the study group (1265/1740). The median SOFA score on admission was 6 (IQR, 4-8). Detailed information about patients' baseline demographic and clinical characteristics is presented in Table 1 .\nTracheostomy rate, timing, and characteristics of patients\nCleveland plot showing median time from tracheal intubation to tracheostomy and proportion of tracheostomy stratified by country. Time from intubation to tracheostomy is presented as median (dot) and inter-quartile range (whiskers). Proportion of patients who underwent tracheostomy is shown as a shade of blue.\nFig 2\nTracheostomy was performed in 461 (26.5%) patients, a median of 14 days (IQR, 9-20.5) from tracheal intubation. Tracheostomy rate varied between the countries and ranged from 8.3% in Ireland to 52.9% in Denmark. The median interval between intubation and tracheostomy also varied across countries and was lowest for Ireland (3 days) and the highest for the Netherlands and France (22 days). Tracheostomy was performed early (&lt;=10 days from intubation) in 29.3% patients (135/461), and this proportion ranged from 0.0% in Austria, Israel, Portugal, and Wales to 61.5% in England and 100.0% in Ireland (only one patient with tracheostomy included and one early tracheostomy recorded). Rates of tracheostomy, early tracheostomy, and median time from intubation to tracheostomy stratified by country are summarised in Fig 2 and Supplementary Table S1. Analysis of tracheostomy and early tracheostomy rates in each month of the study did not reveal any apparent temporal trend (Supplementary Fig. S2).\nUnivariable comparison of patients who did and did not receive a tracheostomy\nPatients with tracheostomy compared with those who received invasive mechanical ventilation, without tracheostomy, were more often male (77.0% vs 71.1%, P=0.018), were slightly younger (74.0 vs 75.0, P=0.008), less frequently suffered from congestive heart failure (10.3% vs 14.1%, P=0.046), and more frequently ventilated in the prone position (67.8% vs 52.6%, P&lt;0.001), vasopressors (95.7% vs 92.5%, P=0.028), renal replacement therapy (26.7% vs 19.4%, P=0.001), steroids (73.6% vs 61.7%, P&lt;0.001), and antibiotics (98.5% vs 94.8%, P=0.001). Three-month mortality was lower among patients with tracheostomy compared with other mechanically ventilated patients (50.3% vs 69.7%, log-rank P&lt;0.001).

The 3-month mortality in the analysed subgroup was 50.4% (227/450). We found no difference in 3-month mortality between early (defined as performed &lt;=10 days since the tracheal intubation) and late tracheostomy groups (52.6% vs 49.5%, log-rank P=0.9). A multivariable analysis did not demonstrate any effect of tracheostomy timing on 3-month mortality (hazard ratio [HR]=0.96; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.70-1.33). The landmark analysis revealed similar findings (HR=0.78; 95% CI, 0.57-1.06). Adjusted survival rate curves are presented in Fig. 3 . Detailed results of survival analysis in both primary and landmark analyses are summarised in Table 2 . Comparison of patients included in, and excluded from, the landmark analysis is presented in Supplementary Table S3. These findings were further confirmed by our sensitivity analysis, using a multivariable model with tracheostomy timing as a continuous variable, which showed no association between tracheostomy timing and 3-month mortality. Results of a sensitivity analysis evaluating an association of number of days between intubation and tracheostomy and 3-month mortality are presented in Supplementary Fig. S1. Duration of ICU length of stay and mechanical ventilation were assessed separately in primary and landmark analyses using linear regression adjusting for age, sex, comorbidities, baseline CFS, and SOFA scores. In the primary analysis, the early tracheostomy group was characterised by a shorter ICU length of stay (beta coefficient=-251.8 h; 95% CI, -352.6 to -151.0) and mechanical ventilation duration (beta coefficient=-225.4 h; 95% CI, -300.6 to -150.1) compared with the late tracheostomy group. Conversely, the landmark analysis showed no statistically significant association between the timing of tracheostomy and ICU length of stay (beta coefficient=44.2 h; 95% CI, -136.0 to 224.3) and mechanical ventilation duration (beta coefficient=25.7 h; 95% CI, -38.2 to 89.6).\nDiscussion\nIn this prospective observational study of mechanically ventilated patients with confirmed COVID-19 aged &gt;=70 yr, there was wide variation in tracheostomy rate and timing across participating countries. We did not find evidence that tracheostomy was associated with any advantage in terms of 3-month mortality, ICU length of stay, or duration of mechanical ventilation.\nEven though tracheostomy was introduced to ICUs in the 1950s, uncertainties around the procedure remain, particularly regarding indications for tracheostomy and optimal timing.   There is a lack of high-quality evidence to define the optimal use of tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients and concerns about the safety of medical personnel during this aerosol-generating procedure. Initial guidelines recommended that tracheostomy be preferably performed only in patients with a negative SARS-CoV-2 swab test, but it has been subsequently suggested that delaying tracheostomy beyond 14 days from the initial diagnosis may decrease the risk of transmitting the disease to healthcare workers.   Current guidelines issued by the American College of Chest Physicians state that tracheostomy is indicated in patients with COVID-19 in whom prolonged mechanical ventilation is expected, without the requirement to routinely test for SARS-CoV-2 before the procedure. We did not identify any temporal trends in the use of tracheostomy through the course of the pandemic. It is however possible that tracheostomy may have been performed more frequently when the number of hospitalised COVID-19 patients was lower.\nTracheostomy is performed in approximately 13% of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, making it one of the most common airway-related procedures in ICU. In this study tracheostomy was performed in about one-quarter of mechanically ventilated patients, which is consistent with previous reports of tracheostomy rates among critically ill COVID-19 patients, which range from 16.4% to 53.0%. Another interesting observation is a large variation of tracheostomy practices across the countries included in our study, as the frequency of tracheostomy ranged from 8.3% in Ireland to 52.9% in Denmark. The variation in tracheostomy timing was even greater. Similar analyses in the pre-COVID-19 era also suggested significant differences in tracheostomy practices around the world. Importantly, non-random selection of participating ICUs could have influenced this observation as the approach to tracheostomy may vary between both hospitals and countries. \nIn the majority of clinical scenarios, tracheostomy is considered in patients who have survived the acute phase of the disease and show signs of improvement, therefore giving hope for a positive outcome. It is therefore not surprising that our analysis showed that patients who underwent tracheostomy have a higher survival rate compared with the remaining mechanically ventilated patients. This also corroborates the results of a recently published meta-analysis suggesting that mortality is much lower amongst those COVID-19 patients who do receive a tracheostomy. \nAlthough the topic has been widely studied, the optimal timing of tracheostomy has not yet been established. There is no consensus definition for early tracheostomy, with cut-off points ranging from &lt;4 to &lt;=21 days. Observational studies are inherently prone to unmeasured confounding, whereas randomised trials are hindered by a high proportion of patients allocated to the late tracheostomy group who ultimately do not require the procedure. To account for both immortal time and selection bias, we performed two separate and complementary analyses, including landmark analysis. We have attempted to model this effect in our landmark analysis excluding patients who died or who were weaned from ventilation within 10 days from intubation, and may therefore not have been candidates for tracheostomy. Patients were divided into early and non-early tracheostomy group, with the latter including patients who did and did not undergo tracheostomy, providing a similar population to those included in intention-to-treat analyses in randomised trials.   Both survival analyses confirmed a lack of association between the timing of tracheostomy and 3-month survival for critically ill patients with COVID-19. The findings of meta-analyses including RCTs performed before the COVID-19 pandemic suggest that early tracheostomy is associated with a lower mortality amongst patients who require prolonged mechanical ventilation.   However, the evidence base for patients with COVID-19 consists solely of observational data. A recently published meta-analysis, including 203 patients with COVID-19 from three studies, did not show mortality benefit from early tracheostomy. Our sensitivity analysis with timing of tracheostomy evaluated as a non-linear continuous variable did not indicate any association between tracheostomy timing and 3-month mortality. However, this observation may be affected by the improved outcomes for patients who survive the immediate phase of COVID-19 within the first few days of ICU admission. It was important to undertake this sensitivity analysis because any definition of early vs late tracheostomy will inevitably be an arbitrary choice. This approach dichotomises the dataset leading to loss of information and an increased risk of bias. We therefore encourage readers to take all the complementary analyses into consideration while drawing conclusions from this study. In our opinion, this sensitivity analysis suggests that it is unlikely that the threshold selected in our study affected the conclusions in a meaningful way. However, the need remains to create a uniform definition of early tracheostomy to facilitate the research in this area.\nWith regard to the effect of tracheostomy timing on the duration of mechanical ventilation and duration of ICU stay, the existing evidence suggests that early tracheostomy increases the number of ventilator-free days and reduces the duration of ICU stay.   The primary analysis in our study showed that patients in the early tracheostomy group experienced shorter ICU stays and spent fewer hours on mechanical ventilation. However, this observation is subject to bias in the primary mortality analysis population. We undertook a landmark analysis to accounts for this source bias, the findings of which suggest there is no effect of tracheostomy timing and ICU stay or duration of mechanical ventilation after adjustment for potential confounders. Although a meta-analysis of previous studies including critically ill COVID-19 patients suggest that early tracheostomy is associated with a shorter ICU stay, these findings are limited by low patient numbers and the same source of bias described above.   \nThe main strength of our study is a large cohort of prospectively recruited patients with COVID-19 who underwent tracheostomy which significantly improves the quality of available evidence. Our study also has several limitations. The interpretations of observational studies evaluating timing of tracheostomy are inherently susceptible to immortal time bias and confounding. We aimed to minimise bias by including two complementary survival analyses. Our results cannot easily be generalised to the wider population of COVID-19 patients because the COVIP study only enrolled patients aged &gt;=70 yr. The low numbers of patients enrolled in some countries may result in a poor reflection of national tracheostomy practices. The consensus cut-off of &lt;=10 days that we used to define an early tracheostomy is by default arbitrary. At the same time, using a single threshold allowed us to emulate a clinical trial scenario in landmark analysis. To avoid missing relevant signals, we performed a sensitivity analysis where number of days to tracheostomy was treated as a continuous variable. Finally, we were not able to explore the effect of several factors, which may also alter patient outcomes including decannulation, sedation, time to mobilisation, incidence of delirium, and discharge destination.\nIn conclusion, this prospective observational study of mechanically ventilated patients aged &gt;=70 yr with COVID-19 showed wide variation in tracheostomy practices across Europe. Our findings do not show any effect of tracheostomy timing on patient mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, or ICU length of stay.\nAuthors' contributions\nGuarantor of the paper: WS\nAll authors made substantial contributions to the conception or design of the work; or the acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data for the work; drafted the work or revising it critically for important intellectual content; approved of the final version to be published; and agreed to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved.\nDeclarations of interest\nJCS declares that the Department of Intensive Care Medicine Bern has/had research and/or development/consulting contracts with (full disclosure): Orion Corporation, Abbott Nutrition International, B.

pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese

of the severity of coronavirus disease 2019: a model-based analysis","abstract":"Background\nIn the face of rapidly changing data, a range of case fatality ratio estimates for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been produced that differ substantially in magnitude.\n\n We aimed to provide robust estimates, accounting for censoring and ascertainment biases.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected individual-case data for patients who died from COVID-19 in Hubei, mainland China (reported by national and provincial health commissions to Feb 8, 2020), and for cases outside of mainland China (from government or ministry of health websites and media reports for 37 countries, as well as Hong Kong and Macau, until Feb 25, 2020).\n\n These individual-case data were used to estimate the time between onset of symptoms and outcome (death or discharge from hospital).\n\n We next obtained age-stratified estimates of the case fatality ratio by relating the aggregate distribution of cases to the observed cumulative deaths in China, assuming a constant attack rate by age and adjusting for demography and age-based and location-based under-ascertainment.\n\n We also estimated the case fatality ratio from individual line-list data on 1334 cases identified outside of mainland China.\n\n Using data on the prevalence of PCR-confirmed cases in international residents repatriated from China, we obtained age-stratified estimates of the infection fatality ratio.\n\n Furthermore, data on age-stratified severity in a subset of 3665 cases from China were used to estimate the proportion of infected individuals who are likely to require hospitalisation.\n\n\nFindings\nUsing data on 24 deaths that occurred in mainland China and 165 recoveries outside of China, we estimated the mean duration from onset of symptoms to death to be 17·8 days (95% credible interval [CrI] 16·9–19·2) and to hospital discharge to be 24·7 days (22·9–28·1).\n\n In all laboratory confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases from mainland China (n=70?117), we estimated a crude case fatality ratio (adjusted for censoring) of 3·67% (95% CrI 3·56–3·80).\n\n However, after further adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment, we obtained a best estimate of the case fatality ratio in China of 1·38% (1·23–1·53), with substantially higher ratios in older age groups (0·32% [0·27–0·38] in those aged &lt;60 years vs 6·4% [5·7–7·2] in those aged ?60 years), up to 13·4% (11·2–15·9) in those aged 80 years or older.\n\n Estimates of case fatality ratio from international cases stratified by age were consistent with those from China (parametric estimate 1·4% [0·4–3·5] in those aged &lt;60 years [n=360] and 4·5% [1·8–11·1] in those aged ?60 years [n=151]).\n\n Our estimated overall infection fatality ratio for China was 0·66% (0·39–1·33), with an increasing profile with age.\n\n Similarly, estimates of the proportion of infected individuals likely to be hospitalised increased with age up

syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19).\n\n Genomewide association analysis may allow for the identification of potential genetic factors involved in the development of Covid-19.\nMethods\nWe conducted a genomewide association study involving 1980 patients with Covid-19 and severe disease (defined as respiratory failure) at seven hospitals in the Italian and Spanish epicenters of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Europe.\n\n After quality control and the exclusion of population outliers, 835 patients and 1255 control participants from Italy and 775 patients and 950 control participants from Spain were included in the final analysis.\n\n In total, we analyzed 8,582,968 single-nucleotide polymorphisms and conducted a meta-analysis of the two case–control panels.\n\n\nResults\nWe detected cross-replicating associations with rs11385942 at locus 3p21.31 and with rs657152 at locus 9q34.2, which were significant at the

to high complication rates in patients with cardiometabolic diseases.\n\n Here, we identify risk factors and propose a clinical score to predict COVID-19 lethality, including specific factors for diabetes and obesity and its role in improving risk prediction.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe obtained data of confirmed and negative COVID-19 cases and their demographic and health characteristics from the General Directorate of Epidemiology of Mexican Ministry of Health.\n\n We investigated specific risk factors associated to COVID-19 positivity and mortality and explored the impact of diabetes and obesity on modifying COVID-19 related lethality.\n\n Finally, we built a clinical score to predict COVID-19 lethality.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAmong 177,133 subjects at May 18th, 2020, we observed 51,633 subjects with SARS-CoV-2 and 5,332 deaths.\n\n Risk factors for lethality in COVID-19 include early-onset diabetes, obesity, COPD, advanced age, hypertension, immunosuppression, and CKD; we observed that obesity mediates 49.5% of the effect of diabetes on COVID-19 lethality.\n\n Early-onset diabetes conferred an increased risk of hospitalization and obesity conferred an increased risk for ICU admission and intubation.\n\n Our predictive score for COVID-19 lethality included age ?65 years, diabetes, early-onset diabetes, obesity, age &lt;40 years, CKD, hypertension, and immunosuppression and significantly discriminates lethal from non-lethal COVID-19 cases (c-statistic=0.823).\n\n\nRESULTS\nHere, we propose a mechanistic approach to evaluate risk for complications and lethality attributable to COVID-19 considering the effect of obesity and diabetes in Mexico.\n\n Our score offers a clinical tool for quick determination of high-risk susceptibility patients in a first contact scenario.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7313944","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Oxford University Press","authors":[{"firstname":"Omar

declared as a pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2).\n\n It spreads very rapidly and can result in severe acute respiratory failure.\n\n The clinical studies have shown that advanced age and chronic diseases increase the risk of infection.\n\n However, influence of the blood groups on COVID-19 infection and its outcome remains to be confirmed.\n\n The aim of this study is to investigate whether there exists a relationship between the blood groups of the patients and risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the clinical outcomes in COVID-19

unit follow up and mortalities of the patients were analyzed retrospectively.\n\n 1881 healthy individuals, who presented to the Hacettepe University Blood Bank served as the controls.\n\n\nResults\n The most frequently detected blood group was blood group A (57%) amongst the COVID-19 patients.\n\n This was followed by blood group O (24.8%).\n\n The blood group types did not affect the clinical

models for diagnosis and prognosis of covid-19: systematic review and critical appraisal","abstract":"Objective\nTo review and critically appraise published and preprint reports of prediction models for diagnosing coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) in patients with suspected infection, for prognosis of patients with covid-19, and for detecting people in the general population at increased risk of becoming infected with covid-19 or being admitted to hospital with the disease.\n\n\nDesign\nLiving systematic review and critical appraisal.\n\n\nData sources\nPubMed and Embase through Ovid, Arxiv, medRxiv, and bioRxiv up to 7 April 2020.\nStudy selection\nStudies that developed or validated a multivariable covid-19 related prediction model.\n\n\nData extraction\nAt least two authors independently extracted data using the CHARMS (critical appraisal and data extraction for systematic reviews of prediction modelling studies) checklist; risk of bias was assessed using PROBAST (prediction model risk of bias assessment tool).\n\n\nResults\n4909 titles were screened, and 51 studies describing 66 prediction models were included.\n\n The review identified three models for predicting hospital admission from pneumonia and other events (as proxy outcomes for covid-19 pneumonia) in the general population; 47 diagnostic models for detecting covid-19 (34 were based on medical imaging); and 16 prognostic models for predicting mortality risk, progression to severe disease, or length of hospital stay.\n\n The most frequently reported predictors of presence of covid-19 included age, body temperature, signs and symptoms, sex, blood pressure, and creatinine.\n\n The most frequently reported predictors of severe prognosis in patients with covid-19 included age and features derived from computed tomography scans.\n\n C index estimates ranged from 0.73 to 0.81 in prediction models for the general population, from 0.65 to more than 0.99 in diagnostic models, and from 0.85 to 0.99 in prognostic models.\n\n All models were rated at high or unclear risk of bias, mostly because of non-representative selection of control patients, exclusion of patients who had not experienced the event of interest by the end of the study, high risk of model overfitting, and vague reporting.\n\n Most reports did not include any description of the study population or intended use of the models, and calibration of the model predictions was rarely assessed.\n\n\nConclusion\nPrediction models for covid-19 are quickly entering the academic literature to support medical decision making at a time when they are urgently needed.\n\n This review indicates that proposed models are poorly reported, at high risk of bias, and their reported performance is probably optimistic.\n\n Hence, we do not recommend any of these reported prediction models to be used in current practice.\n\n Immediate sharing of well documented individual participant data from covid-19 studies and collaboration are urgently needed to develop more rigorous prediction models, and validate promising ones.\n\n The predictors identified in included models should be considered as candidate predictors for new models.\n\n Methodological guidance should be followed because unreliable predictions could cause more harm than benefit in guiding clinical decisions.\n\n Finally, studies should adhere to the TRIPOD (transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis) reporting guideline.\n\n\nSystematic review registration\nProtocol

stratification of patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 using the ISARIC WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol: development and validation of the 4C Mortality Score","abstract":"Objective\nTo develop and validate a pragmatic risk score to predict mortality in patients admitted to hospital with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19).\n\n\nDesign\nProspective observational cohort study.\n\n\nSetting\nInternational Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infections Consortium (ISARIC) World Health Organization (WHO) Clinical Characterisation Protocol UK (CCP-UK) study (performed by the ISARIC Coronavirus Clinical Characterisation Consortium—ISARIC-4C) in 260 hospitals across England, Scotland, and Wales.\n\n Model training was performed on a cohort of patients recruited between 6 February and 20 May 2020, with validation conducted on a second cohort of patients recruited after model development between 21 May and 29 June 2020.\n\n\n\nParticipants\nAdults (age ?18 years) admitted to hospital with covid-19 at least four weeks before final data extraction.\n\n\nMain outcome measure\nIn-hospital mortality.\n\n\nResults\n35?463 patients were included in the derivation dataset (mortality rate 32.2%) and 22?361 in the validation dataset (mortality rate 30.1%).\n\n The final 4C Mortality Score included eight variables readily available at initial hospital assessment: age, sex, number of comorbidities, respiratory rate, peripheral oxygen saturation, level of consciousness, urea level, and C reactive protein (score range 0-21 points).\n\n The 4C Score showed high discrimination for mortality (derivation cohort: area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.79, 95% confidence interval 0.78 to 0.79; validation cohort: 0.77, 0.76 to 0.77) with excellent calibration (validation: calibration-in-the-large=0, slope=1.0).\n\n Patients with a score of at least 15 (n=4158, 19%) had a 62% mortality (positive predictive value 62%) compared with 1% mortality for those with a score of 3 or less (n=1650, 7%; negative predictive value 99%).\n\n Discriminatory performance was higher than 15 pre-existing risk stratification scores (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve range 0.61-0.76), with scores developed in other covid-19 cohorts often performing poorly (range 0.63-0.73).\n\n\nConclusions\nAn easy-to-use risk stratification score has been developed and validated based on commonly available parameters at hospital presentation.\n\n The 4C Mortality Score outperformed existing scores, showed utility to directly inform clinical decision making, and can be used to stratify patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 into different management groups.\n\n The score should be further validated to determine its applicability in other populations.\n\n\nStudy registration\nISRCTN66726260\n","id":"PMC7116472","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BMJ Publishing Group

been suggested to be used in various decision-making processes prior to and during an ICU admission.\n\n There are many instruments developed to assess frailty, but few of them can be used in emergency situations.\n\n In this setting the clinical frailty scale (CFS) is frequently used.\n\n The present study is a sub-study within a larger outcome study of elderly ICU patients in Europe (the VIP-2 study) in order to document the reliability of the CFS.\n\n\nMaterials and methods\nid='Par2'>From the VIP-2 study, 129 ICUs in 20 countries participated in this sub-study.\n\n The patients were acute admissions???80 years of age and frailty was assessed at admission by two independent observers using the CFS.\n\n Information was obtained from the patient, if not feasible, from the family/caregivers or from hospital files.\n\n The profession of the rater and source of data were recorded along with the score.\n\n Interrater variability was calculated using linear weighted kappa analysis.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>1923 pairs of assessors were included and background data of patients were similar to the whole cohort (n?=?3920).\n\n We found a very high inter-rater agreement (weighted kappa 0.86), also in subgroup analyses.\n\n The agreement when comparing information from family or hospital records was better than using only direct patient information, and pairs of raters from same profession performed better than from different professions.\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par4'>Overall, we documented a high reliability using CFS in this setting.\n\n This frailty score could be used more frequently in elderly ICU patients in order to create a more holistic and realistic impression of the patient´s condition prior to ICU admission.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7856616","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Springer International

survey","abstract":"Background\nAlthough tracheostomy is probably the most common surgical procedure performed on critically ill patients, it is unknown when a tracheostomy tube can be safely removed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed a cross-sectional survey of physicians and respiratory therapists with expertise in the management of tracheostomized patients at 118 medical centers to characterize contemporary opinions about tracheostomy decannulation practice and to define factors that influence these practices.\n\n\nResults\nWe surveyed 309 clinicians, of whom 225 responded (73%).\n\n Clinicians rated patient level of consciousness, ability to tolerate tracheostomy tube capping, cough effectiveness, and secretions as the most important factors in the decision to decannulate a patient.\n\n Decannulation failure was defined as the need to reinsert an artificial airway within 48 hours (45% of respondents) to 96 hours (20% of respondents) of tracheostomy removal, and 2% to 5% was the most frequent recommendation for an acceptable recannulation rate (44% of respondents).\n\n In clinical scenarios, clinicians who worked in chronic care facilities (30%) were less likely to recommend decannulation than clinicians who worked in weaning (47%), rehabilitation (53%), or acute care (55%) facilities (p = 0.015).\n\n Patients were most likely to be recommended for decannulation if they were alert and interactive (odds ratio [OR] 4.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.27 to 6.90; p &lt; 0.001), had a strong cough (OR 3.84, 95% CI 2.66 to 5.54; p &lt; 0.001), had scant thin secretions (OR 2.23, 95% CI 1.56 to 3.19; p &lt; 0.001), and required minimal supplemental oxygen (OR 2.04, 95% CI 1.45 to 2.86; p &lt; 0.001).\n\n\nConclusion\nPatient level of consciousness, cough effectiveness, secretions, and oxygenation are important determinants of clinicians' tracheostomy decannulation opinions.\n\n Most surveyed clinicians defined decannulation failure as the need to reinsert an artificial airway within 48 to 96 hours of planned tracheostomy removal.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2374629","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

ventilation","abstract":"Introduction\nPhysiological determinants of weaning success and failure are usually studied in ventilator-supported patients, comparing those who failed a trial of spontaneous breathing with those who tolerated such a trial and were successfully extubated.\n\n A major limitation of these studies was that the two groups may be not comparable concerning the severity of the underlying disease and the presence of comorbidities.\n\n In this physiological study, we assessed the determinants of weaning success in patients acting as their own control, once they are eventually liberated from the ventilator.\n\n\nMethods\nIn 30 stable tracheotomised ventilator-dependent patients admitted to a weaning center inside a respiratory intensive care unit, we recorded the breathing pattern, respiratory mechanics, inspiratory muscle function, and tension-time index of diaphragm (TTdi = Pdisw/Pdimax [that is, tidal transdiaphragmatic pressure over maximum transdiaphragmatic pressure] × Ti/Ttot [that is, the inspiratory time over the total breath duration]) at the time of weaning failure (T0).\n\n The measurements were repeated in all the patients (T1) either during a successful weaning trial (successful weaning [SW] group, n = 16) or 5 weeks later, in the case of repeated weaning failure (failed weaning [FW] group, n = 14).\n\n\nResults\nCompared to T0, in the FW group at T1, significant differences were observed only for a reduction in spontaneous breathing frequency and in TTdi (0.21 ± 0.122 versus 0.14 ± 0.054, P = 0.008).\n\n SW patients showed a significant increase in Pdimax (34.9 ± 18.9 cm H2O versus 43.0 ± 20.0, P = 0.02) and decrease in Pdisw/Pdimax (36.0% ± 15.8% versus 23.1% ± 7.9%, P = 0.004).\n\n\nConclusions\nThe recovery of an inadequate inspiratory muscle force could be the major determinant of 'late' weaning success, since this allows the patients to breathe far below the diaphragm fatigue threshold.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2717469","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

tracheostomized patients with restrictive pulmonary dysfunction.\n\n High-flow oxygen via tracheostomy supplies heated and humidified oxygen gas at &gt;?10 L/minute.\n\n However, little has been reported on the use of high-flow oxygen via tracheostomy during weaning from ventilators in patients with restrictive pulmonary dysfunction.\n\n We report successful weaning from ventilators in patients with restrictive pulmonary dysfunction using high-flow oxygen via tracheostomy.\n\n\nCase presentation\nid='Par2'>The first patient is a 78-year-old Japanese man with severe pneumococcal pneumonia who was mechanically ventilated for more than 1 month after esophagectomy for esophageal cancer.\n\n After he underwent tracheostomy because of prolonged mechanical ventilation, restrictive pulmonary dysfunction appeared: tidal volume 230–240 mL and static compliance 14–15 mL/cmH2O with 10 cmH2O pressure support ventilation.\n\n He was weaned from the ventilator under inspiratory support with high-flow oxygen via tracheostomy over a period of 16 days (flow at 40 L/minute and fraction of inspired oxygen of 0.25).\n\n The second patient is a 69-year-old Japanese man who developed aspiration pneumonia after esophagectomy and received prolonged mechanical ventilation via tracheostomy.\n\n He developed restrictive pulmonary dysfunction.\n\n High-flow oxygen via tracheostomy (flow at 40 L/minute with fraction of inspired oxygen of 0.25) was administered with measurement of the airway pressure and at the entrance of the tracheostomy tube.\n\n The measured values were as follows: 0.21–0.3 cmH2O, 0.21–0.56 cmH2O, 0.54–0.91 cmH2O, 0.76–2.01 cmH2O, 1.17–2.01 cmH2O, and 1.76–2.01 cmH2O at 10 L/minute, 20 L/minute, 30 L/minute, 40 L/minute, 50 L/minute, and 60 L/minute, respectively.\n\n The airway pressures were continuously positive and did not become negative even during inspiration, suggesting that high-flow oxygen via tracheostomy reduces inspiratory effort.\n\n He was weaned from the ventilator under inspiratory support with high-flow oxygen via tracheostomy over a period of 12 days.\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par3'>High-flow oxygen via tracheostomy may reduce the inspiratory effort and enhance tidal volume by delivering high-flow oxygen and facilitate weaning from prolonged mechanical ventilation in patients with restrictive pulmonary

intensive care unit procedure, needs to be evaluated.\n\n\nObjectives:\nA prospective study conducted in a tertiary care teaching hospital to find the late-onset speech and swallowing complications of tracheostomy in neurotrauma cases.\n\n\nMaterials and Methods:\nThis prospective observational study was conducted in the intensive care unit on intubated patients needing elective tracheostomy at a tertiary care teaching institute in South India with a dedicated referral trauma center.\n\n A data collection tool was prepared to find age, gender, date of admission, tracheostomy, and discharge, contact address and number, initial and final diagnosis, initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) on admission and subsequent GCS before and after tracheostomy, ventilator settings before and after the tracheostomy, procedure and intraoperative complications, type of cannula used, details of decannulation, and respiratory difficulties.\n\n\nResults:\nIn our study among 69 cases between 16 and 75 years' age range with mean 46.67 ± 16.65, majority were males (75.36%) and 60 were cranial cases (86.96%).\n\n Of the alive cases (21 [30.43%]) who underwent tracheostomy; 18 were performed in operation theater and 3 as bedside procedure.\n\n Major problems reported were: Speech problems (not able to phonate) (9), feeble voice (6), pain while speaking (6), and reduced loudness (6), frequent throat clearing while speaking (4), cough while speaking (3); breathlessness while speaking (1), gasping while speaking (1) and vocal tiredness (1); aspirations (2) and painful swallowing (1).\n\n\nConclusions:\nOur study suggested that though, majority of neurotrauma patients require tracheostomy for long term ventilator support and associated speech and swallowing problems are expected.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6020642","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Medknow Publications &amp; Media Pvt Ltd","authors":[{"firstname":"Valluri

Studies that reported a communication intervention with conscious nonverbal mechanically ventilated patients in the ICU aged 18 years or older were included.\n\n The methodological quality was assessed using the Quality Assessment Tool.\n\n\nResults\nThe search yielded 9883 publications, of which 31 articles, representing 29 different studies, fulfilled the inclusion criteria.\n\n The overall methodological quality varied from poor to moderate.\n\n We identified four communication intervention types: (1) communication boards were studied in three studies—they improved communication and increased patient satisfaction, but they can be time-consuming and limit the ability to produce novel utterances; (2) two types of specialized talking tracheostomy tubes were assessed in eight studies—audible voicing was achieved in the majority of patients (range 74–100 %), but more studies are needed to facilitate safe and effective use; (3) an electrolarynx improved communication in seven studies—its effectiveness was mainly demonstrated with tracheostomized patients; and (4) “high-tech” augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices in nine studies with diverse computerized AAC devices proved to be beneficial communication methods—two studies investigated multiple AAC interventions, and different control devices (e.\n\ng.\n\n, touch-sensitive or eye/blink detection) can be used to ensure that physical limitations do not prevent use of the devices.\n\n We developed an algorithm for the assessment and selection of a communication intervention with nonverbal and conscious mechanically intubated patients in the ICU.\n\n\nConclusions\nAlthough evidence is limited, results suggest that most communication methods may be effective in improving patient–healthcare professional communication with mechanically ventilated patients.\n\n A combination of methods is advised.\n\n We developed an algorithm to standardize the approach for selection of communication techniques.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13054-016-1483-2) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5070186","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"S.","surname":"ten Hoorn","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"P.

impact of frailty on survival in elderly intensive care patients with COVID-19: the COVIP study","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>The COVID-19 pandemic has led highly developed healthcare systems to the brink of collapse due to the large numbers of patients being admitted into hospitals.\n\n One of the potential prognostic indicators in patients with COVID-19 is frailty.\n\n The degree of frailty could be used to assist both the triage into intensive care, and decisions regarding treatment limitations.\n\n Our study sought to determine the interaction of frailty and age in elderly COVID-19 ICU patients.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>A prospective multicentre study of COVID-19 patients ??70 years admitted to intensive care in 138 ICUs from 28 countries was conducted.\n\n The primary endpoint was 30-day mortality.\n\n Frailty was assessed using the clinical frailty scale.\n\n Additionally, comorbidities, management strategies and treatment limitations were recorded.\n\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>The study included 1346 patients (28% female) with a median age of 75 years (IQR 72–78, range 70–96), 16.3% were older than 80 years, and 21% of the patients were frail.\n\n The overall survival at 30 days was 59% (95% CI 56–62), with 66% (63–69) in fit, 53% (47–61) in vulnerable and 41% (35–47) in frail patients (p?&lt;?0.001).\n\n In frail patients, there was no difference in 30-day survival between different age categories.\n\n Frailty was linked to an increased use of treatment limitations and less use of mechanical ventilation.\n\n In a model controlling for age, disease severity, sex, treatment limitations and comorbidities, frailty was independently associated with lower survival.\n\n\nConclusion\nid='Par4'>Frailty provides relevant prognostic information in elderly COVID-19 patients in addition to age and comorbidities.\n\n\nSupplementary Information\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at

from patients with an inferior clearance in terms of intensive care management and outcomes.\n This study analyzes a large collective with regards to baseline risk distribution and outcomes.\n Methods: In total, 3299 patients were included in this analysis, consisting of 1528 (46%) ?0% and 1771 (54%) &gt;0% patients.\n The primary endpoint was intensive care unit (ICU) mortality.\n Multilevel logistic regression analyses were used to compare both groups: A baseline model (model 1) with lactate clearance as a fixed effect and ICU as a random effect was installed.\n For model 2, patient characteristics (model 2) were included.\n For model 3, intensive care treatment (mechanical ventilation and vasopressors) was added to the model.\n Models 1 and 2 were used to evaluate the primary and secondary outcomes, respectively.\n Model 3 was only used to evaluate the primary outcomes.\n Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with respective 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated.\n Results: The cohorts had no relevant differences regarding the gender, BMI, age, heart rate, body temperature, and baseline lactate.\n Neither the primary infection focuses nor the ethnic background differed between both groups.\n In both groups, the most common infection sites were of pulmonary origin, the urinary tract, and the gastrointestinal tract.\n Patients with lactate clearance &gt;0% evidenced lower sepsis-related organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores (7 ± 6 versus 9 ± 6; p &lt; 0.001) and creatinine (1.53 ± 1.49 versus 1.80 ± 1.67; p &lt; 0.001).\n The ICU mortality differed significantly (14% versus 32%), and remained this way after multivariable adjustment for patient characteristics and intensive care treatment (aOR 0.43 95% CI 0.36–0.53; p &lt; 0.001).\n In the additional sensitivity analysis, the lack of lactate clearance was associated with a worse prognosis in each subgroup.\n Conclusion: In this large collective of septic patients, the 6 h lactate clearance is an independent method for outcome prediction.\n","id":"PMC7767189","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"Raphael

patients with sepsis.\n\n Recent studies suggest that lactate normalization during resuscitation is a more powerful indicator of resuscitative adequacy; however, early lactate clearance-guided therapy is still not recommended.\n\n We performed this meta-analysis to evaluate the effect of early lactate clearance-directed therapy as a potentially more effective resuscitation target.\n\n\nMethods:\nStudies were identified using PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library without region, publication type, or language restrictions.\n\n Randomized trials were included when they compared the efficacy and safety of lactate clearance-guided resuscitation versus central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2)-guided therapy.\n\n The primary outcome was mortality, and the secondary outcomes were intensive care unit (ICU) stay, length of hospital stay, mechanical ventilation time, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation-II (APACHE-II) score, and Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score.\n\n\nResults:\nSeven randomized controlled trials encompassing 1301 cases were reviewed.\n\n Compared with guided ScvO2 therapy, early lactate clearance-directed therapy was associated with decreased in-hospital mortality (relative ratio [RR] 0.68, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.56 to 0.82), shorter ICU stay (mean difference [MD] ?1.64 days, 95% CI ?3.23 to ?0.05), shorter mechanical ventilation time (MD ?10.22?hours, 95% CI ?15.94 to ?4.5), and lower APACHE-II scores (MD ?4.47, 95% CI ?7.25 to ?1.69).\n\n However, patients undergoing early lactate clearance-guided therapy had similar lengths of hospital stay and similar SOFA scores.\n\n\nConclusions:\nAs a specific indicator of resuscitation outcome, lactate clearance alone is superior to ScvO2 alone during a standard resuscitation paradigm.\n\n The optimal or desired rate of lactate clearance is still a contentious area.\n\n To guide resuscitation and normalize lactate levels in patients, repeating lactate measurements every 2 hours until the patient has met a lactate clearance of 10% or greater may be helpful.\n\n\nTrial registration number:\nPROSPERO

impact of frailty on survival in elderly intensive care patients with COVID-19: the COVIP study","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>The COVID-19 pandemic has led highly developed healthcare systems to the brink of collapse due to the large numbers of patients being admitted into hospitals.\n\n One of the potential prognostic indicators in patients with COVID-19 is frailty.\n\n The degree of frailty could be used to assist both the triage into intensive care, and decisions regarding treatment limitations.\n\n Our study sought to determine the interaction of frailty and age in elderly COVID-19 ICU patients.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>A prospective multicentre study of COVID-19 patients ??70 years admitted to intensive care in 138 ICUs from 28 countries was conducted.\n\n The primary endpoint was 30-day mortality.\n\n Frailty was assessed using the clinical frailty scale.\n\n Additionally, comorbidities, management strategies and treatment limitations were recorded.\n\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>The study included 1346 patients (28% female) with a median age of 75 years (IQR 72–78, range 70–96), 16.3% were older than 80 years, and 21% of the patients were frail.\n\n The overall survival at 30 days was 59% (95% CI 56–62), with 66% (63–69) in fit, 53% (47–61) in vulnerable and 41% (35–47) in frail patients (p?&lt;?0.001).\n\n In frail patients, there was no difference in 30-day survival between different age categories.\n\n Frailty was linked to an increased use of treatment limitations and less use of mechanical ventilation.\n\n In a model controlling for age, disease severity, sex, treatment limitations and comorbidities, frailty was independently associated with lower survival.\n\n\nConclusion\nid='Par4'>Frailty provides relevant prognostic information in elderly COVID-19 patients in addition to age and comorbidities.\n\n\nSupplementary Information\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at

surrounding them, yet there is little information available on indoor air quality and factors affecting it within a PICU.\n To address this gap in knowledge we conducted continuous indoor and outdoor airborne particle concentration measurements over a two-week period at the Royal Children's Hospital PICU in Brisbane, Australia, and we also collected 82 bioaerosol samples to test for the presence of bacterial and viral pathogens.\n Our results showed that both 24-hour average indoor particle mass (PM10) (0.6–2.2 ?g m? 3, median: 0.9 ?g m? 3) and submicrometer particle number (PN) (0.1–2.8 × 103 p cm? 3, median: 0.67 × 103 p cm? 3) concentrations were significantly lower (p &lt; 0.01) than the outdoor concentrations (6.7–10.2 ?g m? 3, median: 8.0 ?g m? 3 for PM10 and 12.1–22.2 × 103 p cm? 3, median: 16.4 × 103 p cm? 3 for PN).\n In general, we found that indoor particle concentrations in the PICU were mainly affected by indoor particle sources, with outdoor particles providing a negligible background.\n We identified strong indoor particle sources in the PICU, which occasionally increased indoor PN and PM10 concentrations from 0.1 × 103 to 100 × 103 p cm? 3, and from 2 ?g m? 3 to 70 ?g m? 3, respectively.\n The most substantial indoor particle sources were nebulization therapy, tracheal suction and cleaning activities.\n The average PM10 and PN emission rates of nebulization therapy ranged from 1.29 to 7.41 mg min? 1 and from 1.20 to 3.96 p min? 1 × 1011, respectively.\n Based on multipoint measurement data, it was found that particles generated at each location could be quickly transported to other locations, even when originating from isolated single-bed rooms.\n The most commonly isolated bacterial genera from both primary and broth cultures were skin commensals while viruses were rarely identified.\n Based on the findings from the study, we developed a set of practical recommendations for PICU design, as well as for medical and cleaning staff to mitigate aerosol generation and transmission to minimize infection risk to PICU

Influenza A H1N1 (2009)) is a significant concern for public health policy makers.\n\n World Health Organization (WHO)-defined ‘aerosol generating procedures’ (AGPs) are thought to increase the risk of aerosol transmission to HCWs, but there are presently insufficient data to quantify risk accurately or establish a hierarchy of risk-prone procedures.\n\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nThis study measured the amount of H1N1 (2009) RNA in aerosols in the vicinity of H1N1 positive patients undergoing AGPs to help quantify the potential risk of transmission to HCWs.\n\n There were 99 sampling occasions (windows) producing a total of 198 May stages for analysis in the size ranges 0.86–7.3 µm.\n\n Considering stages 2 (4–7.3 µm) and 3 (0.86–4 µm) as comprising one sample, viral RNA was detected in 14 (14.1%) air samples from 10 (25.6%) patients.\n\n Twenty three air samples were collected while potential AGPs were being performed of which 6 (26.1%) contained viral RNA; in contrast, 76 May samples were collected when no WHO 2009 defined AGP was being performed of which 8 (10.5%) contained viral RNA (unadjusted OR?=?2.84 (95% CI 1.11–7.24) adjusted OR?=?4.31 (0.83–22.5)).\n\n\nConclusions/Significance\nWith our small sample size we found that AGPs do not significantly increase the probability of sampling an H1N1 (2009) positive aerosol (OR (95% CI)?=?4.31 (0.83–22.5).\n\n Although the probability of detecting positive H1N1 (2009) positive aerosols when performing various AGPs on intensive care patients above the baseline rate (i.\n\ne.\n\n in the absence of AGPs) did not reach significance, there was a trend towards hierarchy of AGPs, placing bronchoscopy and respiratory and airway suctioning above baseline (background) values.\n\n Further, larger studies are required but these preliminary findings may be of benefit to infection control teams.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3571988","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7092819","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical Society","authors":[{"firstname":"Wei-jie","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng-yi","surname":"Ni","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng-yi","surname":"Ni","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yu","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wen-hua","surname":"Liang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chun-quan","surname":"Ou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jian-xing","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Shan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chun-liang","surname":"Lei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"David S.C.","surname":"Hui","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Du","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lan-juan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guang","surname":"Zeng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kwok-Yung","surname":"Yuen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ru-chong","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chun-li","surname":"Tang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tao","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ping-yan","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jie","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shi-yue","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jin-lin","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zi-jing","surname":"Liang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi-xiang","surname":"Peng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Li","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ya-hua","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Peng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jian-ming","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ji-yang","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhong","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gang","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhi-jian","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shao-qin","surname":"Qiu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jie","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chang-jiang","surname":"Ye","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shao-yong","surname":"Zhu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nan-shan","surname":"Zhong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"WHO Director-General's opening remarks at the media briefing on COVID-19: 11 March 2020.

radiological (CT scan) markers of COVID-19, and with negative nasopharyngeal sample within 24 h of surgery, are at low risk of being infected.\n Instructions for personal protection include specific wound dressings and decontamination of all material used.\n The operating room should be ventilated after each tracheostomy and the pressure of the room should be neutral or negative.\n Percutaneous tracheostomy is to be preferred over surgical cervicotomy in order to reduce aerosolization and to avoid moving patients from the intensive care unit to the operating room.\n Ventilation must be optimized during the procedure, to limit patient oxygen desaturation.\n Drug assisted neuromuscular blockage is advised to reduce coughing during tracheostomy tube insertion.\n An experienced team is

Three different clinical evolutions are described: (1) two paucisymptomatic women diagnosed within a day of exhibiting symptoms, with high nasopharyngeal titres of SARS-CoV-2 within the first 24 h of the illness onset (5·2 and 7·4 log10 copies per 1000 cells, respectively) and viral RNA detection in stools; (2) a two-step disease progression in two young men, with a secondary worsening around 10 days after disease onset despite a decreasing viral load in nasopharyngeal samples; and (3) an 80-year-old man with a rapid evolution towards multiple organ failure and a persistent high viral load in lower and upper respiratory tract with systemic virus dissemination and virus detection in plasma.\n\n The 80-year-old patient died on day 14 of illness (Feb 14, 2020); all other patients had recovered and been discharged by Feb 19, 2020.\nInterpretation\nWe illustrated three different clinical and biological types of evolution in five patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 with detailed and comprehensive viral sampling strategy.\n\n We believe that these findings will contribute to a better understanding of the natural history of the disease and will contribute to advances in the implementation of more efficient infection control strategies.\n\n\nFunding\nREACTing (Research &amp; Action Emerging Infectious Diseases).\n\n\n","id":"PMC7156120","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Francois-Xavier","surname":"Lescure","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lila","surname":"Bouadma","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Duc","surname":"Nguyen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Marion","surname":"Parisey","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Paul-Henri","surname":"Wicky","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sylvie","surname":"Behillil","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Alexandre","surname":"Gaymard","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Maude","surname":"Bouscambert-Duchamp","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Flora","surname":"Donati","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Quentin","surname":"Le Hingrat","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Vincent","surname":"Enouf","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nadhira","surname":"Houhou-Fidouh","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Martine","surname":"Valette","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alexandra","surname":"Mailles","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jean-Christophe","surname":"Lucet","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"France","surname":"Mentre","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xavier","surname":"Duval","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Diane","surname":"Descamps","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Denis","surname":"Malvy","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jean-François","surname":"Timsit","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bruno","surname":"Lina","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sylvie","surname":"van-der-Werf","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yazdan","surname":"Yazdanpanah","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"COVID-19: Guidance about Using Personal Protective Equipment.

(4–42 days) since orotracheal intubation.\n\n A close follow-up of 1616/1890 (85.5%) patients at the cut-off time of 1-month follow-up showed that in 842 (52.1%) patients, weaning was achieved, while 391 (24.2%) were still under mechanical ventilation and 383 (23.7%) patients had died from COVID-19. Decannulation among those in whom weaning was successful (n?=?842) was achieved in 683 (81%) patients.\n\n\nConclusion\nid='Par4'>To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest cohort of COVID-19 patients undergoing tracheostomy.\n\n The critical focus is the unprecedented amount of tracheostomies: 1890 in 7 weeks.\n\n Weaning could be achieved in over half of the patients with follow-up.\n\n Almost one out of four tracheotomized patients died from COVID-19.\n","id":"PMC7399582","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Springer Berlin

ventilation.\n\n Tracheostomy is not recommended by current guidelines as it is considered a superspreading event owing to aerosolization that unduly risks health care workers.\n\n\nMethods\nPatients with severe COVID-19 who were on mechanical ventilation for 5 days or longer were evaluated for percutaneous dilational tracheostomy.\n\n We developed a novel percutaneous tracheostomy technique that placed the bronchoscope alongside the endotracheal tube, not inside it.\n\n That improved visualization during the procedure and continued standard mechanical ventilation after positioning the inflated endotracheal tube cuff in the distal trachea.\n\n This technique offers a significant mitigation for the risk of virus aerosolization during the procedure.\n\n\nResults\nFrom March 10 to April 15, 2020, 270 patients with COVID-19 required invasive mechanical ventilation at New York University Langone Health Manhattan’s campus; of those, 98 patients underwent percutaneous dilational tracheostomy.\n\n The mean time from intubation to the procedure was 10.6 ± 5 days.\n\n Currently, 32 patients (33%) do not require mechanical ventilatory support, 19 (19%) have their tracheostomy

often performed for prolonged endotracheal intubation in critically ill patients.\n\n However, in the context of COVID-19, tracheostomy placement pathways have been altered due to the poor prognosis of intubated patients and the risk of transmission to providers through this highly aerosolizing procedure.\n\n\nMethods:\nA prospective single-system multi-center observational cohort study was

intubation to surgery was 7 (range 2-17) days.\n\n Fifteen (34.1%)\npatients died during the follow-up period (median 22 days, range 8-68) after\nthe intubation.\n\n Weaning from the ventilator was first attempted on median\n25th day (range 13-43) from orotracheal intubation.\n\n A median of 35 (range\n18-79) days was required to complete weaning.\n\n Median duration of ICU stay\nwas 22 (range

strategy and optimal timing of tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19: Early experiences in Japan","abstract":"Objective\nTracheostomy is an important surgical procedure for coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) patients who underwent prolonged tracheal intubation.\n\n Surgical indication of tracheostomy is greatly affected by the general condition of the patient, comorbidity, prognosis, hospital resources, and staff experience.\n\n Thus, the optimal timing of tracheostomy remains controversial.\n\n\nMethods\nWe reviewed our early experience with COVID-19 patients who underwent tracheostomy at one tertiary hospital in Japan from February to September 2020 and analyzed the timing of tracheostomy, operative results, and occupational infection in healthcare workers (HCWs).\n\n\nResults\nOf 16 patients received tracheal intubation with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, five patients (31%) received surgical tracheostomy in our hospital.\n\n The average consultation time for surgical tracheostomy was 7.4 days (range, 6 - 9 days) from the COVID-19 team to the otolaryngologist.\n\n The duration from tracheal intubation to tracheostomy ranged from 14 to 27 days (average, 20 days).\n\n The average time of tracheostomy was 27 min (range, 17 - 39 min), and post-wound bleeding occurred in only one patient.\n\n No significant differences in hemoglobin (Hb) levels were found between the pre- and postoperative periods (mean: 10.2 vs.\n\n 10.2 g/dl, p = 0.93).\n\n Similarly, no difference was found in white blood cell (WBC) count (mean: 12,200 vs.\n\n 9,900 cells /µl, p = 0.25).\n\n After the tracheostomy, there was no occupational infection among the HCWs who assisted the tracheostomy patients during the perioperative period.\n\n\nConclusion\nWe proposed a modified weaning protocol and surgical indications of tracheostomy for COVID-19 patients and recommend that an optimal timing for tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients of 2 - 3 weeks after tracheal intubation, from our early experiences in Japan.\n\n An experienced multi-disciplinary tracheostomy team is essential to perform a safe tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19 and to minimize the risk of occupational infection in HCWs.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7674116","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Society of Japan Inc.

circuit to attach the patient to the theatre ventilator.\n We explain our technique to reduce secretion spillage when opening the trachea.\n We emphasise the importance of closed tracheal suctioning and mouth suctioning prior to patient transfer.\n We highlight the importance of maintaining a closed circuit throughout the procedure and describe tips on how to achieve this.\n We summarise the

anxiety, agitation and/or pain.\n\n Current opinion is that tracheotomy reduces sedation requirements.\n\n We determined sedation needs before and after tracheotomy of intubated and mechanically ventilated patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed a retrospective analysis of the use of morphine, midazolam and propofol in patients before and after tracheotomy.\n\n\nResults\nOf 1,788 patients admitted to our intensive care unit during the study period, 129 (7%) were tracheotomized.\n\n After the exclusion of patients who received a tracheotomy before or at the day of admittance, 117 patients were left for analysis.\n\n The daily dose (DD; the amount of sedatives for each day) divided by the mean daily dose (MDD; the mean amount of sedatives per day for the study period) in the week before and the week after tracheotomy was 1.07 ± 0.93 DD/MDD versus 0.30 ± 0.65 for morphine, 0.84 ± 1.03 versus 0.11 ± 0.46 for midazolam, and 0.62 ± 1.05 versus 0.15 ± 0.45 for propofol (p &lt; 0.01).\n\n However, when we focused on a shorter time interval (two days before and after tracheotomy), there were no differences in prescribed doses of morphine and midazolam.\n\n Studying the course in DD/MDD from seven days before the placement of tracheotomy, we found a significant decline in dosage.\n\n From day -7 to day -1, morphine dosage (DD/MDD) declined by 3.34 (95% confidence interval -1.61 to -6.24), midazolam dosage by 2.95 (-1.49 to -5.29) and propofol dosage by 1.05 (-0.41 to -2.01).\n\n After tracheotomy, no further decrease in DD/MDD was observed and the dosage remained stable for all sedatives.\n\n Patients in the non-surgical and acute surgical groups received higher dosages of midazolam than patients in the elective surgical group.\n\n Time until tracheotomy did not influence sedation requirements.\n\n In addition, there was no significant difference in sedation between different patient groups.\n\n\nConclusion\nIn our intensive care unit, sedation requirements were not further reduced after tracheotomy.\n\n Sedation requirements were already sharply declining before tracheotomy was performed.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1751026","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Denise

Although substantial variation in the type and timing of this procedure has been reported, some studies have suggested that performing an early tracheotomy (ET) may reduce the lengths of IMV and ICU care required. \nAbout 3% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 suffer from respiratory failure and require IMV. Tracheotomy is therefore the most frequent surgical procedure performed during lockdowns for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The main indications for a tracheotomy are long-term intubation, management of secretions, sedation reduction needs, progression to weaning, and prevention of laryngeal edema. Tracheotomy in these patients minimizes the long-term risk of laryngotracheal stenosis and reduces the lengths of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay. This last aspect is crucial when ICU space is under strain.\nEarly in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, there were concerns that performing a tracheotomy could put the surgical team at risk of infection. Some centers were unable to perform the procedure as they lacked adequate personal protective equipment (PPE). Published high mortality rates and the difficulties and risks of transferring patients from the ICU to the operation room were also drawbacks. Many scientific societies issued guidelines and recommendations so that the procedure could be performed safely for both patient and surgeon. Many of the recommendations were based on the experience gained from SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome and drew on the opinions of expert surgeons and epidemiologists. As it was believed that it would be safer to perform the procedure when the patient's viral load was lower, many guidelines recommended late or very late tracheotomy (LT). However, guidance disagreed on which type of tracheotomy was safest (open surgical vs. percutaneous) or where it should be performed. All guidelines agreed that maneuvers generating aerosols should be minimized at the time of tracheal entrance to protect surgical teams. \nPreliminary data from different centers during the pandemic showed that a tracheotomy could be performed safely, even at the patient's bedside, if the standard PPE recommendations were followed. The complication rates under this scenario seemed to be similar to those reported before the pandemic. Some data suggested that ET might reduce time to weaning and ICU length of stay. \nWe therefore evaluated the effect of disease- and tracheotomy-related variables on the weaning and mortality rates in a large multicenter cohort of COVID-19 ICU patients that required a tracheotomy during IMV. The study was performed in Spain during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and focused on determining the optimal time to perform a tracheotomy for these patients.\nMETHODS\nStudy design and setting\nWe used a prospective cohort study design. All patients receiving a tracheotomy between March 11, 2020 and July 20, 2020 in 36 hospitals who met the inclusion criteria were included. Fifty patients of the series have been reported elsewhere. \nA data collection proposal was sent to all members of the Spanish Society of Otorhinolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery by the senior author (F. X. A.-J.). Thirty-six hospitals showed interest. Researchers from each hospital collected the data from ICU admission to weaning/death/end of study and filled in on an MS Excel sheet (MS Excel for mac v16.16.27. Microsoft 2018) sent to each center at the beginning of study. Once the recruitment period was over, each hospital sent the database anonymously to the coordinator (F. X. A.-J.) via a secure server. Treatment, weaning criteria, and sedation agents were not standardized among centers.\nInclusion and exclusion criteria\nPatients suffering from respiratory failure caused by SARS CoV-2 infection, confirmed by polymerase chain reaction, requiring IMV and subsequent tracheotomy, performed before July 20, 2020 were included.\nPatients with a missing tracheotomy, orotracheal intubation, or outcome date or missing age or sex were excluded. Following our target trial framework, we excluded patients with a tracheotomy performed in the first 7 days after orotracheal intubation.\nTarget trial and follow-up\nWe used a trial emulation framework to minimize confounding and bias. Our exposure was ET or LT. Our decision time (D7) was 7 days after the initiation of IMV (D0), when we expect a decision of whether a patient should have a tracheotomy to be made and when we would expect to randomize in a randomized trial. All baseline characteristics were considered before or on this date. As all of the study participants received a tracheotomy, an intention-to-treat analysis was impossible, and we instead used a per-protocol analysis. We followed up participants from the day of the tracheotomy (T0) until death, weaning, or the end of July 20, 2020, whichever was sooner. Participants who had not died or weaned by this date were then censored. Figure 1 describes these timings.\nTarget trial description. OTI, orotracheal intubation; PAFI, PaO2/FiO2 ratio; PEEP, positive end-expiratory pressure [Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]\nStudy outcome\nThe main outcome was time to weaning, defined as days from tracheotomy to weaning from IMV. Secondary outcomes included death, defined as days from tracheotomy to death, and rates of intraoperative bleeding (excessive bleeding that difficult standard tracheotomy or requiring additional hemostatic measures), postoperative bleeding (bleeding that required revision of stoma) and ventilatory complications (air leak).\nExposures and measurements\nThe main exposure variable was ET versus LT. &quot;Early&quot; was defined as occurring on Day 7-10 after orotracheal intubation, and &quot;late&quot; as on Day 11 or later. Sex and year of birth were acquired at hospital admission. We selected the comorbidities that were most likely to be risk factors for COVID-19 based on previous literature. We included hypertensive disease, immunosuppression, heart failure, autoimmune disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pregnancy, diabetes mellitus, neuromuscular disease, and ischemic heart disease. We registered the start and end days of pronation cycles. We obtained measures of the PaO2/FiO2 ratio (PAFI) and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at intubation (D0), 7 days after intubation (decision date, D7), and at tracheotomy (T0). APACHE II and SOFA scores were obtained at ICU admission. We collected the international normalized ratio (INR), use of anticoagulants, use of vasoactive drugs, presence of secretion problems, and indication at surgery. We also collected total lymphocyte and leukocyte count, INR, D-dimer, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, and C-reactive protein at admission. These variables are obtained from the electronic medical records, which included analytical parameters, dates of procedures, and ventilatory parameters.\nEthical approval and informed consent\nThe local ethics committee approved the study protocol and waved informed consent given the observational nature of the study.\nStatistical analysis\nWe calculated the proportion or mean and SD of each variable for the population as a whole and stratified by exposure and included/excluded status. We computed weekly and total incidence rates (events per 100 person-day) of weaning and death overall and stratified by ET versus LT. We plotted cumulative incidence curves of weaning and death by exposure. We fitted a multivariable Cox model to estimate cause-specific hazard ratios (csHRs) of weaning and death for ET versus LT.\nWe fitted multivariable Poisson models to estimate the relative risk of intraoperative and postoperative bleeding and ventilatory complications. All models were repeat-adjusted for age and sex. All models were further adjusted for age, sex, PAFI, PEEP, anticoagulant use, and pronation days.\nMissing PAFI, PEEP, APACHE II, anticoagulant use, and comorbidity data were imputed using multiple imputation with chained equations. We used predictive mean matching with 5 k nearest neighbors for continuous variables and logistic models dichotomic variables, generating 100 imputed data sets. We pooled estimators using Rubin's rules. \nWe tested for interactions between tracheotomy timing and age, sex, APACHE II, SOFA, PEEP, PAFI, and days of pronation. We compared the participants in the ET group who did and did not wean within 14 days of intubation.\nWe performed data management in SPSS 27 (IBM Corp. Released 2020. IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 27.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp). We performed all analyses in STATA version 16.0 (StataCorp. 2019. Stata Statistical Software: Release 16. College Station, TX: StataCorp LLC).\nStudy report\nWe followed the reporting guidelines of the STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) statement for cohort studies. \nRESULTS\nOf 794 possible participants, 98 were excluded. Figure 2 shows the flow of patients and numbers included and excluded for each criterion.

Participants with LTs had more total days of pronation (9.5 days for late vs. 6.8 for early) and more often had their last pronation cycle before tracheotomy (50% for late and 33% for early). The proportion of participants pronated in the first 7 days after orotracheal intubation and how many days these participants were pronated were similar in the LT and ET groups.\nThe ET group weaned more quickly than the late group (Table 2). The median follow-up time from tracheotomy to weaning or death was 13 days for LT and 12 days for ET. Among those who were successfully weaned, participants with an ET was seen 11 days of weaning since tracheotomy and 19 days since orotracheal intubation, whereas LT group was seen 12 days and 29 days, respectively.\nDays to weaning by tracheotomy timing, since orotracheal intubation and since tracheotomy\n	Early tracheotomy	Late tracheotomy	 	Median	p25	p75	Median	p25	p75	 	Days to weaning or death or censoring	 	Since tracheotomy (T0)	12	6	22	13	7	26	 	Since decision (D7)	13	8	24	23	16	37	 	Since orotracheal intubation (D0)	20	15	31	30	23	44	 	Days to weaning (those who wean)	 	Since tracheotomy (T0)	11	6	17	12	7	21	 	Since decision (D7)	12	8	20	22	16	33	 	Since orotracheal intubation (D0)	19	15	27	29	23	40	 	Days to death (those who die)	 	Since tracheotomy (T0)	13	7	23	14	7	25	 	Since decision (D7)	16	9	26	24	17	35	 	Since orotracheal intubation (D0)	23	16	33	31	24	42	 	\nThe LT group had a lower rate of successful weaning: 360 of the 554 participants in the LT group were weaned before the end of follow-up (3.1 patients weaning per 100 patient-days [2.8-3.4]), whereas 102 out of 142 were weaned in the ET group (3.9 patients weaning per 100 patient-days [3.1-4.7]).

Our results suggest that ET leads to similar or faster weaning without increased complications or mortality. When clinically appropriate, the ET strategy might therefore be preferable, as it can release ICU space.\nThe optimal timing of tracheotomy may be influenced by many factors, such as the initial cause of IMV, the severity of the disease, neurological status, complications, and the possibility of recovery. In the COVID-19 scenario, the initial cause of IMV is always severe respiratory failure, which may have high pronation requirements and be complicated by systemic failure, thrombosis, or other COVID-19-related conditions.\nMany consensus documents were published in 2020 on best practices for tracheotomy in critically ill COVID-19 patients, generally aiming to prevent surgeon infection. Most recommended delayed tracheotomy, while others focused on the type of tracheotomy, the necessary protective equipment, or where best to perform a tracheotomy. Almost no existing guidance evaluated which clinical parameters influence weaning outcomes, total days of IMV, or mortality.\nBier-Laning et al. analyzed the tracheotomy protocols and practices put in place by 29 institutions around the world in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. They found insufficient evidence for recommending a specific timing for tracheotomy in COVID-19-related respiratory failure. Tornari et al. conducted an observational cohort study to understand the factors that influenced the trajectory from tracheotomy to decannulation to facilitate ICU capacity planning and improve outcomes. Higher FiO2 at tracheotomy time and higher pretracheotomy peak cough flow were associated with longer delays in decannulation of COVID-19 tracheotomy patients. \nRecent publications have suggested that earlier tracheotomy might facilitate the weaning process and reduce the length of mechanical ventilation required. Aviles-Jurado et al. evaluated 50 consecutive patients that required tracheotomy in the first wave of the pandemic in Spain in one single center. ET reduced the duration of IMV by reducing the days between orotracheal intubation and the tracheotomy procedure, releasing ICU beds for other patients. Our multicenter study of 696 tracheotomized patients from the first wave of COVID-19 confirms their preliminary findings. We found a 31% (2%-81%) reduction in the time from orotracheal intubation to weaning when tracheotomy was performed early (fully adjusted HR [95% CI]: 1.31 [1.02-1.81]), without increasing complications or mortality rates.\nThe ideal timing for a tracheotomy in patients receiving IMV also remains controversial in other disease scenarios, despite decades of experience of using this technique. Two large randomized prospective studies addressing this topic have been published so far. Terragni et al. randomized 419 patients to ET (6-9 days of intubation) or LT (13-15 days of intubation). They found no differences in complications, pneumonia associated with mechanical ventilation or mortality at 28 days of intubation. Young et al. randomized 909 patients to early (within 10 days of intubation) or LT (after 10 days of intubation) and also found no difference in mortality. Neither of these randomized controlled trials examined the days of mechanical ventilation as an outcome. Our results agree with the trials' finding of no difference in mortality between ET and LT, but we also found a 31% reduction in IMV duration in the ET group.\nA Cochrane review published in 2015 found that patients who underwent early (&lt;=10 days) tracheotomy had a higher probability of discharge from the ICU at Day 28 than those who underwent later tracheotomy. A recent meta-analysis found that ET was associated with shorter mechanical ventilation and hospital stays, without differences in mortality. Our findings agree with these synthesized results. Reducing IMV and ICU stays is extremely important given the current shortage of ICU beds.\nIn daily practice, the decision about when to perform a tracheotomy is based on clinical and ventilatory criteria, previous institutional experience, and staff availability to do the procedure. To overcome the lack of a prospective randomized trial, we emulated a trial framework randomizing at Day 7, which is approximately when the necessity of doing a tracheotomy arises. We included demographic and objective parameters of severity respiratory failure in the analysis. We also included parameters known to influence the intensivist decision, such as pronation requirements, PAFI, PEEP levels, age, comorbidities, complications, difficulties in secretions management, and poor prognosis. In our study, treatment, sedation agents, and weaning criteria were not standardized among centers. Although it may be seen as a drawback, it represents real practice in the present pandemic scenario, and may give external validity to the cohort.\nMcGrath et al. published a consensus document suggesting that tracheotomy be delayed until at least Day 10 of mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 patients and only be considered if patients showed signs of clinical improvement. They also advised against tracheotomy when patients needed high fractions of inspired oxygen (FiO2), the prone position, or high ventilator requirements. Our participants in the ET and LT groups had similar characteristics at admission. Although the early group had higher PEEP at tracheotomy day (10.6 vs. 9.5, p &lt; 0.001), this difference has limited clinical value.\nThe prone position is often used to improve the ventilation/perfusion quotient in patients with COVID-19. The presence of a tracheotomy can make pronation maneuvers more difficult, and cannula displacement may also be favored. Some guidelines suggest tracheotomy be delayed if prone maneuvers are still required or even discourage tracheotomy altogether. However, pronation is not a formal contraindication for ET. As expected, our LT group had greater pronation requirements than our early group. Nonetheless, 63.4% of the ET patients were proned at some point, mostly (60.6%) before tracheotomy. Almost 25% continued pronation after tracheotomy without major incidences. Our results therefore suggest that pronation should not rule out ET and that patients should be considered on a case-by-case basis.\nWe found that the shorter IMV duration seen in the ET group was independent of ventilatory parameters at admission or tracheotomy. Previous reports based on smaller series have described similar, albeit not statistically significant, findings. \nOne of the criticisms of doing an ET is that we may perform more procedures than is strictly necessary. To test this hypothesis, we compared our ET participants who were weaned within 2 weeks of intubation (early) with those who were weaned after 2 weeks. Participants who weaned earlier were younger and had higher PAFI at tracheotomy, suggesting that the tracheotomy decision could be delayed in younger patients with clear signs of improvement. One can argue that perhaps some of these patients could have been extubated skipping a tracheotomy, or at least a trial of extubation being performed first. However, in the early days of the pandemic, lack of knowledge about the behavior of the disease, the risk of infection of staff, and the possibility of reintubation led to a conservative approach to risky maneuvers.\nAnother criticism of ET is the higher risk of complications in critically ill patients. The high mortality rate initially reported for COVID-19 patients favored avoiding invasive maneuvers, including surgery. Many of these patients also required intensive pronation, and some received anticoagulant drugs due to concomitant thrombosis, which may increase tracheotomy complications. Relevant postoperative complications after tracheotomy in non-COVID-19 patients range between 5.6% and 27.2%. In contrast, Long and colleagues found that up to 55.3% of tracheotomized COVID-19 patients were seen postoperative complications within the first 30 days, with no differences between percutaneous and open procedures. The main complications were local infection (36%), hemorrhage (19%), and subcutaneous emphysema (8.5%). Other studies have shown that minor bleeding from the stoma, usually managed with local measures, is the most common complication in tracheotomized COVID-19 patients and that few patients need revision surgery. We found a complication rate of 4.2% for ET and 11.2% for LT across our 696 participants from different institutions, tracheotomy types, and timelines. This difference was not statistically significant.\nOur study has limitations as well as strengths. The study design and inclusion criteria prevented us from analyzing the causal effects of tracheotomy timing on total days of IMV. Although the observed differences in total IMV duration post-tracheotomy described here are attributable to the tracheotomy timing, the observed differences in total duration of IMV were artificially inflated by immortal time bias and should not be interpreted as causal estimates. A randomized controlled trial with an intention-to-treat analysis would be preferable to establish the effect of ET on the total duration of IMV for patients admitted to ICU with COVID-19, although it is unlikely that it can be performed in the pandemic scenario.\nAs we used observational data, one can argue that residual confounding could be at least partially responsible for the observed findings. The most important bias could have been confounding by indication, where doctors may have decided to postpone tracheotomy in patients that were critically ill on the decision day. However, although the groups were not totally comparable, we did not find any evidence of confounding by indication, with baseline characteristics well balanced between the ET and LT groups. Moreover, multivariable adjustment, including APACHE II, SOFA, PAFI, PEEP, anticoagulant use, and pronation, did not attenuate the observed effects, with a good statistical power.\nAmong the strengths of the present study are the large number of participants and the prospective cohort design. We designed the analyses following a trial emulation framework with randomization at Day 7 of intubation for robustness. Using multiple centers, each with their own local protocols, no standardized weaning criteria or sedation agents, and variations in the type of tracheotomy, we ensured that this study has external validity. In addition, by collecting multiple objective clinical and ventilatory variables, we were able to gather wide, robust prognosis information. These aspects could have influenced the observed weaning and mortality rates. However, we expect any potential differences to be hospital-specific and therefore uninformative.\nIn conclusion, our prospective cohort study suggests that ET, when appropriate, may provide quicker weaning and ICU discharge for COVID-19 patients without added complications or increased mortality. These findings may help to release ICU beds, which is particularly necessary during the pandemic outbreak.\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST\nAll authors have completed the ICMJE uniform disclosure form at www.icmje.org/coi_disclosure.pdf and declare: Daniel Prieto-Alhambra reports grants and other from AMGEN; grants, nonfinancial support, and other from UCB Biopharma; grants from Les Laboratoires Servier, outside the submitted work; and Janssen, on behalf of IMI-funded EHDEN and EMIF consortiums, and Synapse Management Partners have supported training programs organized by Daniel Prieto-Alhambra's department and open for external participants.

We used these estimates to assess the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission to occur in locations outside Wuhan if cases were introduced.\n\n\nMethods\nWe combined a stochastic transmission model with data on cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan and international cases that originated in Wuhan to estimate how transmission had varied over time during January, 2020, and February, 2020. Based on these estimates, we then calculated the probability that newly introduced cases might generate outbreaks in other areas.\n\n To estimate the early dynamics of transmission in Wuhan, we fitted a stochastic transmission dynamic model to multiple publicly available datasets on cases in Wuhan and internationally exported cases from Wuhan.\n\n The four datasets we fitted to were: daily number of new internationally exported cases (or lack thereof), by date of onset, as of Jan 26, 2020; daily number of new cases in Wuhan with no market exposure, by date of onset, between Dec 1, 2019, and Jan 1, 2020; daily number of new cases in China, by date of onset, between Dec 29, 2019, and Jan 23, 2020; and proportion of infected passengers on evacuation flights between Jan 29, 2020, and Feb 4, 2020. We used an additional two datasets for comparison with model outputs: daily number of new exported cases from Wuhan (or lack thereof) in countries with high connectivity to Wuhan (ie, top 20 most at-risk countries), by date of confirmation, as of Feb 10, 2020; and data on new confirmed cases reported in Wuhan between Jan 16, 2020, and Feb 11, 2020.\nFindings\nWe estimated that the median daily reproduction number (Rt) in Wuhan declined from 2·35 (95% CI 1·15–4·77) 1 week before travel restrictions were introduced on Jan 23, 2020, to 1·05 (0·41–2·39) 1 week after.\n\n Based on our estimates of Rt, assuming SARS-like variation, we calculated that in locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan in early January, once there are at least four independently introduced cases, there is a more than 50% chance the infection will establish within that population.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur results show that COVID-19 transmission probably declined in Wuhan during late January, 2020, coinciding with the introduction of travel control measures.\n\n As more cases arrive in international locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan before these control measures, it is likely many chains of transmission will fail to establish initially, but might lead to new outbreaks eventually.\n\n\nFunding\nWellcome Trust, Health Data Research UK, Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, and National Institute for Health Research.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7158569","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Science ;, The Lancet Pub.

The median duration of shedding infectious virus is 8 days post onset of symptoms (IQR 5–11) and drops below 5% after 15.2 days post onset of symptoms (95% confidence interval (CI) 13.4–17.2).\n Multivariate analyses identify viral loads above 7 log10 RNA copies/mL (odds ratio [OR] of 14.7 (CI 3.57-58.1; p?&lt;?0.001) as independently associated with isolation of infectious SARS-CoV-2 from the respiratory tract.\n A serum neutralizing antibody titre of at least 1:20 (OR of 0.01 (CI 0.003-0.08; p?&lt;?0.001) is independently associated with non-infectious SARS-CoV-2.

with COVID-19, the median age was 55.0 years and 48.9% were male and only 8 (3.6%) patients had a history of exposure to the Huanan Seafood Market.\n\n Compared to the non-severe pneumonia patients, the median age of the severe patients was significantly older, and they were more likely to have chronic comorbidities.\n\n Most common symptoms in severe patients were high fever, anorexia and dyspnea.\n\n On admission, 33.0% patients showed leukopenia and 73.8% showed lymphopenia.\n\n In addition, the severe patients suffered a higher rate of co-infections with bacteria or fungus and they were more likely to developing complications.\n\n As of February 15, 2020, 19.0% patients had been discharged and 5.4% patients died.\n\n 80% of severe cases received ICU (intensive care unit) care,

Coronavirus–Infected Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nThe initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7121484","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical

novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR

pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%)

outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), consistent and considerable differences in disease severity and mortality rate of patients treated in Hubei province compared to those in other parts of China have been observed.\n\n We sought to compare the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients being treated inside and outside Hubei province, and explore the factors underlying these differences.\n\n\nMethods\nCollaborating with the National Health Commission, we established a retrospective cohort to study hospitalised COVID-19 cases in China.\n\n Clinical characteristics, the rate of severe events and deaths, and the time to critical illness (invasive ventilation or intensive care unit admission or death) were compared between patients within and outside Hubei.\n\n The impact of Wuhan-related exposure (a presumed key factor that drove the severe situation in Hubei, as Wuhan is the epicentre as well the administrative centre of Hubei province) and the duration between symptom onset and admission on prognosis were also determined.\n\n\nResults\nAt the data cut-off (31 January 2020), 1590 cases from 575 hospitals in 31 provincial administrative regions were collected (core cohort).\n\n The overall rate of severe cases and mortality was 16.0% and 3.2%, respectively.\n\n Patients in Hubei (predominantly with Wuhan-related exposure, 597 (92.3%) out of 647) were older (mean age 49.7 versus 44.9?years), had more cases with comorbidity (32.9% versus 19.7%), higher symptomatic burden, abnormal radiologic manifestations and, especially, a longer waiting time between symptom onset and admission (5.7 versus 4.5?days) compared with patients outside Hubei.\n\n Patients in Hubei (severe event rate 23.0% versus 11.1%, death rate 7.3% versus 0.3%, HR (95% CI) for critical illness 1.59 (1.05–2.41)) have a poorer prognosis compared with patients outside Hubei after adjusting for age and comorbidity.\n\n However, among patients outside Hubei, the duration from symptom onset to hospitalisation (mean 4.4 versus 4.7?days) and prognosis (HR (95%) 0.84 (0.40–1.80)) were similar between patients with or without Wuhan-related exposure.\n\n In the overall population, the waiting time, but neither treated in Hubei nor Wuhan-related exposure, remained an independent prognostic factor (HR (95%) 1.05 (1.01–1.08)).\n\n\nConclusion\nThere were more severe cases and poorer outcomes for COVID-19 patients treated in Hubei, which might be attributed to the prolonged duration of symptom onset to hospitalisation in the epicentre.\n\n Future studies to determine the reason for delaying hospitalisation are warranted.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7144336","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"European Respiratory

?6.76 (P &lt;0.0001)); I2?=?97% (P &lt;0.00001)) and reduced odds for stoma inflammation (OR, 0.38 (95% CI, 0.19 to 0.76 (P?=?0.006)); I2?=?2% (P?=?0.36)), and infection (OR, 0.22 (95% CI, 0.11 to 0.41 (P &lt;0.00001)); I2?=?0% (P?=?0.54)), but increased odds for procedural technical difficulties (OR, 4.58 (95% CI, 2.21 to 9.47 (P &lt;0.0001)); I2?=?0% (P?=?0.63)).\n\n PT techniques reduced odds for postprocedural major bleeding (OR, 0.39 (95% CI, 0.15 to 0.97 (P?=?0.04)); I2?=?0% (P?=?0.69)), but not when a single RCT using translaryngeal tracheostomy was excluded (OR, 0.58 (95% CI, 0.21 to 1.63 (P?=?0.30)); I2?=?0% (P?=?0.89)).\n\n Eight RCTs compared different PT techniques in 700 patients.\n\n Multiple (MDT) and single step (SSDT) dilatator techniques are associated with the lowest odds for difficult dilatation or cannula insertion (OR, 0.30 (95% CI, 0.12 to 0.80 (P?=?0.02)); I2?=?56% (P?=?0.03)) and major intraprocedural bleeding (OR, 0.29 (95% CI, 0.10 to 0.85 (P?=?0.02)); I2?=?0% (P?=?0.72)), compared to the guide wire dilatation forceps technique.\n\n\nConclusion\nIn critically ill adult patients, PT techniques can be performed faster and reduce stoma inflammation and infection but are associated with increased technical difficulties when compared to ST.\n\n Among PT techniques, MDT and SSDT were associated with the lowest intraprocedural risks and seem to be preferable.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13054-014-0544-7) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized

otolaryngology procedures and the need for enhanced PPE during the COVID-19 pandemic: a literature review","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>Adequate personal protective equipment is needed to reduce the rate of transmission of COVID-19 to health care workers.\n\n Otolaryngology groups are recommending a higher level of personal protective equipment for aerosol-generating procedures than public health agencies.\n\n The objective of the review was to provide evidence that a.\n\n) demonstrates which otolaryngology procedures are aerosol-generating, and that b.\n\n) clarifies whether the higher level of PPE advocated by otolaryngology groups is justified.\n\n\nMain body\nid='Par2'>Health care workers in China who performed tracheotomy during the SARS-CoV-1 epidemic had 4.15 times greater odds of contracting the virus than controls who did not perform tracheotomy (95% CI 2.75–7.54).\n\n No other studies provide direct epidemiological evidence of increased aerosolized transmission of viruses during otolaryngology procedures.\n\n Experimental evidence has shown that electrocautery, advanced energy devices, open suctioning, and drilling can create aerosolized biological particles.\n\n The viral load of COVID-19 is highest in the upper aerodigestive tract, increasing the likelihood that aerosols generated during procedures of the upper aerodigestive tract of infected patients would carry viral material.\n\n Cough and normal breathing create aerosols which may increase the risk of transmission during outpatient procedures.\n\n A significant proportion of individuals infected with COVID-19 may not have symptoms, raising the likelihood of transmission of the disease to inadequately protected health care workers from patients who do not have probable or confirmed infection.\n\n Powered air purifying respirators, if used properly, provide a greater level of filtration than N95 masks and thus may reduce the risk of transmission.\n\n\nConclusion\nid='Par3'>Direct and indirect evidence suggests that a large number of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery procedures are aerosol generating.\n\n Otolaryngologists are likely at high risk of contracting COVID-19 during aerosol generating procedures because they are likely exposed to high viral loads in patients infected with the virus.\n\n Based on the precautionary principle, even though the evidence is not definitive, adopting enhanced personal protective equipment protocols is reasonable based on the evidence.\n\n Further research is needed to clarify the risk associated with performing various procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the degree to which various personal protective equipment reduces the

an unprecedented surge in the number of critically ill patients who require mechanical ventilation due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n The requirement for relatively long periods of ventilation in those who survive means that many are considered for tracheostomy to free patients from ventilatory support and maximise scarce resources.\n COVID-19 provides unique challenges for tracheostomy care: health-care workers need to safely undertake tracheostomy procedures and manage patients afterwards, minimising risks of nosocomial transmission and compromises in the quality of care.\n Conflicting recommendations exist about case selection, the timing and performance of tracheostomy, and the subsequent management of patients.\n In response, we convened an international working group of individuals with relevant expertise in tracheostomy.\n We did a literature and internet search for reports of research pertaining to tracheostomy during the COVID-19 pandemic, supplemented by sources comprising statements and guidance on tracheostomy care.\n By synthesising early experiences from countries that have managed a surge in patient numbers, emerging virological data, and international, multidisciplinary expert opinion, we aim to provide consensus guidelines and recommendations on the conduct and management of tracheostomy during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n","id":"PMC7228735","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Brendan

The dynamics of antibodies with the disease progress was analyzed.\n\n\nResults\nAmong 173 patients, the seroconversion rate for Ab, IgM and IgG was 93.1%, 82.7% and 64.7%, respectively.\n\n The reason for the negative antibody findings in 12 patients might due to the lack of blood samples at the later stage of illness.\n\n The median seroconversion time for Ab, IgM and then IgG were day-11, day-12 and day-14, separately.\n\n The presence of antibodies was &lt;40% among patients within 1-week since onset, and rapidly increased to 100.0% (Ab), 94.3% (IgM) and 79.8% (IgG) since day-15 after onset.\n\n In contrast, RNA detectability decreased from 66.7% (58/87) in samples collected before day-7 to 45.5% (25/55) during day 15-39.

2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing

commonly used method for handling incomplete covariates as it can provide valid inference when data are missing at random.\n\n This depends on being able to correctly specify the parametric model used to impute missing values, which may be difficult in many realistic settings.\n\n Imputation by predictive mean matching (PMM) borrows an observed value from a donor with a similar predictive mean; imputation by local residual draws (LRD) instead borrows the donor’s residual.\n\n Both methods relax some assumptions of parametric imputation, promising greater robustness when the imputation model is misspecified.\n\n\nMethods\nWe review development of PMM and LRD and outline the various forms available, and aim to clarify some choices about how and when they should be used.\n\n We compare performance to fully parametric imputation in simulation studies, first when the imputation model is correctly specified and then when it is misspecified.\n\n\nResults\nIn using PMM or LRD we strongly caution against using a single donor, the default value in some implementations, and instead advocate sampling from a pool of around 10 donors.\n\n We also clarify which matching metric is best.\n\n Among the current MI software there are several poor implementations.\n\n\nConclusions\nPMM and LRD may have a role for imputing covariates (i) which are not strongly associated with outcome, and (ii) when the imputation model is thought to be slightly but not grossly misspecified.\n\n Researchers should spend efforts on specifying the imputation model correctly, rather than expecting predictive mean matching or local residual draws to do the work.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4051964","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Tim

interactions: an evaluation of statistical methods","abstract":"Background\nMultiple imputation is often used for missing data.\n\n When a model contains as covariates more than one function of a variable, it is not obvious how best to impute missing values in these covariates.\n\n Consider a regression with outcome Y and covariates X and X2.\n\n In 'passive imputation' a value X* is imputed for X and then X2 is imputed as (X*)2.\n\n A recent proposal is to treat X2 as 'just another variable' (JAV) and impute X and X2 under multivariate normality.\n\n\nMethods\nWe use simulation to investigate the performance of three methods that can easily be implemented in standard software: 1) linear regression of X on Y to impute X then passive imputation of X2; 2) the same regression but with predictive mean matching (PMM); and 3) JAV.\n\n We also investigate the performance of analogous methods when the analysis involves an interaction, and study the theoretical properties of JAV.\n\n The application of the methods when complete or incomplete confounders are also present is illustrated using data from the EPIC Study.\n\n\nResults\nJAV gives consistent estimation when the analysis is linear regression with a quadratic or interaction term and X is missing completely at random.\n\n When X is missing at random, JAV may be biased, but this bias is generally less than for passive imputation and PMM.\n\n Coverage for JAV was usually good when bias was small.\n\n However, in some scenarios with a more pronounced quadratic effect, bias was large and coverage poor.\n\n When the analysis was logistic regression, JAV's performance was sometimes very poor.\n\n PMM generally improved on passive imputation, in terms of bias and coverage, but did not eliminate the bias.\n\n\nConclusions\nGiven the current state of available software, JAV is the best of a set of imperfect imputation methods for linear regression with a quadratic or interaction effect, but should not be used for logistic regression.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3403931","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Shaun

for an incomplete covariate that is a ratio","abstract":"We are concerned with multiple imputation of the ratio of two variables, which is to be used as a covariate in a regression analysis.\n If the numerator and denominator are not missing simultaneously, it seems sensible to make use of the observed variable in the imputation model.\n One such strategy is to impute missing values for the numerator and denominator, or the log-transformed numerator and denominator, and then calculate the ratio of interest; we call this ‘passive’ imputation.\n Alternatively, missing ratio values might be imputed directly, with or without the numerator and/or the denominator in the imputation model; we call this ‘active’ imputation.\n In two motivating datasets, one involving body mass index as a covariate and the other involving the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, we assess the sensitivity of results to the choice of imputation model and, as an alternative, explore fully Bayesian joint models for the outcome and incomplete ratio.\n Fully Bayesian approaches using Winbugs were unusable in both datasets because of computational problems.\n In our first dataset, multiple imputation results are similar regardless of the imputation model; in the second, results are sensitive to the choice of imputation model.\n Sensitivity depends strongly on the coefficient of variation of the ratio's denominator.\n A simulation study demonstrates that passive imputation without transformation is risky because it can lead to downward bias when the coefficient of variation of the ratio's denominator is larger than about 0.1. Active imputation or passive imputation after log-transformation is preferable.\n © 2013 The Authors.\n Statistics in Medicine published by John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.\n","id":"PMC3920636","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd","authors":[{"firstname":"Tim P","surname":"Morris","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ian R","surname":"White","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Patrick","surname":"Royston","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shaun R","surname":"Seaman","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Angela M","surname":"Wood","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/S0895-4356(02)00539-5","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Developing a prognostic model in the presence of missing data","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Regression models and life tables","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1002/sim.3618","date":"2009-04-02","title":"Imputing missing covariate values for the Cox model","abstract":"Multiple imputation is commonly used to impute missing data, and is typically more efficient than complete cases analysis in regression analysis when covariates have missing values.\n Imputation may be performed using a regression model for the incomplete covariates on other covariates and, importantly, on the outcome.\n With a survival outcome, it is a common practice to use the event indicator D and the log of the observed event or censoring time T in the imputation model, but the rationale is not clear.\n","id":"PMC2998703","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Ian R","surname":"White","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Patrick","surname":"Royston","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.jeconom.2011.02.005","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Regression with imputed covariates: A generalized missing-indicator approach","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1177/0049124113502943","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Multiple imputation of squared terms","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement: guidelines for reporting observational studies","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Safety of bedside surgical tracheostomy during COVID-19 pandemic: a retrospective observational study","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2002032","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China","abstract":"Background\nSince December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020.

coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing Municipal Science and Technology

of intensive care units (ICUs) in Australia to respond to the expected increase in demand associated with COVID?19.\nDesign\nAnalysis of Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society (ANZICS) registry data, supplemented by an ICU surge capability survey and veterinary facilities survey (both March 2020).\n\n\nSettings\nAll Australian ICUs and veterinary facilities.\n\n\nMain outcome measures\nBaseline numbers of ICU beds, ventilators, dialysis machines, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation machines, intravenous infusion pumps, and staff (senior medical staff, registered nurses); incremental capability to increase capacity (surge) by increasing ICU bed numbers; ventilator?to?bed ratios; number of ventilators in veterinary facilities.\n\n\nResults\nThe 191 ICUs in Australia provide 2378 intensive care beds during baseline activity (9.3 ICU beds per 100 000 population).\n\n Of the 175 ICUs that responded to the surge survey (with 2228 intensive care beds), a maximal surge would add an additional 4258 intensive care beds (191% increase) and 2631 invasive ventilators (120% increase).\n\n This surge would require additional staffing of as many as 4092 senior doctors (245% increase over baseline) and 42 720 registered ICU nurses (269% increase over baseline).\n\n An additional 188 ventilators are available in veterinary facilities, including 179 human model ventilators.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe directors of Australian ICUs report that intensive care bed capacity could be near tripled in response to the expected increase in demand caused by COVID?19. But maximal surge in bed numbers could be hampered by a shortfall in invasive ventilators and would also require a large increase in clinician and nursing staff numbers.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7264562","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley and Sons Inc.","authors":[{"firstname":"Edward","surname":"Litton","email":"ed.litton@health.wa.gov.au","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tamara","surname":"Bucci","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shaila","surname":"Chavan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yvonne Y","surname":"Ho","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Anthony","surname":"Holley","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gretta","surname":"Howard","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sue","surname":"Huckson","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Philomena","surname":"Kwong","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Johnny","surname":"Millar","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nhi","surname":"Nguyen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Paul","surname":"Secombe","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Marc","surname":"Ziegenfuss","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"David","surname":"Pilcher","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1503/cmaj.200457","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Projecting demand for critical care beds during COVID-19 outbreaks in Canada","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Anandaciva S (2020) Critical care services in the English NHS.

Early experience from Venice, Italy\nPurpose\nThe need for prolonged invasive mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 patients is placing the otorhinolaryngologist in front of an increasing request for tracheostomy. Nowadays, there is uncertainty regarding the timing of tracheostomy, the prognosis of these patients and the safety of healthcare workers. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tracheostomy placement in patients with COVID-19.\nMethods\nA retrospective cohort study on 23 COVID 19 patients, to analyse the timing of tracheostomy, the risk factors associated with in-hospital death and the infection of the involved health care workers. Early tracheostomy was defined as &lt;= 10 days and late ones &gt; 10 days.\nResults\nThe mortality rate of COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU that underwent tracheostomy was 18%. The overall mortality of patients admitted to ICU was 53%. The univariate analysis revealed that early tracheostomy, SOFA score &gt; 6, and D-dimer level &gt; 4 were significantly associated with a greater risk of death. At the multivariate analysis SOFA score &gt; 6 and D-dimer level &gt; 4 resulted as significant factors for a higher risk of death. No health care workers associated with tracheostomy are confirmed to be infected by SARS-CoV2.\nConclusion\nWe suggest to wait at least 14 days to perform tracheostomy. In patients with SOFA score &gt; 6 and D dimer &gt; 4, tracheostomy should not be performed or should be postponed. Optimized procedures and enhanced personal protective equipment can make the tracheostomy safe and beneficial in COVID-19 patients.\nIntroduction\nUp to May 18, 2020, a total of 224,760 had tested positive for COVID-19 in Italy and 31763 of them died. The metropolitan city of Venice, with an average population of 259414 inhabitants had 2617 confirmed cases with 256 deaths. In Venice, the incidence of SARS-COVID-2 was 1/110 inhabitants with a mortality rate of 9.8%. As a Hub Hospital, our institution was one of the first in Veneto and in Italy to treat confirmed COVID-19, as this local area was recognized as one of the most critical areas of Northeastern Italy.\nThe critical cases have been defined by the occurrence of respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation and treatment in the ICU. Recent data from Europe suggest that in the most critically ill patients, the duration of invasive ventilation could go up to 21 days.\nThe prognosis of this novel disease is not yet fully understood and mortality rates for those requiring critical care varies a lot among different countries: 26% in Lombardy, 49% in Wuhan, 39% USA and 51,6% UK.\nThe guidelines of performing a tracheostomy asserted that it is a standard of care due to its potentiality of reducing the duration of mechanical ventilation and length of stay on intensive care, but its utility in the recovery of patients with COVID-19 is unknown.\nFrom the data found in the literature, the need for tracheostomies for ICU patients ranges normally from 2 to 11%.\nAt the beginning of March 2020, the Italian Society of Otorhinolaryngology, the British Association of Otorhinolaryngology, and the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery warned the otolaryngologists on a possible increase in the request for tracheostomies related to the COVID-19 infection.\nDuring the COVID emergency, 23 of the 50 patients (46%), hospitalized in intensive care for COVID-19 in our hospital, underwent a temporary tracheostomy. Looking at the request for tracheostomy in the same period in 2019 and 2018, there was an increase in the execution of tracheostomies, respectively, of 69.5% and 56.5%.\nAs an aerosol-generating procedure, tracheostomy increases healthcare worker exposure to COVID-19 infection, but the duration of viral load and correlation with transmission rate are not yet precisely known.\nFor which patients is tracheostomy indicated?\nWhat is the best timing for tracheostomy?\nWhich is the correlation between viral load and staff security?\nGiven these challenging issues, we have retrospectively analyzed our data to try to give an answer to three main problems related to tracheostomy in the COVID-19 patients:\nWe hypothesized that patients with poorer prognosis have a higher SOFA score and higher D-dimer level.\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the timing, appropriateness and staff security of tracheostomy in patients receiving PMV in our medical-surgical ICU for SARS-COVID19.\nMethods\nThis is a retrospective cohort study, which was conducted at Angel Hospital and Saints Giovanni e Paolo Hospital (Venice, Italy) from 22nd February 2020 to 26th April 2020.\nThe inclusion criteria for participants were (a) positive to COVID-19; (b) tracheostomy.\nAge.\nGender.\nComorbidities (diabetes, hypertension...).\nDate of intubation.\nDate of tracheostomy.\nType of tracheostomy (surgical vs percutaneous).\nMortality.\nSedation.\nDate to sub-intensive unit.\nDate of weaning from VAM.\nDate of decannulation.\nSequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score\nSOFA (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment)-score at the day of intubation and of the day before tracheostomy calculated using https://www.mdcalc.com/ (see Fig. 1).\nD-dimer level.\nThe following variables were selected:\nTo explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death, univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. Variables were chosen on the basis of previous findings and clinical constraints.\nPrevious studies have shown blood levels of D-dimer and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores to be higher in critically ill or fatal cases.\nSimilar risk factors, including older age, have been reported to be associated with adverse clinical outcomes in adults with SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Other studies underlined the negative effect of hypertension, cardiovascular disease and diabetes on survival.\nTherefore, hypertension and cardiovascular disease, diabetes, pulmonary disease, simultaneous presence of two and/or three diseases, D-dimer, SOFA score at intubation and at tracheostomy and age were selected for our logistic regression model.\nA statistical investigation was conducted to determine whether the timing of tracheostomy procedure was a prognostic factor for the survival status of the patients. Hence, tracheostomy was defined as early if performed within 10 days after intubation, as late otherwise. The average intubation time in this study was 13.7 days; thus, a 10-day threshold allowed to investigate the effect of an earlier-than-average tracheostomy. Moreover, previous studies have considered as early those procedures performed between 7 and 14 days from intubation. At the moment, there are no single criteria on the timing to perform the tracheostomy. In this study, patients were evaluated daily; the procedure was performed when the anesthesiologists verified that they could not be weaned from mechanical ventilation and the clinical conditions were stable, albeit the severity. Given the greater propensity in our hospital to perform surgical tracheostomies by otolaryngologists, this was the most used technique.\nOpen surgical tracheostomy procedures\nWe performed the first tracheostomy on 10th March 2020 when no ENT guidelines on safe tracheostomy were already been published.\nThe inclusion criteria in patients undergoing open surgical tracheostomy were patients have tested positive for COVID-19 with nasal pharyngeal swab for rtPCR assay testing and need for prolonged mechanical ventilation (for 5 or more days). The exclusion criteria, on the other hand, included patients with grave hypoxemia, severe incorrect coagulopathy or with multi-organ failure.\nFor each patient, we carried out a multidisciplinary discussion between the primary team, the team of procedures and the family to establish the objectives of the assistance, the general prognosis and the expected benefits of the tracheotomy.\nFor protective apparel, we adopted as a reference handbook of COVID-19, where level III protection consisting of mask FFP3 (Europe) or N95, surgical cap, goggles and face shield (can be worn on top of goggles), surgical gown (use of double gown is preferable, where available) and gloves (use of double nitrile gloves) was suggested. Cap and shoe covers were considered necessary for safely dressing.\nEven Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) doffing was a crucial moment which was carried out in a dedicated room. It is important to note that the wear and removal of PPE were sequential processes requiring proper training.\nProcedure of open surgical tracheotomy. ETT endotracheal tube, HME heat and moisture exchangers\nFor the surgical tracheostomy placements, we followed the procedure contained in the &quot;Safe tracheostomy for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome&quot; summarized in Fig. 2.\nWe performed all tracheostomies in the ICU in negative-pressure rooms to avoid unnecessary transport of patients and repeated connection and disconnection of ventilatory circuits during transfer. Staff includes two surgeons, one intensive care specialist, one nurse of intensive care and two scrub nurses. One of the scrub nurses did not enter the room and supported the personnel in the wearing and removal of PPE and in preparing surgical instruments. Due to the respiratory issues, cannula with a large inner diameter was selected (Shiley 8 or 10). Cannula change was planned 7-10 days later using the same precautions (PPE utilization and airflow interruption). Afterwards, cannula change can be delayed 30 days after.\nStatistical methods\nAt univariate level, the Fisher test was conducted to analyze the association between the response variable and all the categorical variables. Then a multivariate logistic regression was performed to investigate the effect of the variables on survival. A significance level of 10% was selected. Statistical analyses were performed using Software &quot;R&quot;.\nResults\nCOVID 19 patients medical value and follow up\nCase N	Gender	Age	No days intubated (E2T)	SOFA SCORE Intubation	SOFA SCORE tracheostomy	Weaned of sedation	Days of VAM	D	No Days to decanollation	D-Dimero	Alive	No Days from tracheostomy to deaths	Days in ICU	Outcome (Ward, ICU, discharge)	 	1	M	81	10	7	4	Yes	-	No	-	1.59	No	12	13	-	 	2	M	84	17	4	5	Yes	48	No	-	2.11	Yes	-	-	ICU	 	3	M	75	16	4	-	Yes	46	No	-	0.53	Yes	-	35	Ward	 	4	F	77	9	7	6	No	-	No	-	1.44	No	7	15	-	 	5	M	81	10	10	5	Yes	-	No	-	&gt; 10	No	18	27	-	 	6	M	77	9	7	3	Yes	32	Yes	36	0.73	Yes	-	18	Discharge	 	7	M	72	15	6	8	Yes	40	No	-	0.87	Yes	-	32	1CU	 	8	M	67	23	8	9	Yes	40	No	-	3.42	Yes	-	30	Ward	 	9	M	60	18	4	10	Yes	18	No	-	2.20	Yes	-	16	ICU	 	10	M	60	10	4	11	No	-	No	-	&gt; 10	No	15	24	-	 	11	M	61	15	3	4	Yes	38	No	-	1.61	Yes	-	27	Ward	 	12	M	48	26	8	8	No	46	No	-	6.67	No	18	44	-	 	13	M	49	13	4	3	Yes	31	No	-	4.83	Yes	-	22	Ward	 	14	M	76	15	4	7	Yes	28	Yes	21	3.66	Yes	-	20	Discharge	 	15	14	77	13	7	9	No	-	No	-	4.21	No	4	46	-	 	16	M	71	5	6	5	Yes	25	Yes	29	6.28	Yes	-	11	Ward	 	17	M	73	10	7	12	Yes	22	No	-	0.96	Yes	-	38	ICU	 	18	M	42	22	5	4	Yes	26	Yes	30	0.49	Yes	-	24	Discharge	 	19	M	68	14	3	8	No	25	Yes	17	0.46	Yes	-	38	Discharge	 	20	F	79	11	4	5	Yes	21	Yes	22	3.14	Yes	-	27	Ward	 	21	M	51	8	6	5	No	-	No	-	&gt; 10	No	14	-	-	 	22	M	79	7	10	3	No	-	No	-	&gt; 10	No	10	14	-	 	23	M	82	21	5	9	No	-	No	-	0.89	No	26	47	-	 	\nD decannulation, VAM ventilation assisted mechanical\nPatients characteristics and comorbility\nPatients characteristics	ICU care (n = 23)	 	Age, years	69 (42-84)	 	Sex	 	 Men	21 (91%)	 	 Women	2 (8%)	 	Current smoking	4 (17%)	 	Diabetes	7 (30%)	 	Hypertension	11 (47%)	 	Cardiovascular disease	4 (17%)	 	Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease	88 (34%)	 	Malignancy	0	 	Obesity	3 (13%)	 	Chronic liver disease	0	 	\nTotally, 50 patients were admitted in the ICU and ventilated with IVM with a diagnosis of COVID-19. The study cohort comprises 23 patients (21 men and 2 women with a median age of 69 years) who underwent a tracheostomy. Population characteristics are summarized in Tables 1 and 2.\nTwenty-two surgical tracheostomies and one percutaneous tracheostomy were performed.\nThe average time between the intubation date and the tracheostomy date was 13 days. The mean time that the patients were mechanically ventilated was 29 days. Mean time in ICU was 27 days. Patients with a longer hospital stay in intensive care were suffering from pre-existing pathologies and in this case, tracheostomy was necessary in the prevision of a more difficult weaning by mechanical ventilation.\nNine tracheostomies were performed early, while 14 tracheostomies were performed late. After a median follow-up of 50 days (IQR, 30.0-71.0 days), 9 patients (39%) died, 5 (22%) were receiving invasive mechanical ventilation in the ICU, 3 (13%) were discharged from the ICU and are in the pneumological sub-intensive unit, and 6 (26%) were decannulated and discharged. One patient has had complications; he presented post-tracheostomy bleeding, and he was on therapeutic anticoagulation.\nIn addition, a preliminary analysis of mortality rate of the entire sample of patients with COVID-19 recovered at ICU was carried out. The overall mortality rate was 53%; the mortality rate of patients with no tracheostomy was 35%; the mortality rate of patients with tracheostomy was 18%, of these, 6 (66.7%) tracheostomies were performed early and 3 (33.3%) late.\nAmong alive patients, mean time between tracheostomy and decannulation was 26.8 days (with a minimum of 17 and maximum of 36). Among dead patients mean time between intubation and death was 21 days and mean time between tracheostomy and death was 13.7 days. In our study, an early tracheostomy was associated with a greater risk of death. To date, none of our tracheostomy team has developed any symptoms of fever, general malaise, cough, shortness of breath and/or have tested positive for COVID-19 with nasal pharyngeal swab for rtPCR assay testing.\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical univariate and multivariate analysis results\n	Total (n = 23)	Survivor (n = 14) 60%	Non survivor (n = 9) 40%	p value univariate analysis	p value multivariate analysis	 	Early tracheostomy	9 (39%)	3 (21%)	6 (66%)	0.077	-	 	SOFA score intubation &gt; 6	9 (39%)	3 (21%)	6 (66%)	0.077	0.059	 	D-dimero &gt; 4	8 (35%)	2 (14%)	6 (66%)	0.023	0.028	 	\nThe univariate analysis revealed that early tracheostomy, SOFA score at intubation higher than 6 and D-dimer level higher than 4 were significantly associated with a greater risk of death with a p value, respectively, of 0.077, 0.077 and 0.023. At the multivariate analysis, SOFA score at intubation higher than 6 and D-dimer level higher than 4 were significantly associated with a greater risk of death with a p value, respectively, of 0.059 and 0.028. The variables age, sex, presence and number of comorbidities, and SOFA score at tracheostomy did not correlate with mortality rate. Results of statistical analysis are summarized in Table 3.\nDiscussion\nTracheostomy in patients with COVID-19-associated respiratory failure is a challenging procedure due to both its severity, duration and risk of infections.\nFrom data emerging in the literature and based on clinical experience, patients with COVID-19-associated respiratory failure required ventilatory support more than 4 weeks, which causes side effects such as prolonged rehabilitation as well as severe critical illness and neuropathy.\nTracheostomy is a widely used intervention in patients with acute respiratory failure needing prolonged IMV, but so far, no recommendation on COVID-19-affected patients exists.\nAt the moment, there are at least three unsolved questions regarding the execution of tracheostomies in COVID-19 patients.\nThe first concerns the prognosis of patients admitted to intensive care for COVID-19. Severe and critical illness occurred in approximately 20% of the patients after admission to hospital. To decide whether to tracheostomize patients, it would be important to define prognostic survival indicators.\nIn contrast with Grasselli et al., in our preliminary study, elder age and coexisting medical condition were not associated with a greater risk of poor outcome. On the other side, in accordance with Zhou, our preliminary experience identified as risk factors for COVID-19 mortality the high SOFA score and increased D-dimer. Further studies are needed to better understand this association, but clinicians should be aware that for patients with SOFA score higher than 6 and D-dimer level higher than 4, tracheostomy could be not indicated or at least should be postponed.\nThe second problem concerns the timing of the execution of this operation: &quot;Can an early tracheostomy improve the survival of patients since it reduces the ventilatory dead space, decreases the probability of ventilator pneumonia, decreases the stay in ICU, decreases the probability of developing septic shock and disseminated intravascular coagulation (CID)?&quot; In such a serious escalating pandemic, the aim of treating patients with COVID 19 disease is to maximize the likelihood of recovery as quickly as possible for the greatest number of patients.\nIn some hospitals, due to the short supply of resources such as ventilators and sedatives, an early tracheostomy, within 7 days of intubation, was initially proposed to be performed to reduce the patient's need for sedation and to allow for an earlier transfer to the sub-intensive area. Others argued that reducing sedation and partially returning the patient to spontaneous breathing could cause negative effects on oxygenation and respiratory pattern. Furthermore, Chao et al. suggest to wait beyond 21 days for the viral load to decrease and to avoid unnecessary tracheostomies in particularly, critically ill patients.\nThe American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck surgery suggests that tracheostomy should be performed after 14 days of endotracheal intubation, but there is no evidence as to the optimal timing of tracheostomy.\nAlthough outcome data on prone positioning in COVID-19 (used in 12% of patients in one ICU study from Wuhan) are currently lacking, the tendency for SARS-CoV-2 to affect the peripheral and dorsal areas of the lungs provides the ideal conditions for a positive oxygenation response to prone positioning. Considering that some patients have to be prone in some cases for even 10 days and that tracheostomy within the first 24 h is a relative contraindication to pronation, it would be better to wait at least 10 days to perform tracheostomy.\nThe timing of tracheostomy is yet to be defined in such critically ill patients, but our results and recommendations worldwide would suggest performing a tracheostomy after at least 14 days of endotracheal intubation in patients who are unable to be weaned by ventilator but who have sufficient chances of survival.\nConsidering that in our study, mean time from intubation to death was 21 days, for patients with higher SOFA score and higher D-dimer level, we suggest to wait until 21 days to decide for tracheostomy to avoid clinically vain procedures for patients and to rule out health care workers from worthless exposure risks.\nThe third problem concerns the viral load of COVID-19 and the infectious capacity of the virus.\nIn Italy on April 5th, 12,252 health workers have tested positive for COVID-19, resulting in 10% of Italy's COVID-19 cases; at the time we were writing, 165 medical doctors and 40 nurses have died. In China, more than 3300 healthcare workers were infected (4% of the 81,285 reported infections). In Spain, on 25th March, nearly 6500 medical personnel were infected, 13.6% of the country's 47,600 total cases and 1% of the health system's workforce.\nAs an aerosol-generating procedure, tracheostomy increases healthcare worker exposure to COVID-19 infection, but the duration of viral load and correlation with transmission rate is not yet precisely known.\nLiterature data show how the virus can remain in the body for up to 2 months. However, in some cases, it may not be clinically or practically feasible to wait for a negative result prior to undertaking tracheostomy.\nOur preliminary experience and early experience from other Italian and Chinese studies support the safety of tracheostomy if appropriate protocols are strictly followed. After 1 month from the last tracheostomy we performed, none of our team developed symptoms of COVID-19. Specifically, recommendations contained in &quot;Safe tracheostomy for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome&quot; revealed to be safe in our experience. The dress and undressing procedures and the use of specific DPI were of fundamental importance and limit the infections among clinicians; moreover, having a dedicated experienced team to fulfill tracheostomies will allow familiarity with the procedure, curtail the risk of contamination and decrease setup time.\nThis study has several limitations. First, our study might have selection bias because it was a single-center, retrospective study, with limited sample size, even if it had sufficient power to detect the significant differences between groups in mortality. Second, there is no assessment of the follow-up effect of the SARS-CoV-2 on discharged patients, although patients in this study were thought to have definite outcomes. Third, for the greater propensity in our hospital to perform surgical tracheostomies, it was not possible to carry out an analysis and comparison with percutaneous tracheostomies.\nFinally, due to the short follow-up, we do not have data of beneficial effect of tracheostomy on long-term mortality and on the potential complications associated with tracheostomy; thus, further studies focusing on long-term outcomes are warranted.\nThe strength of our study is that is the first case series to report data on such a threatening issue and might help clinicians worldwide who will soon be dealing with the same challenges. \nPublisher's Note\nSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.\nCompliance with ethical standards\nConflict of interest\nThe authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.\nEthics approval\nThis retrospective chart review study involving human participants was in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards.\nInformed consent\nAdditional informed consent was obtained from all individual participants for whom identifying information is included in this article.\nReferences\nEmergenza Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19. https://www.regione.veneto.it/web/sanita/nuovo-coronavirus\nAlterations in smell or taste in mildly symptomatic outpatients with SARS-CoV-2 infection\nNew onset of loss of smell or taste in household contacts of home-isolated SARS-CoV-2-positive subjects\nClinical features of patients infected with, novel coronavirus in Wuhan\nInitial experiences from patients with COVID-19 on ventilatory support in Denmark\nBaseline characteristics and outcomes of 1591 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 admitted to ICUs of the Lombardy Region, Italy\nCharacteristics of and important lessons from the coronavirus disease, (COVID-19) outbreak in China: summary of a report of 72,314 cases from the chinese center for disease control and prevention\nEpidemiology, clinical course, and outcomes of critically ill adults with COVID-19 in New York City: a prospective cohort study\nRecommendation of a practical guideline for safe tracheostomy during the COVID-19 pandemic\nTracheostomy: epidemiology, indications, timing, technique, and outcomes\nTracheostomy in the intensive care unit: a university hospital in a developing country study\nLa tracheostomia in pazienti affetti da COVID-19. https://www.sioechcf.it/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/La-tracheostomia-in-pazienti-affetti-da-COVID-19.pdf\nThe effects of the COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 pandemic outbreak on otolaryngology activity in Italy\nGuidance for Surgical Tracheostomy and Tracheostomy Tube Change during the COVID-19 Pandemic. https://www.entuk.org/tracheostomy-guidance-during-covid-19-pandemic\nTracheotomy Recommendations During the COVID-19 Pandemic. https://www.entnet.org/content/tracheotomy-recommendations-during-covid-19pandemic\nSequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score. https://www.mdcalc.com/sequential-organ-failure-assessment-sofa-score\nD-dimer levels on admission to predict in-hospital mortality in patients with Covid-19\nRetrospective study of risk factors for severe SARS-Cov-2 infections in hospitalized adult patients\nClinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study\nClinical features and development of sepsis in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2: a retrospective analysis of 150 cases outside Wuhan, China\nEffect of early tracheostomy in mechanically ventilated patients\nTiming of tracheostomy in patients with prolonged endotracheal intubation: a systematic review\nCORONA-steps for tracheotomy in COVID-19 patients: a staff-safe method for airway management\nYu L (2020) Handbook of COVID-19 Prevention and Treatment\nSafe tracheostomy for patients with severe acute respiratorysyndrome\nTracheostomy in the COVID-19 pandemic\nWalking the line between benefit and harm from tracheostomy in COVID-19\nTracheostomy in the COVID-19 era: global and multidisciplinary guidance\nChina With The World: COVID-19 Experts Dialogues:The 2nd Talk Transcript. https://healthmanagement.org/c/icu/pressrelease/china-with-the-world-covid-19-experts-dialogues-the-2nd-talk-transcript\nTracheotomy task force, a working group of the airway safety committee of the university of pennsylvania health system.

the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41

associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.\n\n Increasing quartile of NLR was statistically significantly associated with secondary outcome.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR is associated with outcomes in unselected critically ill patients.\n\n In patients with sepsis, there was no statistically significant relationship between NLR and mortality.\n\n Further investigation is required to increase understanding of the

Data on the epidemiology, clinical course, and outcomes of critically ill patients with COVID-19 in this setting are needed.\n\n\nMethods\nThis prospective observational cohort study took place at two NewYork-Presbyterian hospitals affiliated with Columbia University Irving Medical Center in northern Manhattan.\n\n We prospectively identified adult patients (aged ?18 years) admitted to both hospitals from March 2 to April 1, 2020, who were diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and were critically ill with acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure, and collected clinical, biomarker, and treatment data.\n\n The primary outcome was the rate of in-hospital death.\n\n Secondary outcomes included frequency and duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, frequency of vasopressor use and renal replacement therapy, and time to in-hospital clinical deterioration following admission.\n\n The relation between clinical risk factors, biomarkers, and in-hospital mortality was modelled using Cox proportional hazards regression.\n\n Follow-up time was right-censored on April 28, 2020 so that each patient had at least 28 days of observation.\n\n\nFindings\nBetween March 2 and April 1, 2020, 1150 adults were admitted to both hospitals with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, of which 257 (22%) were critically ill.\n\n The median age of patients was 62 years (IQR 51–72), 171 (67%) were men.\n\n 212 (82%) patients had at least one chronic illness, the most common of which were hypertension (162 [63%]) and diabetes (92 [36%]).\n\n 119 (46%) patients had obesity.\n\n As of April 28, 2020, 101

were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing Municipal Science and Technology

Clinical information and laboratory findings, including IL-6 levels, were collected approximately 3 and 9 days after admission to be matched with preadministration and postadministration of TCZ.\n\n Multivariable logistic and linear regressions and survival analysis were performed depending on outcomes: need for IMV, evolution of arterial oxygen tension/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio, or mortality.\n\n\nResults\nOne hundred forty-six patients were studied, predominantly males (66%); median age was 63 years.\n\n Forty-four patients (30%) required IMV, and 58 patients (40%) received treatment with TCZ.\n\n IL-6 levels greater than 30 pg/mL was the best predictor for IMV (odds ratio, 7.1; P &lt; .\n\n001).\n\n Early administration of TCZ was associated with improvement in oxygenation (arterial oxygen tension/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio) in patients with high IL-6 (P = .\n\n048).\n\n Patients with high IL-6 not treated with TCZ showed high mortality (hazard ratio, 4.6; P = .\n\n003), as well as those with low IL-6 treated with TCZ (hazard ratio, 3.6; P = .\n\n016).\n\n No relevant serious adverse events were observed in TCZ-treated patients.\n\n\nConclusions\nBaseline IL-6 greater than 30 pg/mL predicts IMV requirement in patients with COVID-19 and contributes to establish an adequate indication for TCZ

inflammation-mediated lung injury and thereby reduce progression to respiratory failure and death.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this controlled, open-label trial comparing a range of possible treatments in patients who were hospitalized with Covid-19, we randomly assigned patients to receive oral or intravenous dexamethasone (at a dose of 6 mg once daily) for up to 10 days or to receive usual care alone.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality.\n\n Here, we report the preliminary results of this comparison.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 2104 patients were assigned to receive dexamethasone and 4321 to receive usual care.\n\n Overall, 482 patients (22.9%) in the dexamethasone group and 1110 patients (25.7%) in the usual care group died within 28 days after randomization (age-adjusted rate ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75 to 0.93; P&lt;0.001).\n\n The proportional and absolute between-group differences in mortality varied considerably according to the level of respiratory

survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

two methods: analysis of early versus late tracheostomy and landmark analysis.\n\n\nStudy Design\nRetrospective cohort study.\n\n\nMethods\nPatients who were emergently intubated and admitted into the intensive care unit or high dependency unit between January 2011 and August 2016, with or without tracheostomy, were included.\n\n In the early and late tracheostomy analysis, all patients were divided into early (?10?days, n =?88) and late (&gt;10?days, n?=?132) groups.\n\n In the landmark analysis, 198 patients requiring ventilation for more than 10?days were divided into early tracheostomy (?10?days, n?=?57) and nonearly tracheostomy (&gt;10?days, n?=?141) groups.\n\n We compared 60?day ventilation withdrawal rate and 60?day mortality.\n\n\nResults\nEarly tracheostomy was a significant factor for early ventilation withdrawal, as shown by log?rank test results (early and late tracheostomy: P =?.\n\n001, landmark: P?=?.\n\n021).\n\n Multivariable analysis showed that the early group was also associated with a higher chance of ventilation withdrawal in each analysis (early and late tracheostomy: adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]?=?1.69, 95% confidence interval

Patients","abstract":"Objective:\nTo determine the outcomes of patients undergoing tracheostomy for COVID-19 and of healthcare workers performing these procedures.\n\n\nBackground:\nTracheostomy is often performed for prolonged endotracheal intubation in critically ill patients.\n\n However, in the context of COVID-19, tracheostomy placement pathways have been altered due to the poor prognosis of intubated patients and the risk of transmission to providers through this highly aerosolizing procedure.\n\n\nMethods:\nA prospective single-system multi-center observational cohort study was performed on patients who underwent tracheostomy after acute respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19.\nResults:\nOf the 53 patients who underwent tracheostomy, the average time from endotracheal intubation to tracheostomy was 19.7 days?±?6.9 days.\n\n The most common indication for tracheostomy was acute respiratory distress syndrome, followed by failure to wean ventilation and post-extracorporeal membrane oxygenation decannulation.\n\n Thirty patients (56.6%) were liberated from the ventilator, 16 (30.2%) have been discharged alive, 7 (13.2%) have been decannulated, and 6 (11.3%) died.\n\n The average time from tracheostomy to ventilator liberation was 11.8 days?±?6.9 days (range 2–32 days).\n\n Both open surgical and percutaneous dilational tracheostomy techniques were performed utilizing methods to mitigate aerosols.\n\n No healthcare worker transmissions resulted from performing the procedure.\n\n\nConclusions:\nAlterations to tracheostomy practices and processes were successfully instituted.\n\n Following these steps, tracheostomy in COVID-19 intubated patients seems safe for both patients and healthcare workers performing the procedure.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7467054","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins","authors":[{"firstname":"Tiffany

controversial.\n\n\n\nPurpose\nIn a recent issue published in the European Archives of Otorhinolaryngology, Mattioli et al.\n\n published a short communication about tracheostomy timing in patients with COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019); they reported that the tracheostomy could allow early Intensive Care Units discharge and, in the context of prolonged Invasive Mechanical Ventilation, should be suggested within 7 and 14 days to avoid potential tracheal damages.\n\n In this Letter to the Editor we would like to present our experience with tracheostomy in a Hub Covid Hospital.\n\n\n\nMethods\n8 patients underwent open tracheostomy in case of intubation prolonged over 14 days, bronchopulmonary overlap infections, and patients undergoing weaning.\n\n They were followed up and the number and timing of death were recorded.\n\n\nResults\n\nTwo patients died after tracheostomy; the median time between tracheostomy and death was 3 days.\n\n A negative prognostic trend was observed for a shorter duration of intubation.\n\n\nConclusion\nIn our experience, tracheostomy does not seem to influence the clinical course and prognosis of the disease, in the face of possible risks of contagion for healthcare workers.\n\n The indication for tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients should be carefully evaluated and reserved for selected patients.\n\n Although it is not possible to define an optimal timing, it is our opinion that tracheostomy in a stable or clinically improved COVID-19 patient should not be proposed before the 20th day after orotracheal intubation.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7250256","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Springer Berlin

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020.

novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12

with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

characteristics and outcomes of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 treated in Hubei (epicentre) and outside Hubei (non-epicentre): a nationwide analysis of China","abstract":"Background\nDuring the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), consistent and considerable differences in disease severity and mortality rate of patients treated in Hubei province compared to those in other parts of China have been observed.\n\n We sought to compare the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients being treated inside and outside Hubei province, and explore the factors underlying these differences.\n\n\nMethods\nCollaborating with the National Health Commission, we established a retrospective cohort to study hospitalised COVID-19 cases in China.\n\n Clinical characteristics, the rate of severe events and deaths, and the time to critical illness (invasive ventilation or intensive care unit admission or death) were compared between patients within and outside Hubei.\n\n The impact of Wuhan-related exposure (a presumed key factor that drove the severe situation in Hubei, as Wuhan is the epicentre as well the administrative centre of Hubei province) and the duration between symptom onset and admission on prognosis were also determined.\n\n\nResults\nAt the data cut-off (31 January 2020), 1590 cases from 575 hospitals in 31 provincial administrative regions were collected (core cohort).\n\n The overall rate of severe cases and mortality was 16.0% and 3.2%, respectively.\n\n Patients in Hubei (predominantly with Wuhan-related exposure, 597 (92.3%) out of 647) were older (mean age 49.7 versus 44.9?years), had more cases with comorbidity (32.9% versus 19.7%), higher symptomatic burden, abnormal radiologic manifestations and, especially, a longer waiting time between symptom onset and admission (5.7 versus 4.5?days) compared with patients outside Hubei.\n\n Patients in Hubei (severe event rate 23.0% versus 11.1%, death rate 7.3% versus 0.3%, HR (95% CI) for critical illness 1.59 (1.05–2.41)) have a poorer prognosis compared with patients outside Hubei after adjusting for age and comorbidity.\n\n However, among patients outside Hubei, the duration from symptom onset to hospitalisation (mean 4.4 versus 4.7?days) and prognosis (HR (95%) 0.84 (0.40–1.80)) were similar between patients with or without Wuhan-related exposure.\n\n In the overall population, the waiting time, but neither treated in Hubei nor Wuhan-related exposure, remained an independent prognostic factor (HR (95%) 1.05 (1.01–1.08)).\n\n\nConclusion\nThere were more severe cases and poorer outcomes for COVID-19 patients treated in Hubei, which might be attributed to the prolonged duration of symptom onset to hospitalisation in the epicentre.\n\n Future studies to determine the reason for delaying hospitalisation are warranted.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7144336","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"European Respiratory

ventilation due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n The requirement for relatively long periods of ventilation in those who survive means that many are considered for tracheostomy to free patients from ventilatory support and maximise scarce resources.\n COVID-19 provides unique challenges for tracheostomy care: health-care workers need to safely undertake tracheostomy procedures and manage patients afterwards, minimising risks of nosocomial transmission and compromises in the quality of care.\n Conflicting recommendations exist about case selection, the timing and performance of tracheostomy, and the subsequent management of patients.\n In response, we convened an international working group of individuals with relevant expertise in tracheostomy.\n We did a literature and internet search for reports of research pertaining to tracheostomy during the COVID-19 pandemic, supplemented by sources comprising statements and guidance on tracheostomy care.\n By synthesising early experiences from countries that have managed a surge in patient numbers, emerging virological data, and international, multidisciplinary expert opinion, we aim to provide consensus guidelines and recommendations

(ST), and if one PT technique is superior to the others.\n\n\nMethods\nComputerized databases (1966 to 2013) were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting complications as predefined endpoints and comparing PT and ST and among the different PT techniques in mechanically ventilated adult critically ill patients.\n\n Odds ratios (OR) and mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI), and I2 values were estimated.\n\n\nResults\nFourteen RCTs tested PT techniques versus ST in 973 patients.\n\n PT techniques were performed faster (MD, ?13.06 minutes (95% CI, ?19.37 to ?6.76 (P &lt;0.0001)); I2?=?97% (P &lt;0.00001)) and reduced odds for stoma inflammation (OR, 0.38 (95% CI, 0.19 to 0.76 (P?=?0.006)); I2?=?2% (P?=?0.36)), and infection (OR, 0.22 (95% CI, 0.11 to

health agencies.\n\n The objective of the review was to provide evidence that a.\n\n) demonstrates which otolaryngology procedures are aerosol-generating, and that b.\n\n) clarifies whether the higher level of PPE advocated by otolaryngology groups is justified.\n\n\nMain body\nid='Par2'>Health care workers in China who performed tracheotomy during the SARS-CoV-1 epidemic had 4.15 times greater odds of contracting the virus than controls who did not perform tracheotomy (95% CI 2.75–7.54).\n\n No other studies provide direct epidemiological evidence of increased aerosolized transmission of viruses during otolaryngology procedures.\n\n Experimental evidence has shown that electrocautery, advanced energy devices, open suctioning, and drilling can create aerosolized biological particles.\n\n The viral load of COVID-19 is highest in the upper aerodigestive tract, increasing the likelihood that aerosols generated during procedures of the upper aerodigestive tract of infected patients would carry viral material.\n\n Cough and normal breathing create aerosols which may increase the risk of transmission during outpatient procedures.\n\n A significant proportion of individuals infected with COVID-19 may not have symptoms, raising the likelihood of transmission of the disease to inadequately protected health care workers from patients who do not have probable or

principle, even though the evidence is not definitive, adopting enhanced personal protective equipment protocols is reasonable based on the evidence.\n\n Further research is needed to clarify the risk

thus, the artificial airway must be managed by tracheotomy.\n\n Therefore, studies exploring appropriate and safe methods for tracheotomy that minimize the risks of nosocomial transmission are important.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA retrospective analysis of the clinical characteristics of 14 critically ill patients with COVID-19, who underwent bedside tracheotomy from March to April 2020 was conducted to summarize the indications for tracheotomy and key points related to personal protective equipment and surgical procedures.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAll 14 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 and were critically ill.\n\n All tracheotomies were performed in the late phase of the infection course.\n\n The interval between the infection and tracheotomy was 33?days, and the median interval between intubation and tracheotomy was 25.5?days.\n\n The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction results of secretions from the operative incision and inside the tracheotomy tube were negative.\n\n Twelve patients improved after tracheotomy, with SpO2 levels maintained above 96%.\n\n One patient died of progressive respiratory failure; another patient died of uncontrolled septic shock.\n\n No medical staff who participated in the tracheotomy was infected.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nTracheotomy in critically ill patients with COVID-19 who meet the indications for tracheotomy potentially represents a safer approach to manage the airway and help improve the treatment outcomes.\n\n A tracheotomy performed in the late phase of the disease has a relatively low risk of infection.\n\n Adherence to key steps in the tracheotomy procedure and donning adequate personal protection will help medical staff avoid infection.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7543369","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Oxford University Press","authors":[{"firstname":"Surita","surname":"Aodeng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Weiqing","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yu","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guodong","surname":"Feng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jian","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Lv","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hua","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xin","surname":"Ding","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kaicheng","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sirui","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiazhen","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shuyang","surname":"Zhang","email":"talllee@sina.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhiqiang","surname":"Gao","email":"talllee@sina.com","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1177/0194599820961985","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Tracheostomy during the COVID-19 pandemic: comparison of international perioperative care protocols and practices in 26 countries","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1002/hed.26191","date":"2020-04-09","title":"Tracheostomy guidelines developed at a large academic medical center during the <styled-content style='fixed-case' toggle='no'>COVID</styled-content>?19 pandemic","abstract":"Background\nDuring the SARS?CoV?2 pandemic, tracheostomy may be required for COVID?19 patients requiring long?term ventilation in addition to other conditions such as airway compromise from head and neck cancer.\n\n As an aerosol?generating procedure, tracheostomy increases the exposure of health care workers to COVID?19 infection.\n\n Performing surgical tracheostomy and tracheostomy care requires a strategy that mitigates these risks and maintains the quality of patient care.\n\n\nMethods\nThis study is a multidisciplinary review of institutional tracheostomy guidelines and clinical pathways.\n\n Modifications to support clinical decision making in the context of COVID?19 were derived by consensus and available evidence.\n\n\nResults\nModified guidelines for all phases of tracheostomy care at an academic tertiary care center in the setting of COVID?19 are presented.\n\n\nDiscussion\nDuring the various phases of the COVID?19 pandemic, clinicians must carefully consider the indications, procedural precautions, and postoperative care for tracheostomies.\n\n We present guidelines to mitigate risk to health care workers while preserving the quality of care.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7264650","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley &amp;

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

Second and Third Wave of 1918–1919 Influenza Pandemic","abstract":"Background\nIt is widely accepted that the shift in case-fatality rate between waves during the 1918 influenza pandemic was due to a genetic change in the virus.\n\n In animal models, the infectious dose of influenza A virus was associated to the severity of disease which lead us to propose a new hypothesis.\n\n We propose that the increase in the case-fatality rate can be explained by the dynamics of disease and by a dose-dependent response mediated by the number of simultaneous contacts a susceptible person has with infectious ones.\n\n\nMethods\nWe used a compartment model with seasonality, waning of immunity and a Holling type II function, to model simultaneous contacts between a susceptible person and infectious ones.\n\n In the model, infected persons having mild or severe illness depend both on the proportion of infectious persons in the population and on the level of simultaneous contacts between a susceptible and infectious persons.\n\n We further allowed for a high or low rate of waning immunity and volunteer isolation at different times of the epidemic.\n\n\nResults\nIn all scenarios, case-fatality rate was low during the first wave (Spring) due to a decrease in the effective reproduction number.\n\n The case-fatality rate in the second wave (Autumn) depended on the ratio between the number of severe cases to the number of mild cases since, for each 1000 mild infections only 4 deaths occurred whereas for 1000 severe infections there were 20 deaths.\n\n A third wave (late Winter) was dependent on the rate for waning immunity or on the introduction of new susceptible persons in the community.\n\n If a group of persons became voluntarily isolated and returned to the community some days latter, new waves occurred.\n\n For a fixed number of infected persons the overall case-fatality rate decreased as the number of waves increased.\n\n This is explained by the lower proportion of infectious individuals in each wave that prevented an increase in the number of severe infections and thus of the case-fatality rate.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe increase on the proportion of infectious persons as a proxy for the increase of the infectious dose a susceptible person is exposed, as the epidemic develops, can explain the shift in case-fatality rate between waves during the 1918 influenza pandemic.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2909907","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"A.

For half of the subjects, viral plaque assays were performed on the nasopharyngeal swabs and cough aerosol samples to determine if viable virus was present.\n Fifty-eight subjects were tested, of whom 47 were positive for influenza virus by qPCR.\n Influenza viral RNA was detected in coughs from 38 of these subjects (81%).\n Thirty-five percent of the influenza RNA was contained in particles &gt;4 µm in aerodynamic diameter, while 23% was in particles 1 to 4 µm and 42% in particles &lt;1 µm.\n Viable influenza virus was detected in the cough aerosols from 2 of 21 subjects with influenza.\n These results show that coughing by influenza patients emits aerosol particles containing influenza virus and that much of the viral RNA is contained within particles in the respirable size range.\n The results support the idea that the airborne route may be a pathway for influenza transmission, especially in the immediate vicinity of an influenza patient.\n Further research is needed on the viability of airborne influenza viruses and the risk of transmission.\n","id":"PMC2994911","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"William G.","surname":"Lindsley","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Francoise M.","surname":"Blachere","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Robert E.","surname":"Thewlis","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Abhishek","surname":"Vishnu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kristina A.","surname":"Davis","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gang","surname":"Cao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jan E.","surname":"Palmer","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Karen E.","surname":"Clark","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Melanie A.","surname":"Fisher","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rashida","surname":"Khakoo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Donald H.","surname":"Beezhold","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Andrew","surname":"Pekosz","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Andrew","surname":"Pekosz","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1164/rccm.201203-0444OC","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Variability of infectious aerosols produced during coughing by patients with pulmonary tuberculosis","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Hassan SM, Trotter MI.

Introduction\nThe novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As a result of its highly infectious nature and rapid spread, COVID-19 is ravaging health systems worldwide. Although the majority of individuals experience mild symptoms, the sheer volume of cases caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has led to an incredibly high number of critically ill patients requiring long-term intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation (MV), with prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) stay and sedation requirements.\nBefore the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, it was common practice in the ICU setting to stratify time to tracheostomy based on distinct definitions of &quot;early&quot; and &quot;late&quot;. Time to tracheostomy is influenced by several factors, including patient and family expectations, predicted outcomes, and the likelihood of weaning from mechanical ventilation. Early tracheostomy was considered helpful in shortening the duration of MV, with the advantage of increasing patient comfort while reducing sedation requirements. However, there is little evidence to support that early versus late tracheostomy improves survival, shortens the duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay or reduces lower respiratory tract infections in general ICU patients.\nSimilar considerations can be made for surgical versus percutaneous tracheostomy techniques. A randomized controlled trial in general ICU patients investigating differences between the two and their effects on outcome and short-long term complications found a higher rate of systemic infectious complications in the surgical group compared to the percutaneous group, but the difference did not reach statistical significance. Similar rates of ventilator-associated pneumonia with surgical and percutaneous techniques have been reported. In short, to date, there is no evidence to support a definitive recommendation of one technique over the other.\nIn COVID-19 cases, the possible complications derived from prolonged endotracheal intubation should be weighed against the risk of viral exposure of hospital staff during aerosol-generating procedures. The high rate of failed weaning from the ventilator and failed endotracheal extubation in COVID-19 suggests a potential need for early tracheostomy, since it may help shorten the weaning phase and reduce the rate of associated complications. Recent guidelines on the management of tracheostomy in COVID-19 recommend using surgical instead of percutaneous techniques to limit aerosol and droplet exposure, although limited data are available on the comparison of these techniques in the COVID-19 population.\nBased on the foregoing, the primary endpoint of this study was the median time to tracheostomy in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Secondary endpoints were the comparative impacts of early versus late tracheostomy and surgical versus percutaneous tracheostomy on survival, length of ICU stay, and post-tracheostomy complications. Several patient characteristics of interest were also assessed, including weaning attempts before tracheostomy and ventilatory settings on days 1, 7, 15, and the day of tracheostomy.\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Study Design\nThis was an observational, retrospective, multicenter study conducted in 11 Italian ICUs (Supplementary Materials, SM) coordinated by the Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care, San Martino Policlinico Hospital, IRCCS for Oncology and Neuroscience, Genoa, Italy.\nThis study was reviewed and approved by the relevant Institutional Review Board (Comitato Etico Regione Liguria, Italy, N. 163/2020; San Martino Policlinico Hospital, IRCCS for Oncology and Neuroscience, Genoa, Italy). Written informed consent was waived due to the retrospective nature of the study. This report follows the STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) recommendations.\n2.2. Patient Selection, Inclusion, and Exclusion Criteria\nWeanTrach enrolled critically ill patients with a positive real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) nasopharyngeal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), admitted to the study ICUs, who underwent surgical or percutaneous tracheostomy.\nWe excluded patients who did not receive tracheostomy and those aged &lt;18 years. Patients were included between 20 April and 30 June 2020.\nPercutaneous dilatational tracheostomies were primarily performed at the bedside in the ICUs by intensivists, whereas the specialist head and neck surgeons performed surgical tracheostomies in patients with difficult anatomy or other presumed obstacles to percutaneous technique. Open tracheostomies were mostly performed in the operating theater, and occasionally at the bedside in the ICU as necessary.\n2.3. Data Collection\nData were collected from electronic medical records as part of routine ICU care. Access to the data was managed by the coordinating center.\nData of interest included demographic and past medical history from the day of hospital admission to the day of hospital discharge. The following demographic information was collected: age in years, gender, body mass index (BMI), history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic respiratory disease (defined as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma), chronic renal disease (defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt;30 mL/min/1.73 m2), chronic liver disease (defined as acute or chronic compensated or decompensated liver cirrhosis), chronic heart disease (defined as a history of current or previous cardiac dysfunction), cancer or hematological malignancy, smoking (defined as a current or former smoker), and chronic neurologic disease (any disease of the brain, spinal cord, peripheral neuropathy, cranial nerve disorder, autonomic nervous system disorder, seizure disorder, movement disorder, migraine, central neuropathy, neuropsychiatric illness).\nRespiratory settings were collected for both invasively and non-invasively ventilated patients. Parameters included type of ventilation [conventional oxygen therapy (COT), non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIMV), invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV)], type of IMV (pressure-controlled ventilation, volume-controlled ventilation, assisted ventilation), ventilator settings [tidal volume, respiratory rate, plateau pressure, minute ventilation, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2)], and blood gas parameters [partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2), partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2), pHa, PaO2/FiO2 ratio, bicarbonates, lactates], recorded at days 1, 7, 15, and on the day of tracheostomy.\nTime to tracheostomy, time to weaning, time to extubation, time to ICU admission, time from symptom onset to hospital admission, time to endotracheal intubation, the reason for tracheostomy, and date of ICU discharge were collected.\nIn-ICU events of interest included duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU length of stay, post-tracheostomy ICU length of stay, complications derived from surgical or percutaneous tracheostomy techniques [including hemorrhage, tracheostomy stoma infection, lower respiratory tract infection (defined as positive bronchoalveolar lavage fluid), stenosis, thrombosis, death], the reason for death, and microorganisms found in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) before and after tracheostomy.\n2.4. Definitions\nEarly tracheostomy was defined as a tracheostomy performed within the first 15 days after endotracheal intubation, while late tracheostomy was defined as a tracheostomy performed &gt;= 15 days after endotracheal intubation. The reason for selecting 15 days as the cut-off for early and late tracheostomy was based on the median time to tracheostomy performance in our cohort.\nTime to tracheostomy was defined as the time elapsed from endotracheal intubation to tracheostomy.\nTime to weaning was defined as the time from endotracheal intubation to the first spontaneous breathing trial (SBT).\nSBT was defined as the first attempt to reduce respiratory support before extubation (removal of endotracheal tube and respiratory support). The execution of a SBT did not automatically lead to extubation.\nTime to extubation was defined as the time between the insertion and the removal of an artificial airway such as an endotracheal tube or tracheostomy tube.\nExtubation was defined as the removal of an artificial airway. This term was used either for the removal of an endotracheal tube or tracheostomy tube.\nTime to ICU admission was defined as the time from hospital admission to ICU admission.\nTime to endotracheal intubation in ICU was defined as the time from ICU admission to endotracheal intubation.\nICU discharge was defined as the last day of ICU stay, irrespective of death or discharge to another non-ICU ward.\nLength of ICU stay was defined as the time between ICU admission and ICU discharge, irrespective of death or discharge to another non-ICU ward.\nPost-tracheostomy ICU length of stay was considered as the time between tracheostomy and ICU discharge.\nReasons for tracheostomy were categorized as follows: prolonged weaning expected, neurological impairment (inability to maintain patient airways because of neurological condition), extubation failure (failure of SBT and/or extubation needing re-intubation), and airway failure (inability to maintain patient airways because of upper airway causes).\n2.5. Statistical Analysis\nNo sample size calculation was performed because of the exploratory, descriptive, and retrospective nature of this study. For descriptive summary statistics, variables were reported as mean (standard deviation), median (range), or absolute and relative frequencies, as appropriate.\nThe Mann-Whitney U test was applied to evaluate differences in ICU length of stay between groups (surgical versus percutaneous tracheostomy, late versus early timing). The estimation of any association between complications of tracheostomy and type of intervention (surgical versus percutaneous) was assessed with a preliminary univariate analysis (chi-square test with Yates correction or Fisher's exact test), followed by a multivariate logistic regression model adjusted for all the baseline variables. The same approach was used with tracheostomy timing (early versus late) as a dependent variable. Time to survival was analyzed with Kaplan-Meier estimates; the log-rank test was used for comparison between groups.\nTwo-sided p-values &lt;= 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All analyses were performed using SPSS  version 25.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).\n3. Results\nOverall characteristics at hospital and ICU admission of the 153 tracheostomized COVID-19 patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria are reported in Table 1. Other characteristics of patients at hospital and ICU admission are reported in Table S1.\nCharacteristics of medical treatments and ventilatory management on days 1, 7, and 15 after ICU admission and on the day of tracheostomy are reported in Table S2 and Table S3, respectively.\nThe median time to tracheostomy was 15 (1-64) days. Seventy-six (49.67%) patients underwent early tracheostomy, while 77 (50.33%) underwent late tracheostomy.\nPercutaneous tracheostomy was more frequent than open (surgical) techniques (n = 100, 65.36% versus n = 53, 34.64%, respectively).\nThe reasons for tracheostomy included inability to be weaned from the ventilator (n = 143, 93.5%), neurological impairment (n = 5, 3.3%), extubation failure (n = 2, 1.3%), airway failure (n = 1, 0.7%), and were unspecified in 2 patients (1.3%). Thirty (19.6%) patients ultimately underwent tracheostomy closure.\nWeaning from the ventilator was mainly performed by using the spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) technique in pressure-support ventilation mode (N = 84, 54.9%).\nThe median time from endotracheal intubation to SBT was 12.0 (1.0-35.0) days. The median time from endotracheal intubation to extubation from the endotracheal tube was 12.0 (1.0-28.0) days, whereas the median time from extubation from the endotracheal tube to tracheostomy was 13.0 (1.0-52.0) days.\nNineteen patients were ultimately extubated from the endotracheal tube before tracheostomy, while 133 were never extubated before tracheostomy (missing N = 1 patient). Among those who were extubated, 4 (21.1%) underwent early tracheostomy, while 15 (78.9%) underwent late tracheostomy. Among those never extubated from the endotracheal tube before tracheostomy, 71 (53.4%) underwent early tracheostomy, while 62 (46.6%) underwent late tracheostomy (p = 0.008). Finally, all the included 153 patients underwent tracheostomy.\nAfter tracheostomy, 85 (55.6%) patients gradually become free of an artificial airway (10 of them died during ICU stay, 1 patient missing data); 49 (32.0%) patients were never extubated from the tracheostomy tube and all of them died during ICU stay, while data of 19 (12.4%) patients were missing.\nA higher rate of tracheostomy closure was found in patients who underwent a surgical versus percutaneous tracheostomy (OR 4.23; 95% CI 1.00-17.86, p = 0.049).\n3.1. Cumulative Probability of Survival\nThe cumulative probability of survival in the overall population is shown in Figure S1. Timing and causes of death are reported in Table S4. The cumulative probability of survival in critically ill COVID-19 patients did not differ between those who received an early tracheostomy and those who were tracheostomized later (p = 0.84). Figure 1 shows the cumulative probability of survival after early or late tracheostomy at follow-up (up to 60 days).\nThe probability of survival after tracheostomy did not differ significantly between patients who received surgical versus percutaneous tracheostomy (p = 0.66), as shown in Figure 2.\nThe probability of survival did not differ significantly between patients who received early versus late surgical tracheostomy, and early versus late percutaneous tracheostomy (Figures S2 and S3).\n3.2. ICU Length of Stay\nEarly tracheostomy resulted in shorter overall ICU stay (time between ICU admission and ICU discharge) when compared to late tracheostomy [median 24.0 (5.0-98.0) versus 46.0 (16.0-133.0) days, p &lt; 0.001]. Similarly, percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy resulted in shorter overall ICU stay when compared to surgical tracheostomy [median 30.0 (5.0-133.0) versus 40.0 (20.0-103.0) days, p = 0.050].\nWhen considering post-tracheostomy ICU length of stay (from the day of tracheostomy to the day of ICU discharge), the median length of stay for those undergoing early and late tracheostomy was 15.0 (1.0-82.0) days and 22.5 (1.0-86.0) days, respectively (p = 0.031).\nAgain, percutaneous compared to surgical tracheostomy resulted in shorter ICU length of stay [median 16.0 (1.0-82.0) days and 24.0 (6.0-86.0) days, respectively], but not significantly so (p = 0.070).\n3.3. Post-Tracheostomy Complications\nComplications after early and late tracheostomy, as well as in surgical and percutaneous tracheostomy groups, are reported in Table 2. The most common pathogens identified in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid before and after tracheostomy are reported in Table S5.\n4. Discussion\nFew studies comparing early and late and surgical and percutaneous tracheostomy techniques in COVID-19 have been published to date.\nIn our cohort of tracheostomized critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, we found that: (1) the median time to tracheostomy was 15 (1-64) days; (2) there was no difference in survival in patients who received tracheostomy before or after 15 days, nor between surgical and percutaneous techniques; (3) early and percutaneous tracheostomy did not improve outcomes, but was associated with shorter ICU stay; (4) post-tracheostomy infection of the lower respiratory tract were less frequent with percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy than with surgical techniques.\n4.1. Timing and Type of Tracheostomy\nOur data on COVID-19 subjects revealed a median time to tracheostomy of 15 (1-64) days. This was set as the cut-off for defining the early and late time of tracheostomy. In fact, 76 (49.67%) patients underwent early tracheostomy, while 77 (50.33%) patients underwent late tracheostomy. Additionally, in our cohort of critically ill COVID-19 patients, percutaneous tracheostomy was performed in 100 patients, while surgical tracheostomy was performed in 53 patients. Of importance, although considered as a secondary endpoint, 19 patients were extubated (all of them reintubated), while 133 were never extubated before tracheostomy. Among those who were extubated, 21.1% underwent early tracheostomy, while 78.9% underwent late tracheostomy (p = 0.008). This can be interpreted as the extubation followed by re-intubation could have influenced the time of tracheostomy and ICU length of stay.\nConventionally, tracheostomy is performed in general ICU patients with ongoing mechanical ventilation up to 3 weeks after endotracheal intubation, with an increasing tendency to reduce the time to tracheostomy. Studies and meta-analyses investigating the effect of tracheostomy timing on clinical outcomes have reported variable results. In patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the mean time to tracheostomy is 14 days, while 10 days is considered as a conventional cut-off for early versus late tracheostomy in general ICU patients.\nSeveral national protocols and international guidelines have published guidance on the management of tracheostomy in COVID-19, despite the scarcity of evidence in the literature. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the mean time to tracheostomy has often been longer than usual. Kwak et al. reported a mean time of 12.2 days, very close to that reported in a prospective observational study of 100 tracheostomized COVID-19 patients in the United Kingdom (13.9 +- 4.5 days). In a cohort of 270 mechanically ventilated patients, of whom 98 underwent percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy, the mean time to tracheostomy was 10.6 +- 5 days, shorter than that reported by Tang et al. and Chao et al..\nAs shown in the COVID-19 literature, the timing of tracheostomy must strike a balance between possible risks to clinicians and optimal outcomes for patients. Information on the massive viral load and high infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 appears to have led to delays or even avoidance of tracheostomy in this population. In the early stage of ICU admission (within 7 days after endotracheal intubation), the literature on general non-COVID-19 patients agrees concerning the possible deferment of more aggressive treatment approaches, thus limiting the potential favorable effects of tracheostomy over the possible risk of periprocedural complication. This has been emphasized in COVID-19, since during the early phase of the disease, patients can present with a higher viral load, increasing the risk of infection of health care providers. Several meta-analyses of studies conducted in non-COVID-19 patients have concluded that percutaneous techniques are performed more quickly than surgical tracheostomy. This is even more important in the COVID-19 setting, in which the time of operator exposure to the virus takes on a pivotal role; open surgical techniques are presumed to pose a greater risk to the operator, thus requiring more caution.\n4.2. Cumulative Probability of Survival\nIn our study, we find no differences in survival in patients who received tracheostomy before or after 15 days. Moreover, survival did not differ significantly between patients who received early versus late surgical tracheostomy, and early versus late percutaneous tracheostomy.\nRosano et al. investigated if early percutaneous tracheostomy (cut-off 10 days) was independently associated with increased hospital mortality. Tracheostomized patients significantly died more than non-tracheostomized. However, this study did not investigate survival between early and late tracheostomies, being of limited interest for our aims. In a smaller report of 29 COVID-19 patients, early tracheostomy did not influence mortality. As reported by Kwak et al. and Shultz et al., late tracheostomy did not significantly influence survival in studies that assessed this parameter, which is in line with our findings. As for surgical and percutaneous tracheostomies and survival, no data are available in the literature, making our study the first one assessing this endpoint. Nevertheless, we strongly believe that length of stay is a more interesting outcome to assess in this patient population.\n4.3. Length of ICU Stay\nIn our study, early tracheostomy was associated with a shorter overall ICU stay. This should be highlighted since the ICU stay might be considered as a better outcome than survival in COVID-19 patients. It also resulted as being of significance when considering &quot;tracheostomy-ICU stay&quot;, suggesting that the time of tracheostomy might have influenced ICU length of stay. Of interest also was that percutaneous tracheostomy shortened ICU stay significantly as compared to surgical tracheostomy, but it was not confirmed when &quot;tracheostomy-ICU stay&quot; was considered.\nIn studies including non-COVID-19 patients, early tracheostomy was associated with shorter overall ICU stay, shorter duration of sedation, and reduced long-term mortality when compared to late tracheostomy. However, despite its advantages, early tracheostomy in general ICU patients is not clearly supported by the literature.\nIn the abovementioned report of 29 COVID-19 patients, early tracheostomy did not influence ICU length of stay. Conversely, the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham COVID-19 airway team reported a shorter ICU length of stay for early compared to late tracheostomy (cut-off at 14 days), with p &lt; 0.0001. Differently from our study, significance in ICU length of stay was not identified when considering &quot;tracheostomy-ICU stay&quot;. Controversially, Kwak et al. calculated the overall-ICU length of stay (between the day of ICU admission and the day of ICU discharge), missing results on the possible intervention of tracheostomy to this endpoint.\n4.4. Post-Tracheostomy Complications\nIn our study, the time to tracheostomy did not significantly influence the rate of complications. Additionally, surgical tracheostomy was associated with significantly lower respiratory tract infections than percutaneous tracheostomy. The pathogens most commonly identified before and after tracheostomy included Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans, and Acinetobacter baumannii.\nMassick et al. reported a higher incidence of complications with percutaneous technique than open surgical tracheostomy. Similarly, Silvester et al. reported a higher incidence of bleeding requiring surgical intervention in the percutaneous group, while infections were more frequent in the surgical group. Antonelli et al., in a randomized controlled trial, found higher rates of systemic infectious complications in the surgical group than in the percutaneous groups (more positive pharyngeal swabs and tracheal aspirates and blood cultures), but the difference was not significant. Terragni et al. reported similar rates of ventilator-associated pneumonia between surgically and percutaneously tracheostomized patients. Likewise, Sole et al. reported no significant differences in lower respiratory tract infections before and after dilatational percutaneous tracheostomy (52% pre and 48% post).\nFew studies investigated the type and rate of complications in the non-COVID-19 population. The impact of the time of tracheostomy on complications might be considered of great interest in COVID-19, as the time of disease represents a pivotal parameter to understand the hyperinflammatory state and coagulation disorders typical of certain stages of COVID-19 disease.\nTwo recent studies reported that in their cohorts of 201 and 100 tracheostomized COVID-19 patients respectively, of whom 124 and 70 underwent percutaneous tracheostomies, while 77 and 30 underwent surgical tracheostomies, no differences in the rate of perioperative complications were found. In the smaller of these cohorts, 26 (55.3%) patients experienced stoma infection, hemorrhage, and subcutaneous emphysema. Botto et al. reported local infections, hemorrhage, and subcutaneous emphysema in 52.9% after percutaneous tracheostomy, versus 60.0% after surgical tracheostomy. However, complication rates were not significantly different between groups. The pathogens identified in the smaller cohort of 30 COVID-19 patients were slightly different from those identified in our sample. In another study, delayed complications of tracheostomy included cuff leaks and bleeding at the stoma site. Picetti et al., in 66 COVID-19 ICU patients who underwent tracheostomy, reported stoma infection and hemorrhage as the most common complications and the time to tracheostomy as &quot;very early&quot; (around 6 days). Tang et al. reported tracheostoma bleeding as the leading complication [14 (17.5%)], with major bleeding occurring in 4 patients (5.0%), but with a time to tracheostomy performance of 17.5 days. As abovementioned, this may be explained by the variety of clinical presentations of COVID-19 coagulopathy. In fact, antithrombotic treatment and the natural history of the disease itself may lead to hemorrhagic or pro-coagulative complications, especially in the early phase, with an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines, coagulation disorders, and endothelial and microvascular cell damage, that may be variable in timing and presentation. Therefore, the choice to delay tracheostomy in this patient population seems reasonable at face value. However, COVID-19 is often associated with longer ventilator time than expected, more patient-ventilator asynchronies, and a more difficult and longer weaning phase than in non-COVID-19 critical illness. Finally, the fact that prolonged mechanical ventilation is associated with more complications and longer ICU stay suggests that early tracheostomy should be deployed more widely in this patient cohort. Finally, we might conclude that percutaneous tracheostomy seems to cause fewer infectious complications than surgical techniques, both in COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 cohorts, although it is associated with a higher risk of bleeding.\n4.5. Limitations\nSeveral limitations of the present study must be addressed. First, due to its retrospective nature, some key statistical tests could not be performed, and significant biases may have affected patient selection. Second, temporal relationships are frequently difficult to assess. Third, retrospective studies often need very large sample sizes to detect rare outcomes. Even if a patient is ready for ICU discharge, &quot;time of ICU discharge&quot; may not be the same as &quot;time of ICU discharge decision&quot; due to organizational problems. Additionally, no data on general complications were collected (including polyneuropathy or critical illness), but only data concerning complications related to tracheostomy as interest for our primary and secondary endpoints, while a huge amount of data concerning the management of neuromuscular paralysis were missing, as expected in a retrospective study. In fact, most of the centers could not have been retrospectively accessed as to the reason for percutaneous or surgical tracheostomy, therefore potentially influencing outcomes.\n5. Conclusions\nIn critically ill COVID-19 patients, the median time to tracheostomy was longer than described in non-COVID-19 subjects. The timing and type of tracheostomy did not affect survival but did shorten overall-ICU stay (shorter for early and percutaneous tracheostomy), even when considering &quot;tracheostomy-ICU stay&quot;. Post-tracheostomy infection of the lower respiratory tract was less frequent with percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy than with the surgical technique. A randomized multicenter trial is warranted and clearly needed to elucidate the potential benefit of early and percutaneous tracheostomy in critically ill, mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients.\nPublisher's Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.\nSupplementary Materials\nThe following are available online at : List of participating centers [p. 2].

some 15% will develop severe complaints and among them, many will lose their lives.\n A large number of patients do not have overt signs and symptoms (fever/respiratory), yet pose a real risk to surgeons (who should know this fact and must therefore apply respiratory protective strategies for all patients they encounter).\n All interventions that have the potential to aerosolize aerodigestive secretions should be avoided or used only when mandatory.\n Health workers who are: pregnant, over 55 to 65?years of age, with a history of chronic diseases (uncontrolled hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, and all clinical scenarios where immunosuppression is feasible, including that induced to treat chronic inflammatory conditions and organ transplants) should avoid the clinical attention of a potentially infected patient.\n Health care facilities should prioritize urgent and emergency visits and procedures until the present condition stabilizes; truly elective care should cease and discussed on a case?by?case basis for patients with cancer.\n For those who are working with COVID?19 infected patients' isolation is compulsory in the following settings: (a) unprotected close contact with COVID?19 pneumonia patients; (b) onset of fever, cough, shortness of breath, and other symptoms (gastrointestinal complaints, anosmia, and dysgeusia have been reported in a minority of cases).\n For any care or intervention in the upper aerodigestive tract region, irrespective of the setting and a confirmed diagnosis (eg, rhinoscopy or flexible laryngoscopy in the outpatient setting and tracheostomy or rigid endoscopy under anesthesia), it is strongly recommended that all health care personnel wear personal protective equipment such as N95, gown, cap, eye protection, and gloves.\n The procedures described are essential in trying to maintain safety of health care workers during COVID?19 pandemic.\n In particular, otolaryngologists, head and neck, and maxillofacial surgeons are per se exposed to the greatest risk of infection while caring for COVID?19 positive subjects, and their protection should be considered a priority in the present circumstances.\n","id":"PMC7262203","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley &amp;

guidance","abstract":"Global health care is experiencing an unprecedented surge in the number of critically ill patients who require mechanical ventilation due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n The requirement for relatively long periods of ventilation in those who survive means that many are considered for tracheostomy to free patients from ventilatory support and maximise scarce resources.\n COVID-19 provides unique challenges for tracheostomy care: health-care workers need to safely undertake tracheostomy procedures and manage patients afterwards, minimising risks of nosocomial transmission and compromises in the quality of care.\n Conflicting recommendations exist about case selection, the timing and performance of tracheostomy, and the subsequent management of patients.\n In response, we convened an international working group of individuals with relevant expertise in tracheostomy.\n We did a literature and internet search for reports of research pertaining to tracheostomy during the COVID-19 pandemic, supplemented by sources comprising statements and guidance on tracheostomy care.\n By synthesising early experiences from countries that have managed a surge in patient numbers, emerging virological data, and international, multidisciplinary expert opinion, we aim to provide consensus guidelines and recommendations on the conduct and management of tracheostomy during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n","id":"PMC7228735","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Brendan

other clinical departments (72.2%) rather than emergency department (3.7%) or medical technology departments (18.5%).\n Among the 54 patients with COVID?19, the distribution of age had a significant difference between non?severe type and severe/critical cases (median age: 47 years vs 38 years; P?=?.\n0015).\n However, there was no statistical difference in terms of gender distribution and the

The dynamics of antibodies with the disease progress was analyzed.\n\n\nResults\nAmong 173 patients, the seroconversion rate for Ab, IgM and IgG was 93.1%, 82.7% and 64.7%, respectively.\n\n The reason for the negative antibody findings in 12 patients might due to the lack of blood samples at the later stage of illness.\n\n The median seroconversion time for Ab, IgM and then IgG were day-11, day-12 and day-14, separately.\n\n The presence of antibodies was &lt;40% among patients within 1-week since onset, and rapidly increased to 100.0% (Ab), 94.3% (IgM) and 79.8% (IgG) since day-15 after onset.\n\n In contrast, RNA detectability decreased from 66.7% (58/87) in samples collected before day-7 to 45.5% (25/55) during day 15-39. Combining RNA and antibody detections significantly improved the sensitivity of pathogenic diagnosis for COVID-19 (p&lt;0.001), even in early phase of 1-week since onset (p=0.007).\n\n Moreover, a higher titer of Ab was independently associated with a worse clinical classification (p=0.006).\n\n\nConclusions\nThe antibody detection offers vital clinical information during the course of

critically ill adult patients: a meta-analysis","abstract":"Introduction\nThe aim of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis to determine whether percutaneous tracheostomy (PT) techniques are advantageous over surgical tracheostomy (ST), and if one PT technique is superior to the others.\n\n\nMethods\nComputerized databases (1966 to 2013) were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting complications as predefined endpoints and comparing PT and ST and among the different PT techniques in mechanically ventilated adult critically ill patients.\n\n Odds ratios (OR) and mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI), and I2 values were estimated.\n\n\nResults\nFourteen RCTs tested PT techniques versus ST in 973 patients.\n\n PT techniques were performed faster (MD, ?13.06 minutes (95% CI, ?19.37 to ?6.76 (P &lt;0.0001)); I2?=?97% (P &lt;0.00001)) and reduced odds for stoma inflammation (OR, 0.38 (95% CI, 0.19 to 0.76 (P?=?0.006)); I2?=?2% (P?=?0.36)), and infection (OR, 0.22 (95% CI, 0.11 to 0.41 (P &lt;0.00001)); I2?=?0% (P?=?0.54)), but increased odds for procedural technical difficulties (OR, 4.58 (95% CI, 2.21 to 9.47 (P &lt;0.0001)); I2?=?0% (P?=?0.63)).\n\n PT techniques reduced odds for postprocedural major bleeding (OR, 0.39 (95% CI, 0.15 to 0.97 (P?=?0.04)); I2?=?0% (P?=?0.69)), but not when a single RCT using translaryngeal tracheostomy was excluded (OR, 0.58 (95% CI, 0.21 to 1.63 (P?=?0.30)); I2?=?0% (P?=?0.89)).\n\n Eight RCTs compared different PT techniques in 700 patients.\n\n Multiple (MDT) and single step (SSDT) dilatator techniques are associated with the lowest odds for difficult dilatation or cannula insertion (OR, 0.30 (95% CI, 0.12 to 0.80 (P?=?0.02)); I2?=?56% (P?=?0.03)) and major intraprocedural bleeding (OR, 0.29 (95% CI, 0.10 to 0.85 (P?=?0.02)); I2?=?0% (P?=?0.72)), compared to the guide wire dilatation forceps technique.\n\n\nConclusion\nIn critically ill adult patients, PT techniques can be performed faster and reduce stoma inflammation and infection but are associated with increased technical difficulties when compared to ST.\n\n Among PT techniques, MDT and SSDT were associated with the lowest intraprocedural risks and seem to be preferable.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13054-014-0544-7) contains

critically ill patients yet the optimal method of performing tracheostomies in this population remains to be established.\n\n The aim of this study was to systematically review and quantitatively synthesize all randomized clinical trials (RCTs), comparing elective percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT) and surgical tracheostomy (ST) in adult critically ill patients with regards to major short and long term outcomes.\n\n\nMethods\nMEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and the Cochrane Controlled Clinical Trials Register databases were searched to identify relevant studies.\n\n Additionally, bibliographies and selected conference proceedings were reviewed, and experts in the field and manufacturers of two PDT kits were contacted.\n\n Randomized clinical trials comparing any method of elective PDT to ST that included critically ill adults and reported at least one clinically relevant outcome were included.\n\n Data extracted included trial characteristics, measures of study validity, and clinically relevant outcomes.\n\n\nResults\nSeventeen RCTs involving 1,212 patients were included.\n\n Most PDTs used a multiple dilator technique and were performed in the intensive care unit (ICU).\n\n The pooled odds ratio (OR) for wound infection was 0.28 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.16 to 0.49, p &lt; 0.0005), indicating a significant reduction with PDT compared to ST.\n\n Overall, PDT was equivalent to ST for bleeding, major peri-procedural and long-term complications; however, subgroup analysis suggested PDT resulted in a lower incidence of bleeding (OR = 0.29 (95% CI 0.12 to 0.75, p = 0.01)) and death (OR = 0.71 (95% CI 0.50 to 1.0, p = 0.05)) when the STs were performed in the operating theatre.\n\n\nConclusion\nPDT reduces the overall incidence of wound infection and may further reduce clinical relevant bleeding and mortality when compared with ST performed in the operating theatre.\n\n PDT, performed in the ICU, should be considered the procedure of choice for performing elective tracheostomies in critically ill adult patients.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1550905","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

tracheostomy (ST), and if one PT technique is superior to the others.\n\n\nMethods\nComputerized databases (1966 to 2013) were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting complications as predefined endpoints and comparing PT and ST and among the different PT techniques in mechanically ventilated adult critically ill patients.\n\n Odds ratios (OR) and mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI), and I2 values were estimated.\n\n\nResults\nFourteen RCTs tested PT techniques versus ST in 973 patients.\n\n PT techniques were performed faster (MD, ?13.06 minutes (95% CI, ?19.37 to ?6.76 (P &lt;0.0001)); I2?=?97% (P &lt;0.00001)) and reduced odds for stoma inflammation (OR, 0.38 (95% CI, 0.19 to 0.76 (P?=?0.006)); I2?=?2% (P?=?0.36)), and infection (OR, 0.22 (95% CI,

the lowest odds for difficult dilatation or cannula insertion (OR, 0.30 (95% CI, 0.12 to 0.80 (P?=?0.02)); I2?=?56% (P?=?0.03)) and major intraprocedural bleeding (OR, 0.29 (95% CI, 0.10 to 0.85

A total of 100 patients (mean [standard deviation] age: 55 [12] yr; 29% female) underwent tracheostomy; 64 (age: 57 [14] yr; 25% female) did not undergo tracheostomy.\n\n Despite similar APACHE-II scores, 30-day survival was higher in 85/100 (85%) patients after tracheostomy, compared with 27/64 (42%) non-tracheostomised patients {relative risk: 3.9 (95% confidence intervals [CI]: 2.3–6.4); P&lt;0.0001}.\n\n In patients with APACHE-II scores ?17, 68/100 (68%) tracheotomised patients survived, compared with 12/64 (19%) non-tracheotomised patients (P&lt;0.001).\n\n Tracheostomy within 14 days of intubation was associated with shorter duration of ventilation (mean difference: 6.0 days [95% CI: 3.1–9.0]; P&lt;0.0001) and ICU stay (mean difference: 6.7 days [95% CI: 3.7–9.6]; P&lt;0.0001).\n\n No healthcare workers developed COVID-19.\nConclusion\nIndependent of the severity of critical illness from COVID-19, 30-day survival was higher and ICU stay shorter in patients receiving tracheostomy.\n\n Early tracheostomy appears to be safe in COVID-19.\n","id":"PMC7455111","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"British Journal of Anaesthesia.

caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).\n\n Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (?18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.\n\n\nFindings\n191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital.\n\n 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients).\n\n Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·03–1·17, per year increase; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·61–12·23; p&lt;0·0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL (18·42, 2·64–128·55; p=0·0033) on admission.\n\n Median duration of viral shedding was 20·0 days (IQR 17·0–24·0) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors.\n\n The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage.\n\n Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.\n\n\nFunding\nChinese Academy of Medical Sciences Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences; National Science Grant for Distinguished Young Scholars; National Key

often performed for prolonged endotracheal intubation in critically ill patients.\n\n However, in the context of COVID-19, tracheostomy placement pathways have been altered due to the poor prognosis of intubated patients and the risk of transmission to providers through this highly aerosolizing procedure.\n\n\nMethods:\nA prospective single-system multi-center observational cohort study was performed on patients who underwent tracheostomy after acute respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19.\nResults:\nOf the 53 patients who underwent tracheostomy, the average time from endotracheal intubation to tracheostomy was 19.7 days?±?6.9 days.\n\n The most common indication for tracheostomy was acute respiratory distress syndrome, followed by failure to wean ventilation and

Patients","abstract":"Objective:\nTo determine the outcomes of patients undergoing tracheostomy for COVID-19 and of healthcare workers performing these procedures.\n\n\nBackground:\nTracheostomy is often performed for prolonged endotracheal intubation in critically ill patients.\n\n However, in the context of COVID-19, tracheostomy placement pathways have been altered due to the poor prognosis of intubated patients and the risk of transmission to providers through this highly aerosolizing procedure.\n\n\nMethods:\nA prospective single-system multi-center observational cohort study was performed on patients who underwent tracheostomy after acute respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19.\nResults:\nOf the 53 patients who underwent tracheostomy, the average time from endotracheal intubation to tracheostomy was 19.7 days?±?6.9 days.\n\n The most common indication for tracheostomy was acute respiratory distress syndrome, followed by failure to wean ventilation and post-extracorporeal membrane oxygenation decannulation.\n\n Thirty patients (56.6%) were liberated from the ventilator, 16 (30.2%) have been discharged alive, 7 (13.2%) have been decannulated, and 6 (11.3%) died.\n\n The average time from tracheostomy to ventilator liberation was 11.8 days?±?6.9 days (range 2–32 days).\n\n Both open surgical and percutaneous dilational tracheostomy techniques were performed utilizing methods to mitigate aerosols.\n\n No healthcare worker transmissions resulted from performing the procedure.\n\n\nConclusions:\nAlterations to tracheostomy practices and processes were successfully instituted.\n\n Following these steps, tracheostomy in COVID-19 intubated patients seems safe for both patients and healthcare workers performing the procedure.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7467054","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins","authors":[{"firstname":"Tiffany

controversial.\n\n\n\nPurpose\nIn a recent issue published in the European Archives of Otorhinolaryngology, Mattioli et al.\n\n published a short communication about tracheostomy timing in patients with COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019); they reported that the tracheostomy could allow early Intensive Care Units discharge and, in the context of prolonged Invasive Mechanical Ventilation, should be suggested within 7 and 14 days to avoid potential tracheal damages.\n\n In this Letter to the Editor we would like to present our experience with tracheostomy in a Hub Covid Hospital.\n\n\n\nMethods\n8 patients underwent open tracheostomy in case of intubation prolonged over 14 days, bronchopulmonary overlap infections, and patients undergoing weaning.\n\n They were followed up and the number and timing of death were recorded.\n\n\nResults\n\nTwo patients died after tracheostomy; the median time between tracheostomy and death was 3 days.\n\n A negative prognostic trend was observed for a shorter duration of intubation.\n\n\nConclusion\nIn our experience, tracheostomy does not seem to influence the clinical course and prognosis of the disease, in the face of possible risks of contagion for healthcare workers.\n\n The indication for tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients should be carefully evaluated and reserved for selected patients.\n\n Although it is not possible to define an optimal timing, it is our opinion that tracheostomy in a stable or clinically improved COVID-19 patient should not be proposed before the 20th day after orotracheal intubation.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7250256","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Springer Berlin

trauma patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs), its timing remains subject to considerable practice variation.\n\n The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of early tracheostomy on the duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU length of stay, and outcomes in trauma ICU patients.\n\n\nMethods\nThe following data were obtained from a prospective ICU database containing information on all trauma patients who received tracheostomy over a 5-year period: demographics, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II, Glasgow Coma Scale score, Injury Severity Score, type of injuries, ICU and hospital outcomes, ICU and hospital length of stay (LOS), and the type of tracheostomy procedure (percutaneous versus surgical).\n\n Tracheostomy was considered early if it was performed by day 7 of mechanical ventilation.\n\n We compared the duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU LOS and outcome between early and late tracheostomy patients.\n\n Multivariate analysis was performed to assess the impact of tracheostomy timing on ICU stay.\n\n\nResults\nOf 653 trauma ICU patients, 136 (21%) required tracheostomies, 29 of whom were early and 107 were late.\n\n Age, sex, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II and Injury Severity Score were not different between

significantly shorter with early tracheostomy (mean ± standard error: 9.6 ± 1.2 days versus 18.7 ± 1.3 days; P &lt; 0.0001).\n\n Similarly, ICU LOS was significantly shorter (10.9 ± 1.2 days versus

ICU and hospital mortality rates were similar.\n\n Using multivariate analysis, late tracheostomy was an independent predictor of prolonged ICU stay (&gt;14 days).\n\n\nConclusion\nEarly tracheostomy in trauma ICU patients is associated with shorter duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU LOS, without affecting ICU or hospital outcome.\n\n Adopting a standardized strategy of early tracheostomy

not affect reducing sedation requirements of patients in intensive care – a retrospective study","abstract":"Introduction\nTranslaryngeal intubated and ventilated patients often need sedation to treat anxiety, agitation and/or pain.\n\n Current opinion is that tracheotomy reduces sedation requirements.\n\n We determined sedation needs before and after tracheotomy of intubated and mechanically ventilated patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed a retrospective analysis of the use of morphine, midazolam and propofol in patients before and after tracheotomy.\n\n\nResults\nOf 1,788 patients admitted to our intensive care unit during the study period, 129 (7%) were tracheotomized.\n\n After the exclusion of patients who received a tracheotomy before or at the day of admittance, 117 patients were left for analysis.\n\n The daily dose (DD; the amount of sedatives for each day) divided by the mean daily dose (MDD; the mean amount of sedatives per day for the study period) in the week before and the week after tracheotomy was 1.07 ± 0.93 DD/MDD versus 0.30 ± 0.65 for morphine, 0.84 ± 1.03 versus 0.11 ± 0.46 for midazolam, and 0.62 ± 1.05 versus 0.15 ± 0.45 for propofol (p &lt; 0.01).\n\n However, when we focused on a shorter time interval (two days before and after tracheotomy), there were no differences in prescribed doses of morphine and midazolam.\n\n Studying the course in DD/MDD from seven days before the placement of tracheotomy, we found a significant decline in dosage.\n\n From day -7 to day -1, morphine dosage (DD/MDD) declined by 3.34 (95% confidence interval -1.61 to -6.24), midazolam dosage by 2.95 (-1.49 to -5.29) and propofol dosage by 1.05 (-0.41 to -2.01).\n\n After tracheotomy, no further decrease in DD/MDD was observed and the dosage remained stable for all sedatives.\n\n Patients in the non-surgical and acute surgical groups received higher dosages of midazolam than patients in the elective surgical group.\n\n Time until tracheotomy did not influence sedation requirements.\n\n In addition, there was no significant difference in sedation between different patient groups.\n\n\nConclusion\nIn our intensive care unit, sedation requirements were not further reduced after tracheotomy.\n\n Sedation requirements were already sharply declining before tracheotomy was performed.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1751026","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Denise

Patients with Acute Distress Respiratory Syndrome: A Critical Review","abstract":"In critically ill patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a high incidence of thromboembolic and hemorrhagic events is reported.\n COVID-19 may lead to impairment of the coagulation cascade, with an imbalance in platelet function and the regulatory mechanisms of coagulation and fibrinolysis.\n Clinical manifestations vary from a rise in laboratory markers and subclinical microthrombi to thromboembolic events, bleeding, and disseminated intravascular coagulation.\n After an inflammatory trigger, the mechanism for activation of the coagulation cascade in COVID-19 is the tissue factor pathway, which causes endotoxin and tumor necrosis factor-mediated production of interleukins and platelet activation.\n The consequent massive infiltration of activated platelets may be responsible for inflammatory infiltrates in the endothelial space, as well as thrombocytopenia.\n The variety of clinical presentations of the coagulopathy confronts the clinician with the difficult questions of whether and how to provide optimal supportive care.\n In addition to coagulation tests, advanced laboratory tests such as protein C, protein S, antithrombin, tissue factor pathway inhibitors, D-dimers, activated factor Xa, and quantification of specific coagulation factors can be useful, as can thromboelastography or thromboelastometry.\n Treatment should be tailored, focusing on the estimated risk of bleeding and thrombosis.\n The aim of this review is to explore the pathophysiology and clinical evidence of coagulation disorders in severe ARDS-related COVID-19

rehabilitation patients","abstract":"Background:\nA patient's infectivity is determined by the presence of the virus in different body fluids, secretions, and excreta.\n\n The persistence and clearance of viral RNA from different specimens of patients with 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) remain unclear.\n\n This study analyzed the clearance time and factors influencing 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) RNA in different samples from patients with COVID-19, providing further evidence to improve the management of patients during convalescence.\n\n\nMethods:\nThe clinical data and laboratory test results of convalescent patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to from January 20, 2020 to February 10, 2020 were collected retrospectively.\n\n The reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results for patients’ oropharyngeal swab, stool, urine, and serum samples were collected and analyzed.\n\n Convalescent patients refer to recovered non-febrile patients without respiratory symptoms who had two successive (minimum 24 h sampling interval) negative RT-PCR results for viral RNA from oropharyngeal swabs.\n\n The effects of cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4)+ T lymphocytes, inflammatory indicators, and glucocorticoid treatment on viral nucleic acid clearance were analyzed.\n\n\nResults:\nIn the 292 confirmed cases, 66 patients recovered after treatment and were included in our study.\n\n In total, 28 (42.4%) women and 38 men (57.6%) with a median age of 44.0 (34.0–62.0) years were analyzed.\n\n After in-hospital treatment, patients’ inflammatory indicators decreased with improved clinical condition.\n\n The median time from the onset of symptoms to first negative RT-PCR results for oropharyngeal swabs in convalescent patients was 9.5 (6.0–11.0) days.\n\n By February 10, 2020, 11 convalescent patients (16.7%) still tested positive for viral RNA from stool specimens and the other 55 patients’ stool specimens were negative for 2019-nCoV following a median duration of 11.0 (9.0–16.0) days after symptom onset.\n\n Among these 55 patients, 43 had a longer duration until stool specimens were negative for viral RNA than for throat swabs, with a median delay of 2.0 (1.0–4.0) days.\n\n Results for only four (6.9%) urine samples were positive for viral nucleic acid out of 58 cases; viral RNA was still present in three patients’ urine specimens after throat swabs were negative.\n\n Using a multiple linear regression model (F?=?2.669, P?=?0.044, and adjusted R2?=?0.122), the analysis showed that the CD4+ T lymphocyte count may help predict the duration of viral RNA detection in patients’ stools (t?=??2.699, P?=?0.010).\n\n The duration of viral RNA detection from oropharyngeal swabs and fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group (15 days vs.\n\n 8.0 days, respectively; t?=?2.550, P?=?0.013) and the duration of viral RNA detection in fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group (20 days vs.\n\n 11 days, respectively; t?=?4.631, P?&lt;?0.001).\n\n There was no statistically significant difference in inflammatory indicators between patients with positive fecal viral RNA test results and those with negative results (P?&gt;?0.05).\n\n\nConclusions:\nIn brief, as the clearance of viral RNA in patients’ stools was delayed compared to that in oropharyngeal swabs, it is important to identify viral RNA in feces during convalescence.\n\n Because of the delayed clearance of viral RNA in the glucocorticoid treatment group, glucocorticoids are not recommended in the treatment of COVID-19, especially for mild disease.\n\n The duration of RNA detection may relate to host cell immunity.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7147278","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Wolters Kluwer

from standard care to the use of therapeutic anticoagulation for enhanced thromboprophylaxis (ET).\n\n Local ET protocols have been empirically determined and are generally intermediate between standard prophylaxis and full anticoagulation.\n\n Concerns have been raised in regard to the potential risk of haemorrhage associated with therapeutic anticoagulation.\n\n This report describes the prevalence and safety of ET strategies in European Intensive Care Unit (ICUs) and their association with outcomes during the first wave of the COVID pandemic, with particular focus on haemorrhagic complications and ICU mortality.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>Retrospective, observational, multi-centre study including adult critically ill COVID-19 patients.\n\n Anonymised data included demographics,

embolism, represent an important source of adverse outcomes in coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19).\n\n\nObjectives\nTo assess the frequency of arterial and venous thromboembolic disease, risk factors, prevention and management patterns, and outcomes in patients with COVID-19, the authors designed a multicenter, observational cohort study.\n\n\nMethods\nWe analyzed a retrospective cohort of 1,114 patients with COVID-19 diagnosed through our Mass General Brigham integrated health network.\n\n The total cohort was analyzed by site of care: intensive care (n = 170); hospitalized nonintensive care (n = 229); and outpatient (n = 715).\n\n The primary study outcome was a composite of adjudicated major arterial or venous thromboembolism.\n\n\nResults\nPatients with COVID-19 were 22.3% Hispanic/Latinx and 44.2% non-White.\n\n Cardiovascular risk factors of hypertension (35.8%), hyperlipidemia (28.6%), and diabetes (18.0%) were common.\n\n Prophylactic anticoagulation was prescribed in 89.4% of patients with COVID-19 in the intensive care cohort and 84.7% of those in the hospitalized nonintensive care setting.\n\n Frequencies of major arterial or venous thromboembolism, major cardiovascular adverse events, and symptomatic venous thromboembolism were highest in the intensive care cohort (35.3%, 45.9%, and 27.0 %, respectively) followed by the hospitalized nonintensive care cohort (2.6%, 6.1%, and 2.2%, respectively) and the outpatient cohort (0% for all).\n\n\nConclusions\nMajor arterial or venous thromboembolism, major adverse cardiovascular events, and symptomatic venous thromboembolism occurred with high frequency in patients with COVID-19, especially in the intensive care setting, despite a high utilization rate of thromboprophylaxis.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7588178","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"The Authors.

April 15, 2020, 270 patients with COVID-19 required invasive mechanical ventilation at New York University Langone Health Manhattan’s campus; of those, 98 patients underwent percutaneous dilational tracheostomy.\n\n The mean time from intubation to the procedure was 10.6 ± 5 days.\n\n Currently, 32 patients (33%) do not require mechanical ventilatory support, 19 (19%) have their tracheostomy tube downsized, and 8 (8%) were decannulated.\n\n Forty patients (41%) remain on full ventilator support, and 19 (19%) are weaning from mechanical ventilation.\n\n Seven patients (7%) died as a result of respiratory and multiorgan failure.\n\n Tracheostomy-related bleeding was the most common complication (5 patients).\n\n None of health care providers has had symptoms or tested positive for COVID-19.\nConclusions\nOur percutaneous tracheostomy technique appears to be safe and effective for COVID-19 patients and safe for health care workers.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7182508","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons Published by

Archives of Otorhinolaryngology, Mattioli et al.\n\n published a short communication about tracheostomy timing in patients with COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019); they reported that the tracheostomy could allow early Intensive Care Units discharge and, in the context of prolonged Invasive Mechanical Ventilation, should be suggested within 7 and 14 days to avoid potential tracheal damages.\n\n In this Letter to the Editor we would like to present our experience with tracheostomy in a Hub Covid Hospital.\n\n\n\nMethods\n8 patients underwent open tracheostomy in case of intubation prolonged over 14 days, bronchopulmonary overlap infections, and patients undergoing weaning.\n\n They were followed up and the number and timing of death were recorded.\n\n\nResults\n\nTwo patients died after tracheostomy; the median time between tracheostomy and death was 3 days.\n\n A negative prognostic trend was observed for a shorter duration of intubation.\n\n\nConclusion\nIn our experience, tracheostomy does not seem to influence the clinical course and prognosis of the disease, in the face of possible risks of contagion for healthcare workers.\n\n The indication for tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients should be carefully evaluated and reserved for selected patients.\n\n Although it is not possible to define an optimal timing, it is our opinion that tracheostomy in a stable or clinically improved COVID-19 patient should not be proposed before the 20th day after orotracheal intubation.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7250256","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Springer Berlin

Early tracheostomy appears to be safe in COVID-19.\nEditor's key points\nThe role of tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19 is unclear, with some non-evidence-based guidelines advising against this practice.\nIn a prospective observational cohort study, the authors report outcomes after tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients at a major UK institution where a coordinated education programme supported safe discharge of tracheostomised patients from the ICU.\nA total of 100/164 patients underwent tracheostomy safely, with no transmission of COVID-19 infection in healthcare workers involved in their care.\nDespite similar characteristics and APACHE II scores, 30-day survival was higher after tracheostomy compared with non-tracheotomised patients [relative risk of surviving after tracheostomy: 3.9 (95% confidence intervals [CI]: 2.3-6.4)].\nEarly tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients appears to be safe and associated with a shorter ICU stay.\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a worldwide pandemic spreading to more than 213 countries, and affecting more than six million people worldwide. Although the majority of individuals experience mild symptoms, approximately 10-17% develop acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring invasive mechanical ventilation.   In the UK, Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre (ICNARC) data have reported a mortality rate up to 40.4% in patients admitted to intensive care. \nBefore the onset of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, early tracheostomy was considered helpful in shortening the duration of ventilation and length of stay in ICUs for any patient requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation.   Although the evidence base for tracheostomy improving overall survival remains unclear, a lower incidence of pneumonia with early tracheostomy was suggested by a recent meta-analysis. Tracheostomy decreases sedation requirements, avoids pressure-induced trauma (both to the trachea and oral cavity), and may reduce the severe physical deconditioning associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation. However, the role and timing of tracheostomy for patients requiring critical care for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is unclear.\nThe emergence of SARS-CoV-2 necessitated the rapid development of guidelines, predominantly based on expert opinion. Early guidelines from both the UK and national bodies proposed a cautious approach to tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19:avoiding before 10 days of intubation and giving serious consideration before performing at all between 10 and 21 days after intubation, allowing for a sufficient decline in viral load. Recommendations were also made for patients to test negative before proceeding with a tracheostomy, and that healthcare workers should wear powered respirators; a scarce resource in many settings.   Later guidelines from an international working group highlighted the need to balance potential risks against benefits of weaning patients from invasive ventilation.   These guidelines were also based on expert opinion and highlighted the need for robust ICU outcome data.\nThe evolution of a multidisciplinary COVID-19 airway team at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, with surgical, anaesthetic, critical care, and speech and language therapy (SLT) representation occurred at the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the UK. We developed agreed parameters for patient selection, procedural strategies, weaning/decannulation policies, organisational re-configuration, and training for managing tracheostomy patients on discharge from critical care. This report describes patient selection, survival, complications, and safety to healthcare workers for the first 100 COVID-19 cases undergoing tracheostomy at our large tertiary hospital.\nMethods\nEthical approval\nThis study was a service evaluation (Supplementary material). All data were routinely recorded contemporaneously on to the hospital electronic systems and then retrospectively analysed.\nSetting\nAll patients admitted to the ICU with severe respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, UK, from March 9, 2020 to April 21, 2020 were included. SARS-CoV-2 positivity was confirmed by real time polymerase chain reaction testing of nasopharyngeal swabs or non-directed bronchial lavage/aspirate.\nTracheostomy team\nThe daily tracheostomy team comprised two head and neck surgeons along with an Operating Department Practitioner (ODP). Critical care and anaesthetic clinicians managed the tracheal tube during tracheostomy insertion and ensured adequate sedation and paralysis. All procedures were performed in personal protective equipment (PPE) for aerosol-generating procedures, as defined by Public Health England (FFP3 masks with fluid repellent gowns, gloves, and eye protection). No powered respirators were worn by the tracheostomy team and negative pressure rooms were not used in ICUs or operating theatres.\nPatient selection\nParameters used by the COVID-19 airway team to guide patient selection for tracheostomy.\nTable 1	 	\nIsolated respiratory failure except for acute renal failure on dialysis or continuous renal replacement therapy	 	Prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation for 10 or more days	 	Multiple failed sedation holds, failed extubation, or anticipated prolonged respiratory wean	 	Improving oxygen requirements: fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) &lt;0.4 and PEEP&lt;10 cm H2O.	 	Appropriate coagulation with no evidence of coagulopathy	 	Unlikely to require further prone position ventilation	 	\nPrimary extubation was the preferred option for all patients, with tracheostomy considered when this was deemed not possible. Through multidisciplinary agreement, parameters to guide selection for tracheostomy were defined before the study period (Table 1 ). Patients with physiology outside of these parameters were still considered for tracheostomy on a case-by-case basis. The decision regarding tracheostomy was made by a multidisciplinary team (MDT) of critical care physicians, anaesthetists, and surgeons. Acute Physiology and Chronic Health (APACHE II) scores were calculated for patients on admission to ICU but did not form part of the decision-making process for tracheostomy. With a dedicated 24 h on call tracheostomy service competent in percutaneous and surgical techniques, and access to dedicated COVID emergency theatres, the choice of performing a surgical or percutaneous tracheostomy depended only on patient body habitus, adequate neck extension, and grade of direct laryngoscopy.\nDecannulation protocol\nDecannulation was not a prerequisite for discharge from the ICU. Decannulation while on the ICU was performed as a multidisciplinary decision between critical care staff and SLT. Where patients were discharged to the ward with a tracheostomy in situ, a ward-based decannulation protocol was used. This decision was made autonomously by the tracheostomy MDT (SLT, physiotherapy, and Clinical Nurse Specialist).\nTraining and institutional reconfiguration\nTo create operational readiness, an MDT led by SLT provided comprehensive education and clinical support to personnel outside of ICU caring for tracheostomised patients. All staff on receiving wards received theoretical and practical training (the latter comprising simulation training observed by the trainers). A standardised intensive training was provided over 68 sessions for 829 members of nursing, therapy, and medical staff, delivered by experienced staff who manage tracheostomy patients regularly. Staff were trained to manage inner tube changes, suction, humidification, tape changes, and cuff pressure. An online MoodleTM training module allowed staff to refresh if anxious, and ward-based practical training was provided when required. Further clinical support was provided by the ear, nose, and throat nurses deployed to the three specialist tracheostomy wards to support unfamiliar staff. A robust and detailed governance framework supported this work stream.\nPrimary clinical outcome\nThe primary outcome measure was 30-day survival (from date of ICU admission), compared between tracheotomised patients and those who had no tracheostomy (primarily extubated).\nSecondary outcomes\nSecondary outcome measures were time to waking after ceasing sedation, duration of sedation and mechanical ventilation, discharge from ICU, tracheostomy decannulation rate, and complications. The endpoint for ventilatory support was defined as when the patient wore a tracheostomy mask for at least 24 h.\nSensitivity analyses\nThirty-day survival was compared for patients with APACHE scores of &lt;17 and &gt;17, based on this threshold being relevant in other studies.   Guidelines had raised concerns about performing tracheostomy before day 10, and suggested performing after day 14 may be preferable. Subgroup analyses were therefore performed based on these cut-offs to explore whether these timings affected survival, time on ventilator, and length of ICU stay.\nStatistics\nData were analysed using XLSTAT (Addinsoft, New York, USA) and IBM SPSS Statistics (version 26; IBM Corp, Armonk, NY). The distribution of continuous variables was tested using the one-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, and if normal, variables were presented as mean (standard deviation [sd]). Means of two continuous, normally distributed variables were compared by an independent Student's t-test. Frequencies of categorical variables were compared using the chi test. A P-value &lt;0.05 was considered significant. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to assess survival with significance calculated using the log rank test.\nResults\nPatient characteristics\nCharacteristics of patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).

One hundred patients (61%) underwent a tracheostomy during this period. Twenty-seven (16%) patients were extubated without the need for a tracheostomy. Baseline characteristics are shown in Table 2 . All patients were intubated on admission to the ICU. The 30-day survival was worse in 19/42 (45%) patients with an APACHE-II score of &gt;=17 compared with 93/122 (76%) with a score &lt;17 (relative risk [RR]: 2.3, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.5-3.5, P=0.0001).\nCharacteristics of patients with tracheostomy\nThe time from intubation to tracheostomy ranged from 5 to 29 days (Table 2). Seventy-five patients underwent percutaneous tracheostomy in the ICU, while 25 underwent surgical tracheostomy in the operating theatre. Patients undergoing open tracheostomy had significantly higher BMI. The indications for tracheostomy were failed extubation (13%), failed sedation hold (52%), anticipated prolonged respiratory wean (32%), and severe facial oedema from prone-positioning (3%). APACHE II scores were similar between patients who underwent, or avoided, tracheostomy (Table 2).\nPrimary outcome: 30-day survival\nThe 30-day survival for the whole cohort was 68.3% (112/164). The 30-day survival was higher in patients who received a tracheostomy compared with those that did not 85/100 (85%) vs 27/64 (42%), (RR: 3.9, 95% CI: 2.3-6.4 P&lt;0.0001).\nKaplan-Meier plot for 30-day survival from date of intubation.

For 14/20 (68%) patients with APACHE II score&gt;=17, tracheostomy was associated with higher survival at 30 days, compared with 4/22 (19%) patients who did not undergo tracheostomy (RR: 2.7, 95% CI: 1.4-5.5, P=0.005) (Fig. 1 ).\nSecondary outcomes\nTiming of tracheostomy and survival\nNine patients underwent tracheostomy before 10 days, 55 between 10 and 14 days, and 36 after 14 days of intubation. There was no difference in survival between those undergoing tracheostomy before or after day 10 (11% vs 15%, respectively, P=0.73), or before or after day 14 (19% vs 12%, respectively, P=0.18).\nDuration of ventilatory support\nVentilatory/recovery data for patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).

Total duration of ventilatory support and mean ventilator duration are presented in Table 3 . For surviving patients, tracheostomy at &lt;=14 days was associated with reduced duration of ventilatory support compared with tracheostomy at &gt;14 days (21 [6.0] days, vs 27 [6.3] days, P=0.0001). There was no difference between the groups in time from tracheostomy to 24 h tracheostomy mask. Three patients required prone-position ventilation after tracheostomy because of deterioration of oxygenation, with none of this group surviving past 30 days. These patients had not required prone-positioning for at least 48 h before tracheostomy, and although they appeared to be progressing well after tracheostomy, they had a deterioration in oxygenation at 72, 96, and 96 h, respectively.\nLength of critical care stay\nThose patients who underwent successful extubation had a mean length of ICU stay of 12 (5.4) days. Tracheostomy before 14 days was associated with shorter length of ICU stay compared with tracheostomy after 14 days (23 [5.6] days vs 30 [6.7] days, respectively, P&lt;0.0001). There was no difference between the groups in time from tracheostomy to discharge from critical care. All surviving tracheostomised patients were successfully discharged from the ICU, and 97% were discharged from hospital at 60 days. The mean overall length of hospital stay for surviving tracheostomised patients was 34 (8.9) days and for surviving primarily extubated patients was 16 (9.5) days.\nTracheostomy complications\nComplications in the 77 percutaneous tracheostomies performed included self-limiting bleeding (n=3), false passage (n=2), and conversion to surgical tracheostomy (n=2). Complications in the 25 surgically inserted tracheostomies were self-limiting bleeding (n=1), tube dislodgement (n=1), and air leak postoperatively (n=2). Late complications encountered included two cases of vocal cord palsy, the aetiology of which was uncertain.\nSedation weaning outcomes\nAll 85 surviving tracheostomy patients underwent weaning from sedation. Sedation was stopped within 48 h of tracheostomy insertion in 65/85 patients (76.5%) and within 96 h in 10/85 (12%). Sedation hold was delayed &gt;96 h in 10/85 (12%) because of worsening oxygenation (n=5) or delirium (n=5). Once sedation was ceased, 63/85 (74%) patients regained consciousness (Richmond-Agitation-Sedation-Score [RASS] score of -1, 0, or 1) within 24 h, or within 72 h in 79/85 (93%). The remaining six patients regained consciousness between 4 and 21 days after ceasing sedation. Four of those patients were diagnosed with COVID-related encephalopathy, and the remaining two had multiple cerebral infarcts.\nDecannulation\nDecannulation was successfully completed in 84/85 surviving patients (99%). The mean time to decannulation for all tracheostomy patients was 14 (7.9) days with no difference seen between the early vs late tracheostomy groups (13 vs 15 days, P=0.72). Out of the 84 decannulated patients, 41 (49%) were decannulated without downsizing the tube or tube fenestration. Downsizing was required in 25 (30%) patients, whereas downsizing and fenestration were needed in 18 (21%) to support their weaning.\nHealthcare worker safety\nDuring the study period, none of the tracheostomy, SLT, or ODP teams developed COVID-19 symptoms. One surgeon developed COVID-19 infection before having performed any tracheostomies. The remaining eight members of the tracheostomy team were negative for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies 14 days after the study period.\nDiscussion\nThis is the largest single institution observational cohort study of patients undergoing tracheostomy with COVID-19. Using the selection criteria utilised by our institution, patients who underwent a tracheostomy were more likely to survive, compared with those that did not. This appeared to be independent of baseline prognosis, with no difference in APACHE II scores between the two groups. Survival was higher for patients with an APACHE score of &lt;17 compared with a score of &gt;=17. However, the survival advantage of those receiving a tracheostomy was seen in both groups, including in the sickest patients.\nDuring the study period, primary extubation was always the preferred option, usually occurring within 10 days of intubation. For those intubated for &gt;10 days, or those expected to have a slow respiratory wean by expert MDT consensus, a tracheostomy was felt to offer the advantage of safely weaning sedation, improving patient comfort, and allowing effective pulmonary toilet and proactive rehabilitation. Tracheostomy reduces airway trauma from prolonged tracheal intubation and perioral pressure sores exacerbated by prone-positioning that were observed in some of our patients. COVID-19-related laryngeal oedema, and upper airway oedema from prone-positioning also increased the risk of failure of extubation. These factors all guided a more interventionalist approach adopted by our COVID-19 airway team.\nIn the absence of an evidence base, many guidelines based on expert opinion were published referencing the role of tracheostomy in COVID-19. Early guidelines proposed avoiding a tracheostomy completely before 10 days of intubation and to only consider it carefully before performing at all between 10 and 21 days after intubation.   Indeed, a recent report of outcomes of patients from the USA shows only 17/203 (8%) received a tracheostomy. Later guidelines from an expert working group adopted a more moderate stance and the results of this study provide support for this approach.   Tracheostomy timing in COVID-19 patients should take into consideration the safety and ideal timing for patient outcomes, and the safety of healthcare personnel performing the tracheostomy.   \nThe timing of tracheostomy in patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation has been the subject of debate even before the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The landmark TracMan trial found no advantage of early (&lt;4 days) tracheostomy in relation to 30-day mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, or length of time in critical care. However, tracheostomy occurred in both trial arms much earlier after intubation than is recommended in the COVID-19 setting. Other studies have demonstrated a reduction in the duration of mechanical ventilation, and a reduction in critical care stay with early tracheostomy.     This also has implications for resource planning in a global pandemic, where ventilator capacity is a defining factor in hospitals not becoming overwhelmed. Our findings also suggest that tracheostomy at &lt;=14 days compared with tracheostomy at &gt;14 days, was associated with shorter periods of ventilation and ICU stay. In our cohort of 64 patients undergoing earlier tracheostomy, this equates to approximately 448 bed days gained over delaying until &gt;14 days as per the guidelines.\nThere was no difference in time from tracheostomy to either not requiring ventilatory support or being discharged from the ICU. This suggests the reductions were specifically as a result of shortening the period from intubation to tracheostomy. Hence, it appears safe and reasonable to perform a tracheostomy when clinically indicated and physiologically ready, and not wait for a defined time to pass. This may help to reduce the overall length of time required on mechanical ventilation and in the setting of a surge in SARS-CoV-2 patients, the ability to more efficiently move patients through the ICU allows hospitals to maximise their ventilator capacity.\nHealthcare personnel safety has influenced the development of tracheostomy guidelines. Some advocate delaying tracheostomy to allow time for the viral load to reduce, or after a negative SARS-CoV-2 swab result.       To lessen the potential viral exposure, guidelines have also stipulated a limit of two tracheostomies performed per day by the procedural team and on the number of days worked by any team member.   In our hospital, the core tracheostomy team were required to wear PPE, although this did not include the use of powered respirators or negative pressure rooms as advised in some current guidelines. At the peak of cases, more than 10 tracheostomies were being performed per day. All members of the team were head and neck cancer surgeons regularly performing open tracheostomies and were also trained to perform percutaneous tracheostomy without bronchoscopy to minimise aerosol generation. Among the tracheostomy team, none of the clinicians developed COVID-19 symptoms during the study period and subsequent antibody testing at 2 weeks after the study period was negative in all but one surgeon, who developed COVID-19 before commencing on the team. In addition, none of the SLT or ODP team members involved developed COVID-19 symptoms. In a review of 23 open tracheostomies performed during the 2003 SARS epidemic, no healthcare professionals contracted SARS with the use of appropriate PPE and care applied to minimise aerosol production. Our experience in a much larger cohort supports the assertion that tracheostomy can be performed with low risk to COVID-19 patients and healthcare workers. Indeed, delaying tracheostomy over concerns for healthcare personnel safety may prolong patients' time on a ventilator and ICU stay, without any benefit of improved safety for either the clinicians involved, or the patient.\nProlonged continuous sedation requirements are a recognised feature of ventilated COVID-19 patients. Tracheostomy provides an opportunity to reduce sedation requirements,   which allows patient participation in physiotherapy, earlier return to oral alimentation, reduced delirium, earlier identification of neurological dysfunction, and improved communication with staff and relatives. Lighter sedation is known to be a factor in reducing delirium in ICU patients and has been shown to reduce overall length of stay.   Early tracheostomy in our cohort was associated with rapid cessation of sedation in 77% of patients. This is likely to have impacted positively on the degree of delirium and may also have contributed to the reduced length of ICU stay seen in this group.\nOur approach to decannulation was developed by a multidisciplinary tracheostomy team led by SLT. Although guidelines suggest management of patients with cuffed non-fenestrated tubes, and awaiting negative SARS-CoV-2 swabs before deflating the cuff, we found this was not appropriate for the rehabilitative needs of this cohort. The need for downsizing and fenestration was required for decannulation in almost half of patients. The patients who required downsizing and fenestration of their tracheostomy tubes presented with symptoms of upper airway obstruction and oedema such as poor cough, ineffective voice, difficulty breathing around their tracheostomy tube, or the inability to tolerate a speaking valve.\nInterpretation of our results needs to consider several limitations. The inherent bias of any non-randomised study will affect the results, often in favour of the intervention being investigated. However, this is the first large cohort study with survival outcomes evaluating the role of tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients, indicating that current guidelines are too conservative. Despite the limitations, the findings suggest that the patient selection criteria implemented in our institution were able to successfully predict the patients who were likely to benefit from a tracheostomy. Furthermore, with the baseline APACHE II scores being the same for the two groups, it would imply not just a selection advantage, but the possibility that tracheostomy may confer benefit in patients with COVID-19.\nConclusions\nIn patients requiring mechanical ventilation for COVID-19-related pneumonitis, tracheostomy was associated with an improved 30-day survival. This benefit appeared to be independent of the severity of baseline illness, including the sickest patients. With appropriate patient selection, training of healthcare personnel, and allocation of resources, tracheostomies can be performed safely in patients with COVID-19. This may assist healthcare planning for future COVID-19 pandemic surges.\nAuthors' contributions\nWriting group, development of tracheostomy protocol, data collection and analysis, statistical analysis, delivery of tracheostomy service (Surgery): OB, PN, NS\nDevelopment of tracheostomy protocol, data collection, writing, review and editing of final manuscript, delivery of tracheostomy service (SLT): CD\nDevelopment of tracheostomy protocol, delivery of tracheostomy service (Surgery/ICU/Anaesthetics), review and editing of final manuscript: MI, CJ, TM, RM, DP, SP, PP, PrP, CR, SS, SS\nDelivery of tracheostomy service (ICU/Anaesthetics), review and editing of final manuscript: MB, PI, MM, NM, JP, RS, LT\nDevelopment and validation of antibody testing, review and editing of final manuscript: AR, AS\nAll authors have verified the accuracy and authenticity of the data.

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7121484","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical

SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and

All patients were confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the final date of follow-up was February 4, 2020.\nResults\nThe median age of 69 enrolled patients was 42.0 years (IQR 35.0-62.0), and 32 patients (46%) were men.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (60[87%]), cough (38[55%]), and fatigue (29[42%]).\n\n Most patients received antiviral therapy (66 [98.5%] of 67 patients) and antibiotic therapy (66 [98.5%] of 67 patients).\n\n As of February 4, 2020, 18 (26.9%) of 67 patients had been discharged, and five patients had died, with a mortality rate of 7.5%.\n\n According to the lowest SpO2 during admission, cases were divided into the SpO2?90% group (n=55) and the SpO2&lt;90% group (n=14).\n\n All 5 deaths occurred in the SpO2&lt;90% group.\n\n Compared with SpO2?90% group, patients of the SpO2&lt;90% group were older, and showed more comorbidities and higher plasma levels of IL6, IL10, lactate dehydrogenase, and c reactive protein.\n\n Arbidol treatment showed tendency to improve the discharging rate and decrease the mortality rate.\n\n\nConclusions\nCOVID-19 appears to show frequent fever, dry cough, and increase of inflammatory cytokines, and induced a mortality rate of 7.5%.\n\n Older patients or those with underlying comorbidities are at higher risk of death.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7184452","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Oxford University Press","authors":[{"firstname":"Zhongliang","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bohan","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qianwen","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lu","surname":"Wen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ruiguang","surname":"Zhang","email":"zrg27@163.com","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30566-3","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study","abstract":"Background\nSince December, 2019, Wuhan, China, has experienced an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).\n\n Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (?18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.\n\n\nFindings\n191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital.\n\n 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients).\n\n Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·03–1·17, per year increase;

aspects of the morbidity and mortality characterizing infection with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome-associated coronavirus-2, the etiologic agent of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n We examined skin and lung tissues from 5 patients with severe COVID-19 characterized by respiratory failure (n= 5) and purpuric skin rash (n?=?3).\n COVID-19 pneumonitis was predominantly a pauci-inflammatory septal capillary injury with significant septal capillary mural and luminal fibrin deposition and permeation of the interalveolar septa by neutrophils.\n No viral cytopathic changes were observed and the diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with hyaline membranes, inflammation, and type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, hallmarks of classic acute respiratory distress syndrome, were not prominent.\n These pulmonary findings were accompanied by significant deposits of terminal complement components C5b-9 (membrane attack complex), C4d, and mannose binding lectin (MBL)-associated serine protease (MASP)2, in the microvasculature, consistent with sustained, systemic activation of the complement pathways.\n The purpuric skin lesions similarly showed a pauci-inflammatory thrombogenic vasculopathy, with deposition of C5b-9 and C4d in both grossly involved and normally-appearing skin.\n In addition, there was co-localization of COVID-19 spike glycoproteins with C4d and C5b-9 in the interalveolar septa and the cutaneous microvasculature of 2 cases examined.\n In conclusion, at least a subset of sustained, severe COVID-19 may define a type of catastrophic microvascular injury syndrome mediated by activation of complement pathways and an associated procoagulant state.\n It provides a foundation for further exploration of the pathophysiologic importance of complement in COVID-19, and could suggest targets for specific intervention.\n","id":"PMC7158248","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020.

novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39),

enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients

outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), consistent and considerable differences in disease severity and mortality rate of patients treated in Hubei province compared to those in other parts of China have been observed.\n\n We sought to compare the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients being treated inside and outside Hubei province, and explore the factors underlying these differences.\n\n\nMethods\nCollaborating with the National Health Commission, we established a retrospective cohort to study hospitalised COVID-19 cases in China.\n\n Clinical characteristics, the rate of severe events and deaths, and the time to critical illness (invasive ventilation or intensive care unit admission or death) were compared between patients within and outside Hubei.\n\n The impact of Wuhan-related exposure (a presumed key factor that drove the severe situation in Hubei, as Wuhan is the epicentre as well the administrative centre of Hubei province) and the duration between symptom onset and admission on prognosis were also determined.\n\n\nResults\nAt the data cut-off (31 January 2020), 1590 cases from 575 hospitals in 31 provincial administrative regions were collected (core cohort).\n\n The overall rate of severe cases and mortality was 16.0% and 3.2%, respectively.\n\n Patients in Hubei (predominantly with Wuhan-related exposure, 597 (92.3%) out of 647) were older (mean age 49.7 versus 44.9?years), had more cases with comorbidity (32.9% versus 19.7%), higher symptomatic burden, abnormal radiologic manifestations and, especially, a longer waiting time between symptom onset and admission (5.7 versus 4.5?days) compared with patients outside Hubei.\n\n Patients in Hubei (severe event rate 23.0% versus 11.1%, death rate 7.3% versus 0.3%, HR (95% CI) for critical illness 1.59 (1.05–2.41)) have a poorer prognosis compared with patients outside Hubei after adjusting for age and comorbidity.\n\n However, among patients outside Hubei, the duration from symptom onset to hospitalisation (mean 4.4 versus 4.7?days) and prognosis (HR (95%) 0.84 (0.40–1.80)) were similar between patients with or without Wuhan-related exposure.\n\n In the overall population, the waiting time, but neither treated in Hubei nor Wuhan-related exposure, remained an independent prognostic factor (HR (95%) 1.05 (1.01–1.08)).\n\n\nConclusion\nThere were more severe cases and poorer outcomes for COVID-19 patients treated in Hubei, which might be attributed to the prolonged duration of symptom onset to hospitalisation in the epicentre.\n\n Future studies to determine the reason for delaying hospitalisation are warranted.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7144336","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"European Respiratory

meta-analysis","abstract":"Introduction\nThe aim of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis to determine whether percutaneous tracheostomy (PT) techniques are advantageous over surgical tracheostomy (ST), and if one PT technique is superior to the others.\n\n\nMethods\nComputerized databases (1966 to 2013) were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting complications as predefined endpoints and comparing PT and ST and among the different PT techniques in mechanically ventilated adult critically ill patients.\n\n Odds ratios (OR) and mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI), and I2 values were estimated.\n\n\nResults\nFourteen RCTs tested PT techniques versus ST in 973 patients.\n\n PT techniques were performed faster (MD, ?13.06 minutes (95% CI, ?19.37 to ?6.76 (P &lt;0.0001)); I2?=?97% (P &lt;0.00001)) and reduced odds for stoma inflammation (OR, 0.38 (95% CI, 0.19 to 0.76 (P?=?0.006)); I2?=?2% (P?=?0.36)), and infection (OR, 0.22 (95% CI, 0.11 to 0.41 (P &lt;0.00001)); I2?=?0% (P?=?0.54)), but increased odds for procedural technical difficulties (OR, 4.58 (95% CI, 2.21 to 9.47 (P &lt;0.0001)); I2?=?0% (P?=?0.63)).\n\n PT techniques reduced odds for postprocedural major bleeding (OR, 0.39 (95% CI, 0.15 to 0.97 (P?=?0.04)); I2?=?0% (P?=?0.69)), but not when a single RCT using translaryngeal tracheostomy was excluded (OR, 0.58 (95% CI, 0.21 to 1.63 (P?=?0.30)); I2?=?0% (P?=?0.89)).\n\n Eight RCTs compared different PT techniques in 700 patients.\n\n Multiple (MDT) and single step (SSDT) dilatator techniques are associated with the lowest odds for difficult dilatation or cannula insertion (OR, 0.30 (95% CI, 0.12 to 0.80 (P?=?0.02)); I2?=?56% (P?=?0.03)) and major intraprocedural bleeding (OR, 0.29 (95% CI, 0.10 to 0.85 (P?=?0.02)); I2?=?0% (P?=?0.72)), compared to the guide wire dilatation forceps technique.\n\n\nConclusion\nIn critically ill adult patients, PT techniques can be performed faster and reduce stoma inflammation and infection but are associated with increased technical difficulties when compared to ST.\n\n Among PT techniques, MDT and SSDT were associated with the lowest intraprocedural risks and seem to be preferable.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13054-014-0544-7) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized

In particular, concerns and precautions have increased regarding the use of aerosol-generating medical procedures when treating patients with such viral infections.\n In spite of increasing associations between aerosol-generating medical procedures and the nosocomial transmission of viruses, we still have a poor understanding of the risks of specific procedures and viruses.\n In order to identify which aerosol-generating medical procedures and emerging viruses pose a high risk to health-care workers, we explore the mechanisms of aerosol-generating medical procedures, as well as the

otolaryngology procedures and the need for enhanced PPE during the COVID-19 pandemic: a literature review","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>Adequate personal protective equipment is needed to reduce the rate of transmission of COVID-19 to health care workers.\n\n Otolaryngology groups are recommending a higher level of personal protective equipment for aerosol-generating procedures than public health agencies.\n\n The objective of the review was to provide evidence that a.\n\n) demonstrates which otolaryngology procedures are aerosol-generating, and that b.\n\n) clarifies whether the higher level of PPE advocated by otolaryngology groups is justified.\n\n\nMain body\nid='Par2'>Health care workers in China who performed tracheotomy during the SARS-CoV-1 epidemic had 4.15 times greater odds of contracting the virus than controls who did not perform tracheotomy (95% CI 2.75–7.54).\n\n No other studies provide direct epidemiological evidence of increased aerosolized transmission of viruses during otolaryngology procedures.\n\n Experimental evidence has shown that electrocautery, advanced energy devices, open suctioning, and drilling can create aerosolized biological particles.\n\n The viral load of COVID-19 is highest in the upper aerodigestive tract, increasing the likelihood that aerosols generated during procedures of the upper aerodigestive tract of infected patients would carry viral material.\n\n Cough and normal breathing create aerosols which may increase the risk of transmission during outpatient procedures.\n\n A significant proportion of individuals infected with COVID-19 may not have symptoms, raising the likelihood of transmission of the disease to inadequately protected health care workers from patients who do not have probable or confirmed infection.\n\n Powered air purifying respirators, if used properly, provide a greater level of filtration than N95 masks and thus may reduce the risk of transmission.\n\n\nConclusion\nid='Par3'>Direct and indirect evidence suggests that a large number of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery procedures are aerosol generating.\n\n Otolaryngologists are likely at high risk of contracting COVID-19 during aerosol generating procedures because they are likely exposed to high viral loads in patients infected with the virus.\n\n Based on the precautionary principle, even though the evidence is not definitive, adopting enhanced personal protective equipment protocols is reasonable based on the evidence.\n\n Further research is needed to clarify the risk associated with performing various procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the degree to which various personal protective equipment reduces the

tools to reduce SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammatory responses include various methods to block FcR activation.\n In the absence of a proven clinical FcR blocker, the use of intravenous immunoglobulin to block FcR activation may be a viable option for the urgent treatment of pulmonary inflammation to prevent severe lung injury.\n Such treatment may also be combined with systemic anti-inflammatory

In addition, nosocomial infection of hospitalized patients and healthcare workers, and viral transmission from asymptomatic carriers are possible.\n The most common finding on chest imaging among patients with pneumonia was ground-glass opacity with bilateral involvement.\n Severe cases are more likely to be older patients with underlying comorbidities compared to mild cases.\n Indeed, age and disease severity may be correlated with the outcomes of COVID-19. To date, effective treatment is lacking; however, clinical trials investigating the efficacy of several agents, including remdesivir and chloroquine, are underway in China.\n Currently, effective infection control intervention is the only way to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2.","id":"PMC7128959","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Taiwan Society of Microbiology.

transcription PCR (RT-PCR) method has limitations for clinical diagnosis and treatment.\n\n\nMethods\nA total of 323 samples from 76 COVID-19 confirmed patients were analyzed by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) and RT-PCR based two target genes (ORF1ab and N).\n\n Nasal swabs, throat swabs, sputum, blood, and urine were collected.\n\n Clinical and imaging data were obtained for clinical staging.\n\n\nResults\nIn 95 samples tested positive by both methods, the cycle threshold (Ct) of RT-PCR was highly correlated with the copy numbed of ddPCR (ORF1ab gene, R2 = 0.83; N gene, R2 = 0.87).\n\n 4 (4/161) negative and 41 (41/67) single-gene positive samples tested by RT-PCR were positive according to ddPCR with viral load ranging from 11.1 to 123.2 copies/test.\n\n Then the viral load of respiratory samples was compared and the average viral load in sputum (17429 ± 6920 copies/test) was found to be significantly higher than in throat swabs (2552 ± 1965 copies/test, p &lt; 0.001) and nasal swabs (651 ± 501 copies/test, p &lt; 0.001).\n\n Furthermore, the viral load in the early and progressive stages were significantly higher than that in the recovery stage (46800 ± 17272 vs 1252 ± 1027, p &lt; 0.001) analyzed by sputum samples.\n\n\nConclusions\nQuantitative monitoring of viral load in lower respiratory tract samples helps to evaluate disease progression,

care workers’ skin and clothing during removal of personal protective equipment","abstract":"Background\nThe removal of personal protective equipment (PPE) after patient care may result in transfer of virus to hands and clothing of health care workers (HCWs).\n\n The risk of transfer can be modeled using harmless viruses to obtain quantitative data.\n\n To determine whether double-gloving reduces virus transfer to HCWs’ hands and clothing during removal of contaminated PPE, we conducted a human challenge study using bacteriophages to compare the frequency and quantity of virus transfer to hands and clothes during PPE removal with single-gloving and double-gloving technique.\n\n\nMethods\nEach experiment had a double-gloving phase and a single-gloving phase.\n\n Participants donned PPE (ie, contact isolation gown, N95 respirator, eye protection, latex gloves).\n\n The gown, respirator, eye protection, and dominant glove were contaminated with bacteriophage.\n\n Participants then removed the PPE, and their hands, face, and scrubs were sampled for virus.\n\n\nResults\nTransfer of virus to hands during PPE removal was significantly more frequent with single-gloving than with double-gloving.\n\n Transfer to scrubs was similar during single-gloving and double-gloving.\n\n The amount of virus transfer to hands ranged from 0.15 to 2.5 log10 most probable number.\n\n Significantly more virus was transferred to participants’ hands after single-gloving than after double-gloving.\n\n\nConclusions\nOur comparison of double-gloving and single-gloving using a simulation system with MS2 and a most-probable number method suggests that double gloving can reduce the risk of viral contamination of HCWs’ hands during PPE removal.\n\n If incorporated into practice when full

SARS-CoV-2 in patients of novel coronavirus disease 2019","abstract":"Background\nThe novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is a newly emerging virus.\n\n The antibody response in infected patient remains largely unknown, and the clinical values of antibody testing have not been fully demonstrated.\n\n\nMethods\nA total of 173 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled.\n\n Their serial plasma samples (n=535) collected during the hospitalization were tested for total antibodies (Ab), IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2. The dynamics of antibodies with the disease progress was analyzed.\n\n\nResults\nAmong 173 patients, the seroconversion rate for Ab, IgM and IgG was 93.1%, 82.7% and 64.7%, respectively.\n\n The reason for the negative antibody findings in 12 patients might due to the lack of blood samples at the later stage of illness.\n\n The median seroconversion time for Ab, IgM and then IgG were day-11, day-12 and day-14, separately.\n\n The presence of antibodies was &lt;40% among patients within 1-week since onset, and rapidly increased to 100.0% (Ab), 94.3% (IgM) and 79.8% (IgG) since day-15 after onset.\n\n In contrast, RNA detectability decreased from 66.7% (58/87) in samples collected before day-7 to 45.5% (25/55) during day 15-39. Combining RNA and antibody detections significantly improved the sensitivity of pathogenic diagnosis for COVID-19 (p&lt;0.001), even in early phase of 1-week since onset (p=0.007).\n\n Moreover, a higher titer of Ab was independently associated with a worse clinical classification (p=0.006).\n\n\nConclusions\nThe antibody detection offers vital clinical information during the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n The findings provide strong empirical support for the routine application of serological testing in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7184337","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Oxford University

characterisation and epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and

course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

Primary articles were identified by English-language Pubmed/MEDLINE, Cochrane central register of controlled trials, and Cochrane systemic review database search (1960–June 2009) using the MeSH headings: ARDS, adult respiratory distress syndrome, ARDS, corticosteroids, and methylprednisolone (MP).\n The identified studies were reviewed and information regarding role of corticosteroids in prevention and treatment of ARDS was evaluated.\n Nine trials have evaluated the role of corticosteroid drugs in management of ARDS at various stages.\n Of the 9, 4 trials evaluated role of corticosteroids in prevention of ARDS, while other 5 trials were focused on treatment after variable periods of onset of ARDS.\n Trials with preventive corticosteroids, mostly using high doses of MP, showed negative results with patients in treatment arm, showing higher mortality and rate of ARDS development.\n While trials of corticosteroids in early ARDS showed variable results, somewhat, favoring use of these agents to reduce associated morbidities.\n In late stage of ARDS, these drugs have no benefits and are associated with adverse outcome.\n Use of corticosteroids in patients with early ARDS showed equivocal results in decreasing mortality; however, there is evidence that these drugs reduce organ dysfunction score, lung injury score, ventilator requirement, and intensive care unit stay.\n However, most of these trials are small, having a significant heterogeneity regarding study design, etiology of ARDS, and dosage of corticosteroids.\n Further research involving large-scale trials on relatively homogeneous cohort is necessary to establish the role of corticosteroids for this condition.\n","id":"PMC3109833","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Medknow

management in acute lung injury and ards","abstract":"ARDS is particularly characterized by pulmonary edema caused by an increase in pulmonary capillary permeability.\n It is considered that limiting pulmonary edema or accelerating its resorption through the modulation of fluid intake or oncotic pressure could be beneficial.\n This review discusses the principal clinical studies that have made it possible to progress in the optimization of the fluid state during ARDS.\n Notably, a randomized, multicenter study has suggested that fluid management with the goal to obtain zero fluid balance in ARDS patients without shock or renal failure significantly increases the number of days without mechanical ventilation.\n On the other hand, it is accepted that patients with hemodynamic failure must undergo early and adapted vascular filling.\n Liberal and conservative filling strategies are therefore complementary and should ideally follow each other in time in the same patient whose hemodynamic state progressively stabilizes.\n At present, although albumin treatment has been suggested to improve oxygenation transiently in ARDS patients, no sufficient evidence justifies its use to mitigate pulmonary edema and reduce respiratory morbidity.\n Finally, the resorption of alveolar edema occurs through an active mechanism, which can be pharmacologically upregluated.\n In this sense, the use of beta-2 agonists may be beneficial but further studies are needed to confirm preliminary promising
