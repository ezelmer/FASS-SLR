Tweets including #PedsICU were shared 49,865 times on six continents between February 1, 2020, and May 1, 2020; between February 1 and March 13, only 8% of #PedsICU tweets included a coronavirus disease 2019 hashtag. After a sharp rise during the week of March 14, 2020, coronavirus disease 2019 content has dominated the #PedsICU conversation on Twitter, comprising 69% of both #PedsICU tweets and impressions (p &lt; 0.001). The most commonly used coronavirus disease 2019 hashtag over the study period was #COVID19 (69%). Proportionately, a greater percentage of #PedsICU tweets including the coronavirus disease 2019 hashtag (vs not) had images or videos (45% vs 41%; p &lt; 0.001). In addition, non-physician healthcare providers were the largest group of users (46%) of the combination of #PedsICU and coronavirus disease 2019 hashtags. The most popular tweets shared on Twitter were open-access resources, including links for updated literature, narrative reviews, and educational videos relevant to coronavirus disease 2019 clinical care. Concurrent hashtags and words in tweets containing #PedsICU and coronavirus disease 2019 hashtags spanned several different disciplines and topics in pediatric critical care.\nConclusion:\nTwitter has been used widely for real-time information sharing and collaboration among the international pediatric critical care community during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Targeted use of #PedsICU and #COVID19 for engagement on Twitter is a conduit to combat misinformation and optimize reach to pediatric critical care stakeholders across the globe when rapid dissemination is needed.\nNever has there been a more important need for rapid information dissemination in the 21st century than during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. At the time of this writing in early May 2020, COVID-19 infections have surpassed 3.8 million people globally, with over 260,000 deaths. Since its origin as an epidemic in China in December 2019, information guiding critical care practice has been growing and changing each day, with anecdotal and case series data providing the foundation of therapeutic guidance for clinicians fighting the disease worldwide. In response, journals have made rapid peer review and publication of COVID-19 literature a high priority. However, for clinicians trying to establish best clinical practice, keeping up with that literature and the wealth of information from critical care colleagues across the globe, while balancing high acuity and clinical responsibilities, can be overwhelming. In any emergency mass critical care event, as in COVID-19, a comprehensive approach to education is needed to ensure preparedness.\nThe international pediatric critical care community is dealing with multiple unique challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although emerging evidence has shown that children are at risk for critical illness from COVID-19 infection, severe disease has primarily affected adults. Because of disproportionately increased resource needs in adult ICUs, many staff from PICUs have been deployed to care for adult COVID-19 patients. In fact, several PICUs have already transitioned to being ICUs for adults to meet the needs of adult COVID-19 ICU care. Yet, recent models of pediatric COVID-19 disease in the United States, for example, project that thousands of children may require hospitalization and potentially critical care management as disease burden peaks across the nation. Most recently, reports of a hyperinflammatory syndrome with multiple organ failure in previously asymptomatic children with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are emerging in the United Kingdom and across the world. Thus, the global PICU community is in need of not only real-time networking and information dissemination regarding COVID-19 disease manifestations in children, but also education and collaboration in the process of caring for adult ICU patients.\nSocial media is a real-time and instant communication platform that is used in healthcare for information dissemination and acquisition, professional networking, and patient advocacy. Through the use of hashtags, the equivalent of a keyword, social media enables the curation of content relevant to a specific area or focus. In 2016, the hashtag #PedsICU was established to cohort pediatric critical care content on the popular social media platform Twitter. Over the last 3 years, global engagement with #PedsICU has burgeoned across disciplines and PICU training programs, with over 5,000 tweets containing #PedsICU shared during the 2020 Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) Annual Congress alone. In fact, #PedsICU was the most common concurrently used hashtag with the Congress hashtag (#CCC49). Thus, social media could act as a major conduit within the pediatric critical care community for sharing pandemic-related information and experiences in real time. The objective of this report is to describe the use and impact of a targeted strategy for international collaboration and rapid information dissemination on Twitter among members of the pediatric critical care community during a global pandemic.\nMETHODS\nTargeted Information-Sharing Strategy\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. On March 15, 2020, the authors began promoting the use of #PedsICU in combination with #COVID19 on Twitter for all tweets relevant to both pediatric critical care and COVID-19. We also created a web link to relevant tweets to provide streamlined universal access for anyone with or without a Twitter account (bit.ly/pedsicucovid).The social media strategy and weblink were disseminated via Twitter and through communication with leaders in the pediatric critical care field, including the International PICU COVID-19 Collaboration.\nData Collection and Analysis\nWe used Symplur Signals (Symplur, LLC, Upland, CA), a social media analytics tool for healthcare, to track all tweets that included the #PedsICU hashtag between February 1, 2020, and May 1, 2020. After extracting all tweets containing #PedsICU during the study period, we manually reviewed them for inclusion of at least one COVID-19-related hashtag and aggregated those tweets. These COVID-19-related hashtags included #COVID19, #coronavirus, #COVID:19, #Covid_19, #COVID2019, #COVID, #covid4MDs, #COVIDfoam, #SARSCoV2, #Coronavid19, #2019nCoV, #CoronavirusOutbreak, #COVID19pandemic, #COVID19mx, #CoronavirusPandemic, #sarscovid2, and #SARS_COV_2 (Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/PCC/B388).\nData collected included the number of tweets, users, and impressions (i.e., potential views) during the study period. Characteristics of the users tweeting (healthcare provider, researcher, organization, non-healthcare/public) and the tweet characteristics (retweets, media, links, replies) were also analyzed. We then performed a social media network analysis to characterize the relationships between specific Twitter users engaging with both #PedsICU and COVID-19 content. In addition, we collected information about the most popular tweets and most commonly used hashtags, words, and links in tweets containing both #PedsICU and at least one COVID-19 hashtag.\nWe calculated both descriptive and comparative statistics. Categorical data are reported as relative frequencies (%) and analyzed by chi-square test. A two-tailed p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Stata 14 (StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX) was used for all statistical analysis. This study was reviewed by the Connecticut Children's Institutional Review Board and considered exempt.\nRESULTS\nCharacteristics of #PedsICU Tweets With and Without COVID-19 Content\nDuring the entire period of study, 49,865 tweets sent by 21,871 cumulative users contained the #PedsICU hashtag. Of all #PedsICU tweets, 43% (21,538) also included a COVID-19 hashtag (Table 1). Among #PedsICU tweets with a COVID-19 hashtag, #COVID19 was the most commonly included (69%). #PedsICU tweets with concurrent use of a COVID-19 hashtag had more mentions of another Twitter account (92% vs 84%; p &lt; 0.001) and a higher relative proportion (45% vs 41%; p &lt; 0.001) of visual media usage, that is, pictures or GIFs. Most of the digital footprint comprised retweets (84%). Healthcare providers were the largest stakeholder group tweeting all #PedsICU content (72%; Table 1), and non-physician healthcare providers contributed the highest engagement in COVID-19 tweets (46%; p &lt; 0.001). Figure 1 displays a network analysis that illustrates the spectrum of individual and organizational stakeholders, including usernames, that influenced #PedsICU tweets with COVID-19 hashtags. As shown in Figure 2, the geographic distribution for users tweeting with both #PedsICU and a COVID-19-related hashtag spanned six continents, with most tweets from North America and Australia.\nCharacteristics of #PedsICU Tweets With and Without Coronavirus Disease 2019 Hashtags (February 1, 2020, to May 2, 2020)\nNetwork analysis of users tweeting with both #PedsICU and a coronavirus disease 2019-related hashtag. The size and density of a node proportionally reflect the average amount of time a participant/user spends in conversation, and the arrows reflect the conversational connections between nodes.\nGeographic distribution of participants tweeting with both #PedsICU and a coronavirus disease 2019 hashtag.\nTemporal Trends in Usage of #PedsICU and COVID-19 Hashtags\nAs shown in Figure 3, we examined trends in Twitter usage of #PedsICU in addition to tweets containing both #PedsICU and a COVID-19 hashtag. There was a large increase in usage of the #PedsICU hashtag during the annual SCCM Congress (#CCC49) held February 15-19, 2020. During the week of Congress, 5,202 tweets were shared including #PedsICU and involved 1,245 unique users. However, only 35 tweets contained a COVID-19 hashtag during that period. Between February 1, 2020, and March 13, 2020, only 8% of all #PedsICU tweets included a COVID-19 hashtag. Concurrent use of a COVID-19 hashtag with #PedsICU gradually increased from late February to early March 2020. From the week of March 7-13 to the week of March 14-20, the use of COVID-19 hashtags in tweets with #PedsICU tripled from 1,345 to 4,238 as did the number of unique users (Fig. 3). After this initial peak, COVID-19 hashtags have continued to dominate the #PedsICU conversation on Twitter, comprising 69% of both tweets and impressions, since March 14, 2020.\nTweets (A), impressions (B), and users (C) per week for #PedsICU and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) hashtags (February 1, 2020, to May 1, 2020). NHS = National Health Service, SCCM = Society of Critical Care Medicine, WHO = World Health Organization.\nConcurrent Hashtags and Words in #PedsICU Tweets\nDuring the study period, #COVID19 was the hashtag most commonly used concurrently with #PedsICU, as illustrated by the word cloud in Supplemental Digital Content 2 (http://links.lww.com/PCC/B388). Other hashtags and words commonly used in conjunction with both #PedsICU and COVID-19 hashtags during the study period (Fig. 4) encompassed a number of relevant clinical and advocacy themes (e.g., #IDtwitter, #PedsAnes, #PPE) and well-established hashtags (#ICU, #medtwitter, #FOAMped). Similarly, the most common words focused on terms relevant to pediatrics.\nMost common other hashtags and words included in tweets with #PedsICU and coronavirus disease 2019 hashtags.\nMost Popular Tweets and Links With #PedsICU and COVID-19 Hashtags\nThe 10 most popular tweets including #PedsICU and a COVID-19 hashtag during the study period were examined as well as top 10 tweets with weblinks. The most popular tweets (Supplemental Digital Content 3, http://links.lww.com/PCC/B388) were shared anywhere from 121 to 3,250 times, with the top tweet garnering approximately 7 million impressions (Fig. 5). All of the most highly shared tweets and links were from individual pediatric critical care stakeholders or established medical organizations and made available as open-access resources. Four of the most commonly shared links (Table 2) were collections of resources, two were narrative reviews, and four of the 10 were from the United Kingdom or Europe.\nTop 10 Links Shared With #PedsICU and a Coronavirus Disease 2019 Hashtag (February 1, 2020, to May 1, 2020)\nTweet with highest engagement during the study period illustrating use of #PedsICU and coronavirus disease 2019 hashtags.\nDISCUSSION\nTwitter has served as a robust source of information sharing and dissemination for the international pediatric critical care community during the COVID-19 pandemic, with over 12,000 unique participants and over 21,000 #PedsICU tweets containing COVID-19 hashtags since February 2020. These tweets have resulted in over 44 million potential views on Twitter. The promotion of #PedsICU with #COVID19 as an information-sharing strategy on Twitter immediately after the WHO declared COVID-19 a global pandemic was associated with markedly increased engagement by pediatric critical care stakeholders worldwide through the consistent use of common hashtags. As evidenced by the growth in unique participants, our study highlights the influence of social media on rapid dissemination of information as well as strategies for deploying reliable information from trusted sources to a wide spectrum of PICU stakeholders.\nWith regard to information sharing, social media is the great equalizer. Across community and academic hospitals and all resource levels, social media provides an instant conduit to educational information from across the globe. As COVID-19 evolved and spread across continents, international and national stakeholder organizations (e.g., @WHO, @CDCgov), news outlets, and individuals began using social media to share information broadly. Clinicians began sharing their perspectives and experiences with treating COVID-19 in countries most stricken by the disease, including Italy, Spain, and the United States. Although much of this content is relevant to the #PedsICU community, having a direct connection to the most relevant and timely content is ideal. The wide variability of hashtags often used for the same topic makes searching for content on Twitter difficult (Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/PCC/B388). Therefore, the introduction and wide dissemination of #COVID19 for concurrent use with #PedsICU established a conduit for all PICU stakeholders to share and access relevant information easily, which is reflected by the number of unique users tripling the week of March 14 when the WHO declared a global pandemic.\nThe increase in new unique users engaged in #PedsICU COVID-19 tweets since March 14 highlights an important difference between social media use during conferences, that is, &quot;live-tweeting the meeting,&quot; and information dissemination during a pandemic. Although the SCCM Congress was a peak time in #PedsICU engagement as demonstrated by tweets and impressions, it was the result of a smaller group of highly engaged users including the SCCM Social Media Committee and Congress attendees. In contrast, #PedsICU tweets during the COVID-19 pandemic included 2-4x the number of unique users during peak weeks compared with SCCM congress, suggesting that information is reaching and engaging a much larger audience.\nA major benefit of social media for information sharing is instantaneous access to the most recent literature available. As journals have prioritized rapid review and open-access publication of COVID-19-specific studies, keeping up with the latest literature has become even more overwhelming than before. A pediatric critical care-specific information-sharing strategy provides social media users with real-time access to the literature with highest relevance to their practice. As #PedsICU influencers share these studies with their followers, a virtual library is created that updates automatically and is accessible to all. COVID-19 tweets were more likely to include media and links than other #PedsICU tweets, suggesting that sharing clinical updates and literature in real time plays an important role in the conversation. As an example, the tweet with highest engagement during the study period was an urgent alert from the Pediatric Intensive Care Society (@PICSociety) in the United Kingdom with an image announcing an observed rise in SARS-CoV-2-related inflammatory syndromes, which was shared over 3,500 times (Fig. 5). Given its public health importance, the tweet was shared broadly by international news outlets and prominent media figures, expanding the reach of this important information far beyond the critical care community and increasing public awareness and advocacy.\nAlthough physicians comprised almost one third of users engaged in #PedsICU and COVID-19 content, robust engagement was also observed from interprofessional PICU team members, including nurses, nurse practitioners, respiratory therapists, pharmacists, physical and occupational therapists, and speech-language pathologists. The use of established hashtags for each of these communities (e.g., #nursetwitter, #NPslead, #respiratory, #PharmICU, #icurehab) provides an additional conduit to share discipline-specific information within specialties. This interdisciplinary conversation is critically important given the severity and burden of COVID-19 disease and the importance of collaboration between disciplines to provide optimal care both inside and outside the ICU.\nAlthough social media is an outstanding method for disseminating information, collaborating, and networking, a pandemic also spotlights potential sources of misinformation. A March 2020 study that investigated misinformation on Twitter surrounding the then-Coronavirus epidemic found that 25% of tweets contained misinformation and that 17% had unverifiable information, mostly from individual users. As a smaller medical community, pediatric critical care medicine may potentially benefit from a lower risk of misinformation. However, critical evaluation of social media content is always recommended. Social media users can curate their content by carefully considering the individuals and organizations that they follow and engage with. Thus, our network analysis (Fig. 1) provides a broad range of individual and organizational stakeholders with consistent engagement in #PedsICU and COVID-19-related topics for new social media users to consider following. This group represents PICU stakeholders across six continents and, in addition to individual interprofessional clinicians, includes large organizations (@SCCM, @WFPICCS, @OpenPediatrics, @ESPNIC_Society), journals (@PedCritCareMed, @CritCareExplore), and research networks (@paccman_asia, @LARednetwork). More recently, the Pediatric Overflow Planning Contingency Network (@POPCoRNetwork) has provided pediatricians, including PICU clinicians, streamlined access to networking and educational resources to facilitate care of adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. These individuals and groups likely represent sources of reliable and verifiable information in a time when the spread of misinformation is a critically important consideration. Although the risk of misinformation cannot be fully abolished, the concurrent hashtags and words used with #PedsICU and COVID-19 tweets, as well as top tweets, suggest that the quality of information is high and not contaminated by clinically irrelevant content.\nWe encourage all pediatric critical care stakeholders to consider engaging in social media for professional development, and there are several free resources available for novices seeking a primer including a #PedsICU-specific &quot;how-to&quot; guide (https://bit.ly/pedsicusocialmedia). In fact, it is the responsibility of healthcare organizations to ensure their staff have the most current information and access to just-in-time training resources during a mass critical care event. However, it is important to note that a proportion of PICU stakeholders may never use social media professionally or create their own Twitter account. An advantage of Twitter is that all content is publicly available. Thus, the establishment of a weblink to all #PedsICU #COVID19 tweets (bit.ly/pedsicucovid)provides all stakeholders access to this content if they choose at any interval. Additionally, this weblink creates a living transcript of all tweets for reference in the future.\nOur study is limited by its descriptive nature and inability to draw causal association between the social media strategy and increased engagement described. It is possible that engagement with #PedsICU and #COVID19 was largely due to a general increase in interest and focus on the pandemic during a critical time period. Additionally, we are unable to further characterize users owing to variability in what is available from the public Twitter profile. Also, we did not include tweets containing only words (without hashtags) related to COVID-19 and therefore may have underestimated the number of tweets relevant to pediatric critical care. Finally, another important note and limitation is that Twitter is not available as a social media platform in China. Thus, Chinese social media communication (i.e., WeChat, Sina Weibo) is not reflected in our data and may have been a barrier to early global information dissemination and communication with pediatric critical care colleagues who first encountered COVID-19 disease.\nSUMMARY\nThe observed trends in concurrent #PedsICU and #COVID19 usage reflect evolving information, knowledge gained, and collaborations among the global pediatric critical care community. With emerging pediatric COVID-19 data showing increased burden for pediatric critical care in the coming weeks and months, having an established strategy for content curation provides all PICU stakeholders with easy access to the same information in real time regardless of resources or distance. As each PICU and hospital tackles the challenges and needs of their patient population during this pandemic, the collective experience of our colleagues across the globe can and should be leveraged in real time through the power of social media. Thus, it is imperative moving forward that our pediatric critical care leaders familiarize themselves with social media as an essential resource to ensure that we have reliable content expertise and international representation. As the digital footprint of the pediatric critical care community grows, social media is a central component of the educational armamentarium for interprofessional staff caring for critically ill patients worldwide both during and beyond a pandemic.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank Claire Levine, MS, in the Johns Hopkins Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine for her editorial assistance with this article.\nSupplementary Material\nSupplemental digital content is available for this article.

Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data.\n\n Outcomes were followed up until Jan 25, 2020.\nFindings\nOf the 99 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, 49 (49%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market.\n\n The average age of the patients was 55·5 years (SD 13·1), including 67 men and 32 women.\n\n 2019-nCoV was detected in all patients by real-time RT-PCR.\n\n 50 (51%) patients had chronic diseases.\n\n Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (82 [83%] patients), cough (81 [82%] patients), shortness of breath (31 [31%] patients), muscle ache (11 [11%] patients), confusion (nine [9%] patients), headache (eight [8%] patients), sore throat (five [5%] patients), rhinorrhoea (four [4%] patients), chest pain (two [2%] patients), diarrhoea (two [2%] patients), and nausea and vomiting (one [1%] patient).\n\n According to imaging examination, 74 (75%) patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 14 (14%) patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity, and one (1%) patient had pneumothorax.\n\n 17 (17%) patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and, among them, 11 (11%) patients worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection was of clustering onset, is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n In general, characteristics of patients who died were in line with the MuLBSTA score, an early warning model for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia.\n\n Further investigation is needed to explore the applicability of the MuLBSTA score in predicting the risk of mortality in 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key R&amp;D Program of China.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7135076","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Nanshan","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Min","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuan","surname":"Dong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jieming","surname":"Qu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fengyun","surname":"Gong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Han","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Qiu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jingli","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jia'an","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xinxin","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Li","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Available from: https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports-48.Accessed March 29, 2020","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Epidemiological characteristics of 2143 pediatric patients with 2019 coronavirus disease in China","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Indian Council of Medical Research.

coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing Municipal Science and Technology

available.\n\n\nResults\nWe report, however, that chloroquine has strong antiviral effects on SARS-CoV infection of primate cells.\n\n These inhibitory effects are observed when the cells are treated with the drug either before or after exposure to the virus, suggesting both prophylactic and therapeutic advantage.\n\n In addition to the well-known functions of chloroquine such as elevations of endosomal pH, the drug appears to interfere with terminal glycosylation of the cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. This may negatively influence the virus-receptor binding and abrogate the infection, with further ramifications by the elevation of vesicular pH, resulting in the inhibition of infection and spread of SARS CoV at clinically admissible concentrations.\n\n\nConclusion\nChloroquine is effective in preventing the spread of SARS CoV in cell culture.\n\n Favorable inhibition of virus spread was observed when the cells were either treated with chloroquine prior to or after SARS CoV infection.\n\n In addition, the indirect immunofluorescence assay described herein represents a simple and rapid method for screening SARS-CoV antiviral compounds.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1232869","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Martin J","surname":"Vincent","email":"mvincent@cdc.gov","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Eric","surname":"Bergeron","email":"bergere@ircm.qc.ca","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Suzanne","surname":"Benjannet","email":"benjans@ircm.qc.ca","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Bobbie R","surname":"Erickson","email":"BErickson1@cdc.gov","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pierre E","surname":"Rollin","email":"PRollin@cdc.gov","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Thomas G","surname":"Ksiazek","email":"TKsiazek@cdc.gov","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nabil G","surname":"Seidah","email":"seidahn@ircm.qc.ca","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Stuart T","surname":"Nichol","email":"SNichol@cdc.gov","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin as a treatment of COVID 19: Results of an open label non randomized clinical trial","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Global virus outbreaks: interferons as 1st responders","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1002/jmv.25707","date":"2020-02-04","title":"Potential interventions for novel coronavirus in China: A systematic review","abstract":"An outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID?19 or 2019?CoV) infection has posed significant threats to international health and the economy.\n In the absence of treatment for this virus, there is an urgent need to find alternative methods to control the spread of disease.\n Here, we have conducted an online search for all treatment options related to coronavirus infections as well as some RNA?virus infection and we have found that general treatments, coronavirus?specific treatments, and antiviral treatments should be useful in fighting COVID?19.

Analysis of Adoption and Utilization","abstract":"Background\nUse of social media has become widespread across the United States.\n\n Although businesses have invested in social media to engage consumers and promote products, less is known about the extent to which hospitals are using social media to interact with patients and promote health.\n\n\nObjective\nThe aim was to investigate the relationship between hospital social media extent of adoption and utilization relative to hospital characteristics.\n\n\nMethods\nWe conducted a cross-sectional review of hospital-related activity on 4 social media platforms: Facebook, Twitter, Yelp, and Foursquare.\n\n All US hospitals were included that reported complete data for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems survey and the American Hospital Association Annual Survey.\n\n We reviewed hospital social media webpages to determine the extent of adoption relative to hospital characteristics, including geographic region, urban designation, bed size, ownership type, and teaching status.\n\n Social media utilization was estimated from user activity specific to each social media platform, including number of Facebook likes, Twitter followers, Foursquare check-ins, and Yelp reviews.\n\n\nResults\nAdoption of social media varied across hospitals with 94.41% (3351/3371) having a Facebook page and 50.82% (1713/3371) having a Twitter account.\n\n A majority of hospitals had a Yelp page (99.14%, 3342/3371) and almost all hospitals had check-ins on Foursquare (99.41%, 3351/3371).\n\n Large, urban, private nonprofit, and teaching hospitals were more likely to have higher utilization of these accounts.\n\n\nConclusions\nAlthough most hospitals adopted at least one social media platform, utilization of social media varied according to several hospital characteristics.\n\n This preliminary investigation of social media adoption and utilization among US hospitals provides the framework for future studies investigating the effect of social media on patient outcomes, including links between social media use and the quality of hospital care and services.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4260061","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"JMIR Publications

Media by Western European Hospitals: Longitudinal Study","abstract":"Background\nPatients increasingly use social media to communicate.\n\n Their stories could support quality improvements in participatory health care and could support patient-centered care.\n\n Active use of social media by health care institutions could also speed up communication and information provision to patients and their families, thus increasing quality even more.\n\n Hospitals seem to be becoming aware of the benefits social media could offer.\n\n Data from the United States show that hospitals increasingly use social media, but it is unknown whether and how Western European hospitals use social media.\n\n\nObjective\nTo identify to what extent Western European hospitals use social media.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this longitudinal study, we explored the use of social media by hospitals in 12 Western European countries through an Internet search.\n\n We collected data for each country during the following three time periods: April to August 2009, August to December 2010, and April to July 2011.\nResults\nWe included 873 hospitals from 12 Western European countries, of which 732 were general hospitals and 141 were university hospitals.\n\n The number of included hospitals per country ranged from 6 in Luxembourg to 347 in Germany.\n\n We found hospitals using social media in all countries.\n\n The use of social media increased significantly over time, especially for YouTube (n = 19, 2% to n = 172, 19.7%), LinkedIn (n =179, 20.5% to n = 278, 31.8%), and Facebook (n = 85,

well as its use.\n\n Social media usage differs significantly between countries.\n\n Except for the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, the group of hospitals that is using social media remains small.\n\n Usage of LinkedIn for recruitment shows the awareness of the potential of social media.\n\n Future research is needed to investigate how social media lead to improved health

and has the potential to augment public health communication.\n\n However, there is a lack of reported data on social media adoption within public health settings.\n\n The purposes of this study were to assess: 1) the extent to which state public health departments (SHDs) are using social media; 2) which social media applications are used most often; and 3) how often social media is used interactively to engage audiences.\n\n\nMethods\nThis was a non-experimental, cross sectional study of SHD social media sites.\n\n Screen capture software Snag-It® was used to obtain screenshots of SHD social media sites across five applications.\n\n These sites were coded for social media presence, interactivity, reach, and topic.\n\n\nResults\nSixty percent of SHDs reported using at least one social media application.\n\n Of these, 86.7% had a Twitter account, 56% a Facebook account, and 43% a YouTube channel.\n\n There was a statistically significant difference between average population density and use of social media (p = .\n\n01).\n\n On average, SHDs made one post per day on social media sites, and this was primarily to distribute information; there was very little interaction with audiences.\n\n SHDs have few followers or friends on their social media sites.\n\n The most common topics for posts and tweets related to staying healthy and diseases and conditions.\n\n Limitations include the absence of a standard by which social media metrics measure presence, reach, or interactivity; SHDs were only included if they had an institutionally maintained account; and the study was cross sectional.\n\n\nConclusions\nSocial media use by public health agencies is in the early adoption stage.\n\n However, the reach of social media is limited.\n\n SHDs are using social media as a channel to distribute information rather than capitalizing on the interactivity available to create conversations and engage with the audience.\n\n If public health agencies are to effectively use social media then they must develop a strategic communication plan that incorporates best practices for expanding reach and fostering interactivity and engagement.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3331826","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

Analysis of Information Sharing, Engagement, and Action","abstract":"Background\nSocial media offers unprecedented opportunities for public health to engage audiences in conversations and collaboration that could potentially lead to improved health conditions.\n\n While there is some evidence that local health departments (LHDs) are using social media and Twitter in particular, little is known about how Twitter is used by LHDs and how they use it to engage followers versus disseminating one-way information.\n\n\nObjective\nTo examine how LHDs use Twitter to share information, engage with followers, and promote action, as well as to discover differences in Twitter use among LHDs by size of population served.\n\n\nMethods\nThe Twitter accounts for 210 LHDs were stratified into three groups based on size of population served (n=69 for less than 100,000; n=89 for 100,000-499,999; n=52 for 500,000 or greater).\n\n A sample of 1000 tweets was obtained for each stratum and coded as being either about the organization or about personal-health topics.\n\n Subcategories for organization included information, engagement, and action.\n\n Subcategories for personal health included information and action.\n\n\nResults\nOf all LHD tweets (n=3000), 56.1% (1682/3000) related to personal health compared with 39.5% (1186/3000) that were about the organization.\n\n Of the personal-health tweets, 58.5% (984/1682) involved factual information and 41.4% (697/1682) encouraged action.\n\n Of the organization-related tweets, 51.9% (615/1186) represented one-way communication about the organization and its events and services, 35.0% (416/1186) tried to engage followers in conversation, and 13.3% (158/1186) encouraged action to benefit the organization (eg, attend events).\n\n Compared with large LHDs, small LHDs were more likely to post tweets about their organization (Cramer’s V=0.06) but were less likely to acknowledge events and accomplishments of other organizations (?2=12.83, P=.\n\n02, Cramer’s V=0.18).\n\n Small LHDs were also less likely to post personal health-related tweets (Cramer’s V=0.08) and were less likely to post tweets containing suggestions to take action to modify their lifestyle.\n\n While large LHDs were more likely to post engagement-related tweets about the organization (Cramer’s V=0.12), they were less likely to ask followers to take action that would benefit the organization (?2=7.59, P=.\n\n02. Cramer’s V=0.08).\n\n While certain associations were statistically significant, the Cramer’s V statistic revealed weak associations.\n\n\nConclusions\nTwitter is being adopted by LHDs, but its primary use involves one-way communication on personal-health topics as well as organization-related information.\n\n There is also evidence that LHDs are starting to use Twitter to engage their audiences in conversations.\n\n As public health transitions to more dialogic conversation and engagement, Twitter’s potential to help form partnerships with audiences and involve them as program participants may lead to action for improved health.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3758023","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"JMIR Publications Inc.","authors":[{"firstname":"Gunther","surname":"Eysenbach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kristen","surname":"Lovejoy","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Kristen","surname":"Lovejoy","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Michaël","surname":"Laurent","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Brad L","surname":"Neiger","email":"neiger@byu.edu","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Brad L","surname":"Neiger","email":"neiger@byu.edu","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rosemary","surname":"Thackeray","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Scott H","surname":"Burton","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Callie R","surname":"Thackeray","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jennifer H","surname":"Reese","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.giq.2017.04.001","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Use of social media for e-Government in the public health sector: A systematic review of published studies","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1108/JSIT-06-2015-0052","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Uses and gratifications of social media: a comparison of microblog and WeChat","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1186/1471-2458-8-319","date":"2008-09-20","title":"An analysis of hospital preparedness capacity for public health emergency in four regions of China: Beijing, Shandong, Guangxi, and Hainan","abstract":"Background\nHospital preparedness is critical for the early detection and management of public health emergency (PHE).\n\n Understanding the current status of PHE preparedness is the first step in planning to enhance hospitals' capacities for emergency response.\n\n The objective of this study is to understand the current status of hospital PHE preparedness in China.\n\n\nMethods\nFour hundred hospitals in four city and provinces of China were surveyed using a standardized questionnaire.\n\n Data related to hospital demographic data;

Out of a total 203 viral tweets, 166 (82.8%) were classified as 'Informative', of which 48 (28.6%) had weblinks to government-based sources, while 19 (9.4%) were 'Morale-boosting' and 14 (6.9%) were 'Political'. Numbers of followers and viral tweets were not strictly related.\nConclusions\nTwitter may represent a powerful tool for world leaders to rapidly communicate public health information with citizens. We would urge general caution when using Twitter for health information, with a preference for tweets containing official government-based information sources.\nIntroduction\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization, because of 'alarming levels' of spread, severity and inaction. As of 25th March 2020, there are over 414 000 cases globally and over 18 400 deaths. The causative novel human coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2, is primarily transmitted by respiratory droplet spread and direct contact; moreover, it can also survive in air. Transmission is also possible in asymptomatic carriers. It is therefore crucial that world leaders mount effective public health measures to limit human-to-human transmission, including hand hygiene, social distancing and self-isolation.\nTwitter may represent a powerful public health tool for world leaders to rapidly and directly communicate information on COVID-19 to citizens, in addition to more conventional media such as television, radio and newspapers. Twitter is a free microblogging social media website with 152 million registered daily users. Furthermore, over 500 million people visit Twitter per month without logging into an account.\nThe Group of Seven (G7) is an international intergovernmental organization, which comprises the seven most advanced economies in the world according to the International Monetary Fund: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the USA. The European Union (EU) is also an invitee to the G7, represented by the Presidents of the EU Council and EU Commission. The language used by world leaders, such as the G7 heads of state, can influence the opinions and behaviour of citizens. Furthermore, the nature of communication by political leaders affects public policy outcomes. Thus, political leaders can use their influence over public opinion to address public health issues, ideally by disseminating evidence-based public health information.\nA MEDLINE search for the keywords 'COVID-19' and 'Twitter' delivered no results. Thus, to our knowledge, this qualitative study is the first to evaluate the role of Twitter as used by G7 world leaders in response to COVID-19. Content analysis is performed exclusively for 'viral' tweets, meaning those which rapidly spread across a high number of users.\n Primary research objective: To explore how G7 world leaders are using Twitter in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nTo determine what proportion of G7 world leaders use Twitter and assess their reach (followers);\nTo perform content analysis for all G7 world leaders' viral tweets and classify into appropriate themes;\nTo evaluate associated characteristics of these tweets, including weblinks to official government-based information sources and use of video; and\nTo determine what proportion of these tweets are in non-English languages.\n Secondary research objectives:  \nMethods\nJustin Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada;\nEmmanuel Macron, President of France;\nAngela Merkel, Chancellor of Germany;\nGiuseppe Conte, Prime Minister of Italy;\nShinzo Abe, Prime Minister of Japan;\nBoris Johnson, Prime Minister of the UK;\nDonald Trump, President of the US;\nCharles Michel, President of the EU Council; and\nUrsula von der Leyen, President of the EU Commission.\nVerified Twitter accounts were sought for the following G7 members: \nThe advanced Twitter search function was used to filter by the following inclusion criteria: keywords 'COVID-19' or 'coronavirus'; search dates 17th November 2019-17th March 2020 (inclusive); and viral tweets. There is no strict definition for what constitutes a 'viral' tweet:we stipulated a minimum of 500 'likes'. Primary tweets meeting these criteria, plus any secondary tweets as part of a viral thread, were included in our analysis. No language restrictions were stipulated; Twitter's built-in Google translate function was used for non-English tweets. Exclusion criteria were as follows: non-verified Twitter accounts and non-viral tweets.\nData were analysed on 18th March 2020 from a UK IP address. The following outcome measures were recorded: name, number of followers, number of viral tweets, number of associated weblinks to official government-based information sources, top tweet characteristics, languages used and number of viral videos with views. Top tweet characteristics included 'likes', 'retweets' and 'comments'. A 'like' indicates that a registered Twitter user appreciates the tweet, while a 'retweet' indicates that they have shared the tweet on their own Twitter page and a 'comment' indicates that they have added written commentary for the tweet. All of these actions increase the reach of the viral tweet in question. Content analysis was performed by the lead author (SRR) to identify and categorize viral tweets into key themes.\nThis study has been reported as per the Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research. No ethical approval was required as all data (tweets) were retrieved from the public domain.\nResults\nVerified Twitter accounts were identified for eight out of nine (88.9%) G7 members; no active account was identified for Angela Merkel, Chancellor of Germany. Results for all outcome measures are displayed in Table 1. The included G7 members had a total following of 85.7 million Twitter users, and 203 viral tweets on COVID-19. 56 (27.6%) viral tweets were in non-English languages, including French, German, Italian and Japanese. All non-English tweets were successfully translated into English using Twitter's built-in Google translate function.\nResults from COVID-19 Twitter search\nName, G7 Member Nationa	Followers (million)	Viral tweetsb	Theme: n (%):Of which contained government weblinks: n (%)	Top tweetc: likes, retweets and comments (thousand)	Viral videosd, n; total views (million)	Non-English language tweets: n (%)	 	Justin Trudeau	4.7	61	Informative: 61 (100.0)-27 (44.3)	61.8, 10.7, 4.0	N/A	French: 1 (1.6)	 	Emmanuel Macron	4.6	24	Informative: 15 (62.5)-2 (13.3) Morale-boosting: 9 (37.5)	134.1, 29.9, 4.2	3; 2.8	French: 22 (91.7)	 	Giuseppe Conte	0.4	8	Informative: 7 (87.5)-5 (71.4) Morale-boosting: 1 (12.5)	16.4, 2.8, 1.4	2; 0.2	Italian: 8 (100.0)	 	Shinzo Abe	1.7	20	Informative: 19 (95.0)-1 (5.2) Morale-boosting: 1 (5.0)	27.0, 66.7, 4.9	1; 0.9	Japanese: 20 (100.0)	 	Boris Johnson	1.6	16	Informative: 15 (93.8)-8 (53.3) Morale-boosting: 1 (6.3)	9.5, 1.7, 1.4	6; 3.1	N/A	 	Donald Trump	71.4	51	Informative: 32 (62.7)-3 (9.4) Morale-boosting: 5 (9.8) Political: 14 (27.5)	289.3, 81.3, 78.4	2; 4.1	N/A	 	Charles Michel	1.1	2	Informative: 2 (100.0)	0.5, 0.3, 0.1	N/A	N/A	 	Ursula von der Leyen	0.2	21	Informative: 19 (90.5) -2 (10.5) Morale-boosting: 2 (9.5)	20.0, 6.7, 2.9	5; 1.3	French: 1 (4.8); German: 1 (4.8); Italian: 2 (9.5)	 	Total	85.7	203	Informative: 168 (82.8)-48 (28.6) Morale-boosting: 19 (9.4) Political: 14 (6.9)	558.6, 200.1, 97.3	19; 12.4	French: 24 (11.8); German: 2 (1.0); Italian: 10 (4.9); Japanese: 20 (9.9)	 	\n\naG7 Members' verified Twitter accounts ('handles') were as follows: @JustinTrudeau; @EmmanuelMacron; @GiuseppeConteIT; @AbeShinzo; @BorisJohnson; @realDonaldTrump; @eucopresident; @vonderleyen; and no active Twitter account was identified for Angela Merkel.\n\nbViral tweet defined as attracting at least 500 likes on the subject of 'COVID-19' or 'coronavirus'.\n\ncTop tweet defined as that with the highest number of likes.\n\ndAll viral Twitter videos were embedded within viral informative tweets.

Our findings demonstrate that Twitter can be a powerful tool to rapidly communicate with citizens during public health crises: to inform, to boost morale and even to politicize. The majority of viral tweets fell within the 'Informative' category. We are pleased to see dissemination of information from official government-based sources including the UK's National Health Service (NHS), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the individual G7 members' national departments of health. As this search was performed from a UK IP address, we were particularly reassured that a weblink to the NHS COVID-19 advice webpage appeared above all search results in this study, as well as the Twitter page for the Department of Health and Social Care.\nWhat is already known on this topic\nThe communication and language used by world leaders can influence the opinions and behaviour of the public. World leaders can use their influence to address crises, especially by disseminating evidence-based information. On the bicentennial of her birth, consider the example of Florence Nightingale's extraordinary use of publicity and statistics to promote public health, reform hospitals, inspire and educate.\nIt is essential however to consider the impact of misinformation and propaganda during times of crisis and conflict. For example, the atrocious use of propaganda by the Nazis led to the demonization and mass murder of Jewish people. Misinformation may also negatively impact views of the public on health matters. A recent content analysis of data from The Washington Post revealed a plurality of misleading statements made by the US President Donald Trump on the subject of healthcare, particularly relating to the Affordable Care Act. However, one would hope that in instances where official government-based sources are referenced or signposted, the risk of misinformation should be reduced.\nAlthough no studies of Twitter during COVID-19 were revealed by our MEDLINE search, several previous studies have suggested a role for Twitter data during other public health outbreaks including Middle East respiratory syndrome, SARS, Ebola virus disease, Zika virus, H1N1 ('swine flu') and H7N9 ('avian flu'). Suggested roles for Twitter include infectious disease surveillance, predicting spread of disease, dissemination of public health information and assessing public views toward public health outbreaks.\nWhat this study adds\nTo our knowledge, this study is the first to analyze the usage of Twitter by G7 world leaders in response to COVID-19. Our search strategy replicates a typical search by a member of the public seeking tweets from on the subject of COVID-19, using the keywords 'COVID-19' and 'coronavirus'. This study has determined that the majority of tweets fell within the 'Informative' category. We feel that these 'Informative' tweets, followed by 'Morale-boosting' tweets, are generally more helpful than 'Political' tweets from a public health perspective. Our study has also determined the proportion of non-English tweets by G7 world leaders and highlighted that this language barrier was easily overcome through Twitter's in-built Google translate function. We have evaluated the characteristics of viral tweets, including the use of government weblinks and viral videos to share information. Conducting this study highlighted the user-friendly nature of Twitter in searching information on COVID-19, due to concise content (limited to 280 characters per tweet) and the ability to quickly translate non-English tweets where necessary.\nOur study found that the G7 leaders have a large following on Twitter:a combined total of 85.7 million followers. A disproportionately high number of followers were attributed to the Twitter account of US President Donald Trump. This may in part be due to his previous celebrity status through reality television and popular culture. Indeed, musician Justin Bieber has 111 million followers as of 26th March 2020:considerably more than the G7 leaders combined. However, our study demonstrated that the number of followers does not necessarily translate into more viral tweets:indeed, highest number of COVID-19 viral tweets were sent from the account of Justin Trudeau, President of Canada. This is because it is not necessary to follow a Twitter account in order to view, like, retweet or comment on a tweet sent from said account. Furthermore, the 19 viral videos embedded within 'Informative' tweets attracted a total of 12.4 million views, indicating that the number of 'likes' alone underestimates the true reach of viral tweets.\nInterestingly, this study highlighted that Angela Merkel, Chancellor of Germany, is the only G7 world leader who does not appear to have a verified and active Twitter account. Thus, the use of Twitter is not crucial for world leaders due to alternative forms of communication including television, radio, newspapers and indirect inclusion in social media by other users.\nOur methodology could also be applied to a range of other Twitter user groups in response to COVID-19 or other health issues. These might include other politicians, celebrities, organisations, charities and other entities. Interestingly, Twitter is censored in the People's Republic of China, so this study's methodology cannot be applied.\nLimitations of this study\nThis study has a number of limitations. First, this study likely underestimates the true reach of Twitter as these G7 members' tweets could have been viewed without 'liking' them or even needing an account. Furthermore, in-depth analysis of the reach of these tweets is beyond the remit of this study. We also acknowledge that the resulting themes were decided by the first author, albeit he is trained in thematic analysis. Others might apply different terms to certain content. Our study only included tweets with the keywords 'COVID-19' or 'coronavirus' to maintain a focused search. It is however possible that some relevant tweets were missed if they did not specifically include these words. Our study only included G7 members, on the basis that they represent prominent world leaders across several nations. Further research could evaluate the usage of Twitter by other politicians from different countries. Finally, the threshold of 500 likes to qualify as a viral tweet was an arbitrary one determined a priori in the absence of a strict definition from the literature, albeit it resulted in a good range of data across all included G7 member nations.\nConclusion\nThis study has demonstrated the widespread use of Twitter by the majority of G7 world leaders with many viral tweets on the subject of COVID-19. The majority of viral tweets were 'Informative', and many had weblinks to official government-based sources.

The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and

until February 17, 2020. However, 5,298 additional patients were confirmed until March 4, 2020. Therefore, our objective was to estimate the reproduction number (R) and evaluate the effectiveness of preventive measures.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA COVID-19 transmission model (SEIHR) was established to suit the Korean outbreak.\n\n The number of daily confirmed cases in Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province (NGP), the main area of outbreak, was used.\n\n The first patient’ symptom onset date in the Daegu/NGP outbreak was assumed as January 22, 2020. The R according to the start date of the effect of preventive measures was estimated.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe estimated R in Hubei Province, China, was 4.0281, whereas the estimated initial R in Korea was 0.555, but later in Daegu/NGP, the value was between 3.472 and 3.543. When the transmission period decreases from 4-day to 2-day, the outbreak ends early, but the peak of the epidemic increases, and the total number of patients does not change greatly.\n\n It was found that, if transmission rate decreases, the outbreak ends early, and the size of the peak and the total number of patients also decreases.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nTo end the COVID-19 epidemic, efforts to reduce the spread of the virus, such as social distancing and wearing masks, are absolutely crucial with the participation of the public, along with the policy of reducing the transmission period by finding and isolating patients as quickly as possible through the efforts of the quarantine authorities.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7285447","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Korean Society of

Coronaviridae, has assessed the placement of the human pathogen, tentatively named 2019-nCoV, within the Coronaviridae.\n Based on phylogeny, taxonomy and established practice, the CSG recognizes this virus as forming a sister clade to the prototype human and bat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs) of the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, and designates it as SARS-CoV-2. In order to facilitate communication, the CSG proposes to use the following naming convention for individual isolates: SARS-CoV-2/host/location/isolate/date.\n While the full spectrum of clinical manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections in humans remains to be determined, the independent zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 highlights the need for studying viruses at the species level to complement research focused on individual pathogenic viruses of immediate significance.\n This will improve our understanding of virus–host interactions in an ever-changing environment and enhance our preparedness for future outbreaks.\n","id":"PMC7095448","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing Group UK","authors":[{"firstname":"Alexander E.","surname":"Gorbalenya","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Susan C.","surname":"Baker","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ralph S.","surname":"Baric","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Raoul J.","surname":"de Groot","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Christian","surname":"Drosten","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Anastasia A.","surname":"Gulyaeva","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Bart L.","surname":"Haagmans","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chris","surname":"Lauber","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Andrey M.","surname":"Leontovich","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Benjamin W.","surname":"Neuman","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Dmitry","surname":"Penzar","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Stanley","surname":"Perlman","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Leo L.

Conserved Homotrimer Cavity Formed by the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein: A Novel Binding Site","abstract":"An important stage in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) life cycle is the binding of the spike (S) protein to the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) host cell receptor.\n Therefore, to explore conserved features in spike protein dynamics and to identify potentially novel regions for drugging, we measured spike protein variability derived from 791 viral genomes and studied its properties by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation.\n The findings indicated that S2 subunit (heptad-repeat 1 (HR1), central helix (CH), and connector domain (CD) domains) showed low variability, low fluctuations in MD, and displayed a trimer cavity.\n By contrast, the receptor binding domain (RBD) domain, which is typically targeted in drug discovery programs, exhibits more sequence variability and flexibility.\n Interpretations from MD simulations suggest that the monomer form of spike protein is in constant motion showing transitions between an “up” and “down” state.\n In addition, the trimer cavity may function as a “bouncing spring” that may facilitate the homotrimer spike protein interactions with the ACE2 receptor.\n The feasibility of the trimer cavity as a potential drug target was examined by structure based virtual screening.\n Several hits were identified that have already been validated or suggested to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 virus in published cell models.\n In particular, the data suggest an action mechanism for molecules including

Nontraditional Data Sources for Near Real-Time Estimation of Transmission Dynamics During the 2015-2016 Colombian Zika Virus Disease Outbreak","abstract":"Background\nApproximately 40 countries in Central and South America have experienced local vector-born transmission of Zika virus, resulting in nearly 300,000 total reported cases of Zika virus disease to date.\n\n Of the cases that have sought care thus far in the region, more than 70,000 have been reported out of Colombia.\n\n\nObjective\nIn this paper, we use nontraditional digital disease surveillance data via HealthMap and Google Trends to develop near real-time estimates for the basic (R0) and observed (Robs) reproductive numbers associated with Zika virus disease in Colombia.\n\n We then validate our results against traditional health care-based disease surveillance data.\n\n\nMethods\nCumulative reported case counts of Zika virus disease in Colombia were acquired via the HealthMap digital disease surveillance system.\n\n Linear smoothing was conducted to adjust the shape of the HealthMap cumulative case curve using Google search data.\n\n Traditional surveillance data on Zika virus disease were obtained from weekly Instituto Nacional de Salud (INS) epidemiological bulletin publications.\n\n The Incidence Decay and Exponential Adjustment (IDEA) model was used to estimate R0 and Robs for both data sources.\n\n\nResults\nUsing the digital (smoothed HealthMap) data, we estimated a mean R0 of 2.56 (range 1.42-3.83) and a mean Robs of 1.80 (range 1.42-2.30).\n\n The traditional (INS) data yielded a mean R0 of 4.82 (range 2.34-8.32) and a mean Robs of 2.34 (range 1.60-3.31).\n\n\nConclusions\nAlthough modeling using the traditional (INS) data yielded higher R0 estimates than the digital (smoothed HealthMap) data, modeled ranges for Robs were comparable across both data sources.\n\n As a result, the narrow range of possible case projections generated by the traditional (INS) data was largely encompassed by the wider range produced by the digital (smoothed HealthMap) data.\n\n Thus, in the absence of traditional surveillance data, digital surveillance data can yield similar estimates for key transmission parameters and should be utilized in other Zika virus-affected countries to assess outbreak dynamics in near real time.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4909981","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"JMIR

Analysis of the 2012-2013 Influenza Epidemic","abstract":"Social media have been proposed as a data source for influenza surveillance because they have the potential to offer real-time access to millions of short, geographically localized messages containing information regarding personal well-being.\n However, accuracy of social media surveillance systems declines with media attention because media attention increases “chatter” – messages that are about influenza but that do not pertain to an actual infection – masking signs of true influenza prevalence.\n This paper summarizes our recently developed influenza infection detection algorithm that automatically distinguishes relevant tweets from other chatter, and we describe our current influenza surveillance system which was actively deployed during the full 2012-2013 influenza season.\n Our objective was to analyze the performance of this system during the most recent 2012–2013 influenza season and to analyze the performance at multiple levels of geographic granularity, unlike past studies that focused on national or regional surveillance.\n Our system’s influenza prevalence estimates were strongly correlated with surveillance data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the United States (r = 0.93, p &lt; 0.001) as well as surveillance data from the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene of New York City (r = 0.88, p &lt; 0.001).\n Our system detected the weekly change in direction (increasing or decreasing) of influenza prevalence with 85% accuracy, a nearly twofold increase over a simpler model, demonstrating the utility of explicitly distinguishing infection tweets from other chatter.\n","id":"PMC3857320","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

Case Study of the New York City 2012-2013 Influenza Season With Daily Geocoded Twitter Data From Temporal and Spatiotemporal Perspectives","abstract":"Background\nTwitter has shown some usefulness in predicting influenza cases on a weekly basis in multiple countries and on different geographic scales.\n\n Recently, Broniatowski and colleagues suggested Twitter’s relevance at the city-level for New York City.\n\n Here, we look to dive deeper into the case of New York City by analyzing daily Twitter data from temporal and spatiotemporal perspectives.\n\n Also, through manual coding of all tweets, we look to gain qualitative insights that can help direct future automated searches.\n\n\nObjective\nThe intent of the study was first to validate the temporal predictive strength of daily Twitter data for influenza-like illness emergency department (ILI-ED) visits during the New York City 2012-2013 influenza season against other available and established datasets (Google search query, or GSQ), and second, to examine the spatial distribution and the spread of geocoded tweets as proxies for potential cases.\n\n\nMethods\nFrom the Twitter Streaming API, 2972 tweets were collected in the New York City region matching the keywords “flu”, “influenza”, “gripe”, and “high fever”.\n\n The tweets were categorized according to the scheme developed by Lamb et al.\n\n A new fourth category was added as an evaluator guess for the probability of the subject(s) being sick to account for strength of confidence in the validity of the statement.\n\n Temporal correlations were made for tweets against daily ILI-ED visits and daily GSQ volume.\n\n The best models were used for linear regression for forecasting ILI visits.\n\n A weighted, retrospective Poisson model with SaTScan software (n=1484), and vector map were used for spatiotemporal analysis.\n\n\nResults\nInfection-related tweets (R=.\n\n763) correlated better than GSQ time series (R=.\n\n683) for the same keywords and had a lower mean average percent error (8.4 vs 11.8) for ILI-ED visit prediction in January, the most volatile month of flu.\n\n SaTScan identified primary outbreak cluster of high-probability infection tweets with a 2.74 relative risk ratio compared to medium-probability infection tweets at P=.\n\n001 in Northern Brooklyn, in a radius that includes Barclay’s Center and the Atlantic Avenue Terminal.\n\n\nConclusions\nWhile others have looked at weekly regional tweets, this study is the first to stress test Twitter for daily city-level data for New York City.\n\n Extraction of personal testimonies of infection-related tweets suggests Twitter’s strength both qualitatively and quantitatively for ILI-ED prediction compared to alternative daily datasets mixed with awareness-based data such as GSQ.\n\n Additionally, granular Twitter data provide important spatiotemporal insights.\n\n A tweet vector-map may be useful for visualization of city-level spread when local gold standard data are otherwise unavailable.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4259880","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"JMIR Publications

consequence of the 2015–2016 Latin American outbreak.\n\n Official government-led case count data in Latin America are typically delayed by several weeks, making it difficult to track the disease in a timely manner.\n\n Thus, timely disease tracking systems are needed to design and assess interventions to mitigate disease transmission.\n\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nWe combined information from Zika-related Google searches, Twitter microblogs, and the HealthMap digital surveillance system with historical Zika suspected case counts to track and predict estimates of suspected weekly Zika cases during the 2015–2016 Latin American outbreak, up to three weeks ahead of the publication of official case data.\n\n We evaluated the predictive power of these data and used a dynamic multivariable approach to retrospectively produce predictions of weekly suspected cases for five countries: Colombia, El Salvador, Honduras, Venezuela, and Martinique.\n\n Models that combined Google (and Twitter data where available) with autoregressive information showed the best out-of-sample predictive accuracy for 1-week ahead predictions, whereas models that used only Google and Twitter typically performed best for 2- and 3-week ahead predictions.\n\n\nSignificance\nGiven the significant delay in the release of official government-reported Zika case counts, we show that these Internet-based data streams can be used as timely and complementary ways to assess the dynamics of the outbreak.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5268704","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library

has undergone significant expansion over the past hundred years.\n\n Understanding what factors limit the distribution of transmission can be used to predict current and future limits to further dengue expansion.\n\n While not the only factor, temperature plays an important role in defining these limits.\n\n Previous attempts to analyse the effect of temperature on the geographic distribution of dengue have not considered its dynamic intra-annual and diurnal change and its cumulative effects on mosquito and virus populations.\n\n\nMethods\nHere we expand an existing modelling framework with new temperature-based relationships to model an index proportional to the basic reproductive number of the dengue virus.\n\n This model framework is combined with high spatial and temporal resolution global temperature data to model the effects of temperature on Aedes aegypti and Ae.\n\n albopictus persistence and competence for dengue virus transmission.\n\n\nResults\nOur model predicted areas where temperature is not expected to permit transmission and/or Aedes persistence throughout the year.\n\n By reanalysing existing experimental data our analysis indicates that Ae.\n\n albopictus, often considered a minor vector of dengue, has comparable rates of virus dissemination to its primary vector, Ae.\n\n aegypti, and when the longer lifespan of Ae.\n\n albopictus is considered its competence for dengue virus transmission far exceeds that of Ae.\n\n aegypti.\n\n\nConclusions\nThese results can be used to analyse the effects of temperature and other contributing

for the comparative rarity of dengue transmission in established Ae.\n\n albopictus populations.\n\n This suggests that the limited capacity of Ae.\n\n albopictus to transmit DENV is more dependent on its ecology than vector competence.\n\n The recommendations, which we explicitly outlined here, point to clear targets for entomological

habitats and Aedes albopictus larval population surveys were conducted from May to November 2013 in three areas representing rural, suburban, and urban settings in Guangzhou, China.\n\n Ae.\n\n albopictus adults were collected monthly using BG-Sentinel traps.\n\n Ae.\n\n albopictus larva and adult life-table experiments were conducted with 20 replicates in each of the three study areas.\n\n\nResults\nThe urban area had the highest and the rural area had the lowest number of aquatic habitats that tested positive for Ae.\n\n albopictus larvae.\n\n Densities in the larval stages varied among the areas, but the urban area had almost two-fold higher densities in pupae and three-fold higher in adult populations compared with the suburban and rural areas.\n\n Larvae developed faster and the adult emergence rate was higher in the urban area than in suburban and rural areas.\n\n The survival time of adult mosquitoes was also longer in the urban area than it was in suburban and rural areas.\n\n Study regions, surface area, water depth, water clearance, surface type, and canopy coverage were important factors associated with the presence of Ae.\n\n albopictus larvae.\n\n\nConclusions\nUrbanization substantially increased the density, larval development rate, and adult survival time of Ae.\n\n albopictus, which in turn potentially increased the vector capacity, and therefore, disease transmissibility.\n\n Mosquito ecology and its correlation with dengue virus transmission should be compared in different environmental settings.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4230920","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

Influenza Outbreaks Using Both Search Engine Query Data and Social Media Data in South Korea","abstract":"Background\nAs suggested as early as in 2006, logs of queries submitted to search engines seeking information could be a source for detection of emerging influenza epidemics if changes in the volume of search queries are monitored (infodemiology).\n\n However, selecting queries that are most likely to be associated with influenza epidemics is a particular challenge when it comes to generating better predictions.\n\n\nObjective\nIn this study, we describe a methodological extension for detecting influenza outbreaks using search query data; we provide a new approach for query selection through the exploration of contextual information gleaned from social media data.\n\n Additionally, we evaluate whether it is possible to use these queries for monitoring and predicting influenza epidemics in South Korea.\n\n\nMethods\nOur study was based on freely available weekly influenza incidence data and query data originating from the search engine on the Korean website Daum between April 3, 2011 and April 5, 2014. To select queries related to influenza epidemics, several approaches were applied: (1) exploring influenza-related words in social media data, (2) identifying the chief concerns related to influenza, and (3) using Web query recommendations.\n\n Optimal feature selection by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) and support vector machine for regression (SVR) were used to construct a model predicting influenza epidemics.\n\n\nResults\nIn total, 146 queries related to influenza were generated through our initial query selection approach.\n\n A considerable proportion of optimal features for final models were derived from queries with reference to the social media data.\n\n The SVR model performed well: the prediction values were highly correlated with the recent observed influenza-like illness (r=.\n\n956; P&lt;.\n\n001) and virological incidence rate (r=.\n\n963; P&lt;.\n\n001).\n\n\nConclusions\nThese results demonstrate the feasibility of using search queries to enhance influenza surveillance in South Korea.\n\n In addition, an approach for query selection using social media data seems ideal for supporting influenza surveillance based on search query data.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4949385","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"JMIR Publications","authors":[{"firstname":"Gunther","surname":"Eysenbach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Elaine","surname":"Nsoesie","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Elaine","surname":"Nsoesie","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Soo-Yong","surname":"Shin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hyekyung","surname":"Woo","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Hyekyung","surname":"Woo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Youngtae","surname":"Cho","email":"youngtae@snu.ac.kr","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Youngtae","surname":"Cho","email":"youngtae@snu.ac.kr","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Eunyoung","surname":"Shim","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Eunyoung","surname":"Shim","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jong-Koo","surname":"Lee","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Jong-Koo","surname":"Lee","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chang-Gun","surname":"Lee","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Chang-Gun","surname":"Lee","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Seong Hwan","surname":"Kim","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Seong Hwan","surname":"Kim","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.14778/2367502.2367532","date":"1970-01-01","title":"ASTERIX: an open source system for big data management and analysis","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Twitter.com.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the rapidly spreading COVID-19 outbreak to be a pandemic, and countries around the world are grappling with surges in confirmed cases. This outbreak has changed the lives of many people in many countries. With millions of people forced out of public spaces, many conversations about these phenomena now take place on social media.\nHowever, the accuracy and credibility of this conversation is often concerning and challenging for public health officials, especially because the authors of this information are often unknown. In addition, data available on public platforms such as Twitter provide unique insights that are challenging to identify due to data size, recentness, and geographic scale. Misinformation is spreading rapidly as people struggle to understand how best to protect themselves and the people around them. Therefore, it is important to ensure that people seek information from proper sources on social media platforms. Seeking information from these outlets ensures the flow of relevant, accurate, and high-quality information about the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, which can help control the pandemic. An example of a proper source is a medical professional.\nCurrently, social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook are being used by medical professionals around the world and have become important players in the COVID-19 pandemic. These platforms are used by medical professionals to provide patient care and education, increase personal awareness of news and discoveries, and provide health information to the community. Furthermore, these platforms are increasingly popular for sharing and debating scientific information. For example, Glowacki et al analyzed tweets about electronic cigarettes posted by physicians from two countries, the United Kingdom and the United States; they found that physicians discussed important topics such as the likelihood of electronic cigarette use among teenagers, Food and Drug Administration regulations on tobacco, measures of the sources of harm inherent to any kind of tobacco use, and references to a Harvard study on the effects of flavoring chemicals on the lungs. In addition, Alpert and Womble addressed how physicians navigate Twitter and their challenges and benefits of using the platform. The results showed that physicians used Twitter for reach and presence, to express concerns and apprehension, for networking, news, and education, for patient engagement, and to advocate against misinformation. Finally, Chaudhry et al addressed the extent to which oncologists used Twitter during annual meetings. The results showed that physicians mainly used Twitter to report clinical news from scientific sessions, discuss treatment issues, for promotion, and to provide social commentary.\nIn summary, prior research demonstrates the potential of mining social media to uncover useful information regarding a variety of health care-related issues. However, no study to date has examined communities of medical professionals on social media to identify themes and discussion topics about the COVID-19 pandemic. These posts can help identify topics that are important to the community and can serve as a gauge for measuring concerns about potential threats. With the rapid outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and the global effort to fight it, this research aims to extract medical professionals' insights about the coronavirus pandemic. From a practical perspective, the research identifies proactive actions, recommendations, and knowledge that can help control the pandemic.\nMethods\nMethodology\nTo analyze posts by medical professionals on social media, we used a mixed methods approach blending the capabilities of a social media analytics tool, Crimson Hexagon, with the capabilities of a qualitative analysis tool, NVivo (QSR International), for data collection and analysis (Figure 1).\nResearch methodology.\nIn general, the methodology started with data collection. The researchers agreed on a data range of interest, target social media platform, target users, keywords used to search for online posts, and restrictions to impose. Second, qualitative analysis was conducted using NVivo to explore the collected data to identify relevant tweets, infer prominent concepts, and then identify the main themes in the data. Qualitative analysis can be used to uncover important concepts and develop an understanding about a phenomenon. A popular method for qualitative analysis is qualitative coding, which was adopted in this study. Qualitative coding is the process of assigning descriptive or inferential labels to chunks of data, which may assist concept development. Third, a data analytics tool, Crimson Hexagon, was used for opinion analysis of the predefined categories. Crimson Hexagon, a social media analytics company that is now part of Brandwatch, employs unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques and a text analysis model developed by Hopkins and King.\nData Collection\nOur target social media platform for data collection was Twitter. Initially, we identified 119 medical professionals who were actively discussing the COVID-19 pandemic on Twitter. The medical professionals were identified by searching the Onalytica website, which specializes in providing influencer marketing software, and finding a list of top health care professionals ranked by influence score. Also, we used the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, which provides a comprehensive COVID-19 case tracker as well as other useful information about COVID-19, including the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 Experts/Centers account on Twitter. The Twitter IDs of the medical professionals were used to identify the target users. Next, using Crimson Hexagon with the search query shown in Figure 2, we extracted all tweets for the identified medical professionals between December 1, 2019 and April 1, 2020. A total of 10,096 English tweets were collected. The key advantage of using a social media analytics platform such as Crimson Hexagon is that it provides access to the &quot;Twitter firehose&quot; (ie, every public tweet ever posted on Twitter in any language and from any geographic location that meets the search criteria).\nSearch query used with Crimson Hexagon.\nData Analysis\nFor the data analysis, we started by identifying relevant tweets. To do this, a random subset of 250 tweets were analyzed by three researchers to determine which tweets were relevant to the COVID-19 pandemic. Three researchers independently labeled the tweets as relevant or not relevant. To ensure that the obtained results were reliable and consistent, we followed a case study protocol and established interrater reliability. We obtained a Fleiss kappa value of 0.628, which is at the bottom of the range that reflects substantial agreement (0.61-0.80) and is just above the range that reflects moderate agreement (0.41-0.60).\nNext, we performed automatic coding of the relevant tweets using NVivo, a tool that helps organize and analyze a wide variety of data, including but not limited to documents, images, audio, video, and social medial content. Automatic coding was used to assist the process of concept development related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The results of the automatic coding process are shown in Multimedia Appendix 1. Once the main codes and subcodes were identified, three researchers worked together via a combination of inductive and deductive thinking to identify conceptual categories. The goal was to build a descriptive, multi-dimensional preliminary framework for later analysis. Based on the main code and subcode analysis, we were able to identify eight main categories/themes, namely information and knowledge, symptoms and illness, fighting misinformation, infection and transmission, testing, actions and recommendations, the health care system, and immunity.\nWe initially used Crimson Hexagon to define the categories from the qualitative analysis and the associated trained algorithm to explore the medical professional opinion surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. Multimedia Appendix 1 describes each of the categories, lists the keywords delineating each of the categories, and provides a representative tweet for each. Using Multimedia Appendix 1 as a codebook, we manually labeled the categories and automatically distributed 10,096 tweets over 9 categories: the 8 categories from qualitative analysis and 1 additional category for irrelevant tweets. The training was an iterative process, ensuring that each category was clearly outlined by the examples. The number of coded tweets increased over several runs of the model as we reviewed the categories and coded more tweets.\nResults\nTweet Distribution and Categories\nA total of 10,096 English tweets were collected between December 1, 2019 and April 1, 2020 from a total of 119 providers, of which 29 (24.4%) were female, 59 (49.6%) were male, and 31 (26.0%) were of unknown gender. The average number of tweets per provider was 84.8. The distribution of tweets per country is shown in Figure 3; the majority of tweets were from medical professionals located in the United States.\nDistribution of tweets by country.\nThe distribution of the tweets over the categories identified using qualitative analysis is shown in Figure 4. Overall, the results demonstrate that relevant tweets account for 92% of the collected tweets, and irrelevant tweets account for 8%. Irrelevant tweets are tweets posted by medical professionals that do not discuss COVID-19. For example, tweets that reference websites links, such as &quot;words have never been more well-spoken. #coronavirus #coronavirusoutbreak #covid19&quot; or tweets that make announcements about TV interviews, such as &quot;I gave interview last month where I was asked &quot;Is COVID-19 going to be like Zika, where nobody was really affected in the end?&quot; and &quot;It's great to see the media interviewing actual experts on epidemics about #COVID19!&quot; The distribution of the relevant tweets was as follows: actions and recommendations (2827/10,096, 28%), fighting misinformation (2019/10,096, 20%), information and knowledge (911/10,096, 9%), health care system (909/10,096, 9%), symptoms and illness (810/10,096, 8%), immunity (707/10,096, 7%), testing (605/10,096, 6%), and infection and transmission (503/10,096, 5%).\nPercentages of tweets per category.\nFigure 5 shows the volume of tweets over time by category. As shown in the figure, the number of posted tweets increased with time. More tweets were posted as the number of COVID-19 cases increased. The number of tweets posted about actions and recommendations increased noticeably, followed by tweets posted about fighting misinformation.\nTrends of tweets per category from December 2019 to April 2020.\nActions and Recommendations\nOverall, the tweets revealed the important topics about the COVID-19 pandemic that medical professionals discussed during the period of the study. Medical professionals provided a wide range of actions and recommendations that must be considered by the government, public health officials, and individuals. These actions and recommendations mainly focused on flattening the curve, quarantine, self-isolation, social distancing, staying at home, and personal self-care. According to Multimedia Appendix 2, tweets related to &quot;must quarantine,&quot; &quot;social distancing,&quot; &quot;flattening,&quot; and &quot;curve&quot; dominated this category. Example tweet:\nThis is the time to #preparenotpanic for #COVID2019 Here are my tips 1. good hand hygiene (wash hands with soap and water or use alcohol-based hand gel) 2. cover your cough and sneeze 3. if sick stay at home 4. discuss sick leave rules with work.\nFighting Misinformation\nMedical professionals also discussed concerns related to misinformation and how dangerous and misleading it is to share and report such information. Furthermore, they encouraged the public to seek updates from government officials and trusted sources. According to Multimedia Appendix 3, tweets related to &quot;misinformation&quot; and &quot;disinformation&quot; dominated this category. Medical professionals discussed information related to the virus infection and transmission. Example tweet:\nAlong with infectious disease epidemics come misinformation/hysteria epidemics. The latter spreads faster and is just as dangerous. We need responsible reporting; accurate information; and the media needs to avoid using panic/fear to sell headlines. #coronavirus #nCoV2019\nHealth Care System\nMedical professionals shared their opinions regarding the health care system during the COVID-19 pandemic. They shared information and concerns regarding health care workers and their safety and whether the health care system can accommodate the increasing numbers of patients with COVID-19. According to Multimedia Appendix 4, tweets related to &quot;healthcare,&quot; &quot;hospitals,&quot; &quot;system,&quot; &quot;patients,&quot; and &quot;workers&quot; dominated this category. Example tweet:\nWe will need LOTS of help, including delivery of food and medicine, support of health care facilities, or direct patient care.\nInformation and Knowledge\nMedical professionals posted tweets about general COVID-19 pandemic information and knowledge. This information and knowledge included recent statistics and comparisons between countries and general information about the virus not directly related to any of the other categories. According to Multimedia Appendix 5, tweets related to &quot;information,&quot; &quot;important,&quot; and &quot;knowledge&quot; dominated this category. Example tweet:\n#coronaviruses are enveloped viruses, meaning they are coated with a membrane derived from the host cell.\nSymptoms and Illness\nMedical professionals also shared their knowledge about the symptoms and illnesses associated with COVID-19. According to the tweets in this category, people infected with COVID-19 can have a range of symptoms, from none to severe. The tweets indicated that some patients with COVID-19 can have no immediate symptoms or no symptoms at all (asymptomatic), most patients seem to have no or mild symptoms, and some patients have pneumonia or breathing issues. According to Multimedia Appendix 6, tweets related to &quot;symptoms,&quot; &quot;asymptomatic,&quot; &quot;illness,&quot; &quot;mild,&quot; and &quot;severe&quot; dominated this category. Example tweet:\nPeople who have contracted new #coronavirus are showing a wide range of symptoms. Of known cases, most people exhibit milder symptoms, but about 1 in 5 people have severe illness, including #pneumonia and respiratory failure.\nImmunity\nMedical professionals shared thoughts and opinions about how our immune systems respond and react to the virus as well as theories related to immunity. According to Multimedia Appendix 7, tweets related to &quot;immunity,&quot; &quot;herd,&quot; &quot;strategy,&quot; and &quot;immune&quot; dominated this category. Example tweet:\nCollecting antibodies from those who recover from coronavirus infections is certainly a strategy to consider, &amp; various countries are looking at this. Personally, I would prefer to give convalescent plasma to a patient with knowledge that it contains a decent amount of antibodies.\nTesting\nThe medical professionals also discussed testing in their tweets. These discussions were mainly about testing as the most viable option to control the disease, concerns about testing, and the need to scale up testing and expand testing capabilities. According to Multimedia Appendix 8, tweets related to &quot;testing,&quot; &quot;test,&quot; &quot;kits,&quot; &quot;lab,&quot; &quot;mild,&quot; and &quot;severe&quot; dominated this category. Example tweet:\nWe need to be thinking outside the box: drive-thru testing &amp; home-based testing. This will help expand testing options for patients.\nInfection and Transmission\nMedical professionals also discussed information related to virus infection and transmission. According to Multimedia Appendix 9, tweets related to &quot;transmission,&quot; &quot;spread,&quot; &quot;outbreak,&quot; and &quot;infected&quot; dominated this category. Example tweet:\nIts good news that young children appear not to suffer severe #COVID19 illness. Unfortunately, the bad news is that these kids can readily spread the #coronavirus to others who are at much higher risk for serious illness.\nDiscussion\nPrincipal Findings\nThe collected data and analysis show that social media content reveals important topics that medical professionals perceive as relevant to the ongoing discourse about the COVID-19 pandemic. These topics are mainly related to actions and recommendations, fighting misinformation, the health care system, information and knowledge, symptoms and illness, immunity, testing, and infection and transmission. Interestingly, tweets relating to actions and recommendations and concerns about misinformation accounted for more than 50% of relevant tweets, while health care system-related tweets accounted for less than 10% of relevant tweets. This is revealing given that discussion of shortages of medical supplies and limitations of the health care system seems to dominate mainstream media. However, while medical professionals are concerned about the health care system, from their perspective, the importance of actions and recommendations reflects a proactive stance to combat a pandemic that currently has no effective treatment and for which a vaccine will not be available for a long time. Tweets in this category peaked around mid-March, coinciding with the ongoing effort to curtail the pandemic, and included extensive references to approaches such as social distancing, quarantining, and contact tracing. These approaches are considered to be the first response to new infectious diseases. While the volume of tweets has declined since mid-March, there was an uptick toward early April, potentially coinciding with conversations associated with the appropriate timing for &quot;opening&quot; the economy and associated measures that may be needed to keep the pandemic in check.\nFurthermore, misinformation is a major concern for medical professionals; this was addressed in many tweets, which emphasized how this misleading information could lead to infection of more people with the virus. In a sense, some tweets suggested that the spread of misinformation was equally as disconcerting as the spread of COVID-19. Although the actual process by which such infection and spread could occur due to misleading information is not clear, there is ongoing effort by government and public health organizations such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and WHO to disseminate credible information about the state of the pandemic. This effort is imperative to develop interventions to fight misinformation in cases where high quality information may literally be a life-and-death concern. As of April 1, 2020, this topic remained second with respect to tweet volume, indicating continued concern. Implications for public health include the need to expand the reach of credible information about various aspects of the virus, including symptoms, treatment, testing, vaccination, and progression. It is also important to increase public awareness about the duty to share information wisely and the importance of seeking information from trusted sources such as medical professionals.\nConcerns were also shared about health care systems and health care workers. Medical professionals expressed concern that the increase in the number of cases will lead to collapse of the health care system and that the shortage of medical personal protective equipment (PPE) will increase the likelihood that health care workers will be infected. According to the CDC, it is critical to make every effort to protect the essential national workforce of health care providers, both at work and in the community. Also, CDC data show that PPE shortages are posing challenges to the health care system because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Examples of suggested measures include scaling up existing facilities, provisioning field hospitals, and directing resources to support ailing health care infrastructure in a timely and proactive manner. Interestingly, the number of tweets showed a declining trend toward the end of the analysis period, potentially reflecting the global effort to ramp up health care infrastructure and the adaption of health care providers to the fledging health crisis.\nIn addition, medical professionals shared their knowledge and information about the symptoms associated with COVID-19; they stated that a person with COVID-19 can show a wide range of symptoms and it is even possible that they will show no symptoms at all. This is aligned with the existing literature, where accumulating evidence is indicating that a substantial fraction of people infected with COVID-19 are asymptomatic. These posts reflect less than 20% of all relevant posts; however, they reflect another opportunity for medical professionals to influence the course of the pandemic by helping to disseminate credible and accurate information about the disease. This role can also extend to proactively debunking misinformation. While the volume of tweets showed a declining trend after mid-March, it is encouraging to note that there was an uptick toward the end of the analysis period.\nIssues related to how the human immune system acts and reacts with the virus were also discussed. Most notably, medical professionals were concerned about the fact that some countries are considering herd immunity as an option to address the COVID-19 pandemic. This option is criticized because it is practically impossible to perfectly tune actual interventions without exceeding or undershooting the capacity of the health care system. Interestingly, immunity shows a consistent upward trend during the analysis period among all topics. This trend is likely to continue as health care professionals, policymakers, and communities attempt to determine the role of the immune system (particularly post-infection) in suppressing the likelihood of future infections and how these findings can impact future courses of action.\nMedical professionals tweeted about testing as the most urgent and efficient option to control the spread of COVID-19 while there is no effective treatment or vaccine. Given the magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic, effective testing can reduce or prevent the need for much greater intrusions. Suggested measures included increasing testing, surveillance, and detection as much as possible, adopting drive-through testing, and rapid scaleup of diagnostic testing outside of hospitals.\nFinally, information about how the virus infects people, transmits from person to person, and spreads in communities was shared by different medical professionals. In this category, there was a significant emphasis on the role of the public in stemming the transmission of the infection. This information included the need to practice social distancing, basic personal hygiene, and self-quarantining after potential exposure to COVID-19.\nLimitations\nThis research has a number of limitations due to its reliance on social media. For example, despite the breadth of tweets collected, not all medical professionals use Twitter, and those who do use Twitter use a significant amount of discretion with respect to their level of engagement with the platform. There are also temporal and geographic dimensions that are not necessarily captured. The findings from the analysis could be improved through additional refinement of the defined categories and by focusing on specific categories (eg, actions and recommendations). In addition, the data collection could be complemented with surveys of medical professionals with more focused and specific questions to better understand their specific concerns and experience.\nConclusions\nIn this research, we analyzed tweets by medical professionals on social media to understand topics, insights, and information about the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. Using a mixed methods approach that blended social media analytics and qualitative analysis, this research revealed trending themes and topics of concern by medical professionals about the novel coronavirus. While this health crisis is still unfolding, this study provides a unique perspective of medical professionals during the early stages of the pandemic outside of China. At this stage, a sizeable volume of tweets pertained to proactive actions to combat the virus and to recognition of the scale of the spread of misinformation as well as its adverse effects on the ongoing effort to fight the pandemic. Other issues characterizing this stage included concern about the current status of the health care system, the dissemination of information about the disease, the role of testing to better assess the scope of the crisis and properly target mitigation efforts, and the potential response of the human immune system.\nConflicts of Interest: None declared.\nAppendix\nAbbreviations\nCDC\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention\nCOVID-19\ncoronavirus disease\nPPE\npersonal protective equipment\nWHO\nWorld Health Organization\nE-Cigarette Topics Shared by Medical Professionals: A Comparison of Tweets from the United States and United Kingdom\nSocial media and health care professionals: benefits, risks, and best practices\nTemporal and spatiotemporal investigation of tourist attraction visit sentiment on Twitter\nYou Are What You Tweet: Connecting the Geographic Variation in America's Obesity Rate to Twitter Content\nEbola, Twitter, and misinformation: a dangerous combination?\nAccess to digital and social media among Romanian HIV/AIDS clinical providers\nMedical Professional and Usage of Social Media\nWearable devices for health and wellbeing: Design Insights from Twitter\nTweeting nano: how public discourses about nanotechnology develop in social media environments\nJust What the Doctor Tweeted: Physicians' Challenges and Rewards of Using Twitter\nTrends in twitter use by physicians at the american society of clinical oncology annual meeting, 2010 and 2011\nQualitative review of usability problems in health information systems for radiology\nUsing Machine Learning to Support Qualitative Coding in Social Science\nRelationship between urinary sodium excretion and pioglitazone-induced edema\nThe Measurement of Observer Agreement for Categorical Data\nGrounded Theory Methodology in Information Systems Research\nCovid-19 : The Law and Limits of Quarantine\nFighting COVID-19 misinformation on social media: Experimental evidence for a scalable accuracy nudge intervention\nCharacteristics of Health Care Personnel with COVID-19 - United States, February 12-April 9, 2020\nEstimating the asymptomatic proportion of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship, Yokohama, Japan, 2020\nA phased lift of control: a practical strategy to achieve herd immunity against Covid-19 at the country level\nDisease Control, Civil Liberties, and Mass Testing : Calibrating Restrictions during the Covid-19 Pandemic\n","References depth 1":[{"doi":"10.1089/cyber.2016.0409","date":"1970-01-01","title":"E-Cigarette Topics Shared by Medical Professionals: A Comparison of Tweets from the United States and United Kingdom","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Social media and health care professionals: benefits, risks, and best practices","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[]},{"doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0198857","date":"2018-05-25","title":"Temporal and spatiotemporal investigation of tourist attraction visit sentiment on Twitter","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a sentiment-based approach to investigate the temporal and spatiotemporal effects on tourists’ emotions when visiting a city’s tourist destinations.\n Our approach consists of four steps: data collection and preprocessing from social media;

hedonometer.\n In building our metric, made available with this paper, we conducted a survey to obtain happiness evaluations of over 10,000 individual words, representing a tenfold size improvement over similar existing word sets.\n Rather than being ad hoc, our word list is chosen solely by frequency of usage, and we show how a highly robust and tunable metric can be constructed and

diet","abstract":"Background\nPeople overeat because their hunger directs them to consume more calories than they require.\n\n The purpose of this study was to analyze the changes in experience and perception of hunger before and after participants shifted from their previous usual diet to a high nutrient density diet.\n\n\nMethods\nThis was a descriptive study conducted with 768 participants primarily living in the United States who had changed their dietary habits from a low micronutrient to a high micronutrient diet.\n\n Participants completed a survey rating various dimensions of hunger (physical symptoms, emotional symptoms, and location) when on their previous usual diet versus the high micronutrient density diet.\n\n Statistical analysis was conducted using non-parametric tests.\n\n\nResults\nHighly significant differences were found between the two diets in relation to all physical and emotional symptoms as well as the location of hunger.\n\n Hunger was not an unpleasant experience while on the high nutrient density diet, was well tolerated and occurred with less frequency even when meals were skipped.\n\n Nearly 80% of respondents reported that their experience of hunger had changed since starting the high nutrient density diet, with 51% reporting a dramatic or complete change in their experience of hunger.\n\n\nConclusions\nA high micronutrient density diet mitigates the unpleasant aspects of the experience of hunger even though it is lower in calories.\n\n Hunger is one of the major impediments to successful weight loss.\n\n Our findings suggest that it is not simply the caloric content, but more importantly, the micronutrient density of a diet that influences the experience of hunger.\n\n It appears that a high nutrient density diet, after an initial phase of adjustment during which a person experiences 'toxic hunger' due to withdrawal from pro-inflammatory foods, can result in a sustainable eating pattern that leads to weight loss and improved health.\n\n A high nutrient density diet provides benefits for long-term health as well as weight loss.\n\n Because our findings have important implications in the global effort to control rates of obesity and related chronic diseases, further studies are needed to confirm these preliminary results.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2988700","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

(i.\ne.\n, publishing and tweeting frequency) and of their tweet construction and affordance use (i.\ne.\n use of hashtags, language, and emotions) on the conversational connections they have on Twitter.\n We found that astrophysicists communicate with a variety of user types (e.\ng.\n colleagues, science communicators, other researchers, and educators) and that in the ego networks of the astrophysicists clear groups consisting of users with different professional roles can be distinguished.\n Interestingly, the analysis of noun phrases and hashtags showed that when the astrophysicists address the different groups of very different professional composition they use very similar terminology, but that they do not talk to each other (i.\ne.\n mentioning other user names in tweets).\n The results also showed that in those areas of the ego networks that tweeted more the sentiment of the tweets tended to be closer to neutral, connecting frequent tweeting with information sharing activities rather than conversations or expressing opinions.\n","id":"PMC4143334","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

have the potential to offer real-time access to millions of short, geographically localized messages containing information regarding personal well-being.\n However, accuracy of social media surveillance systems declines with media attention because media attention increases “chatter” – messages that are about influenza but that do not pertain to an actual infection – masking signs of true influenza prevalence.\n This paper summarizes our recently developed influenza infection detection algorithm that automatically distinguishes relevant tweets from other chatter, and we describe our current influenza surveillance system which was actively deployed during the full 2012-2013 influenza season.\n Our objective was to analyze the performance of this system during the most recent 2012–2013 influenza season and to analyze the performance at multiple levels of geographic granularity, unlike past studies that focused on national or regional surveillance.\n Our system’s influenza prevalence estimates were strongly correlated with surveillance data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the United States (r = 0.93, p &lt; 0.001) as well as surveillance data from the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene of New York City (r = 0.88, p &lt; 0.001).\n Our system detected the weekly change in direction (increasing or decreasing) of influenza prevalence with 85% accuracy, a nearly twofold increase over a simpler model, demonstrating the utility of explicitly distinguishing infection tweets from other chatter.\n","id":"PMC3857320","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"David

which is further challenged by a range of access complexities, it is unclear how often – and which kinds of – social media clinicians use to support clinical care.\n This study was conducted to ascertain social media use for clinical providers based in two regions of Romania (Transylvania and Moldavia) who face distance challenges that could potentially be alleviated by social media

Or are online survey samples via sources such as Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) so different from the average social media user that the survey responses of one group give little insight into the on-platform behavior of the other? Here we investigate these issues by examining 67 pieces of political news content.\n We evaluate whether there is a meaningful relationship between (i) the level of sharing (tweets and retweets) of a given piece of content on Twitter, and (ii) the extent to which individuals (total N = 993) in online surveys on MTurk reported being willing to share that same piece of content.\n We found that the same news headlines that were more likely to be hypothetically shared on MTurk were also shared more frequently by Twitter users, r = .\n44. For example, across the observed range of MTurk sharing fractions, a 20 percentage point increase in the fraction of MTurk participants who reported being willing to share a news headline on social media was associated with 10x as many actual shares on Twitter.\n We also found that the correlation between sharing and various features of the headline was similar using both MTurk and Twitter data.\n These findings suggest that self-reported sharing intentions collected in online surveys are likely to provide some meaningful insight into what content would actually be shared on social media.\n","id":"PMC7010247","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Mohsen","surname":"Mosleh","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gordon","surname":"Pennycook","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Gordon","surname":"Pennycook","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"David G.","surname":"Rand","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Jaros?aw","surname":"Jankowski","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Jaros?aw","surname":"Jankowski","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.3758/s13428-015-0576-1","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Is the Cognitive Reflection Test a measure of both reflection and intuition?","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.31234/osf.io/3n9u8","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Understanding and reducing the spread of misinformation online","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1177/0963721415604610","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Everyday consequences of analytic thinking","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1073/pnas.1806781116","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Fighting misinformation on social media using crowdsourced judgments of news source quality","abstract":"Many people consume news via social media.\n It is therefore desirable to reduce social media users’ exposure to low-quality news content.\n One possible intervention is for social media ranking algorithms to show relatively less content from sources that users deem to be untrustworthy.\n But are laypeople’s judgments reliable indicators of quality, or are they corrupted by either partisan bias or lack of information? Perhaps surprisingly, we find that laypeople—on average—are quite good at distinguishing between lower- and higher-quality sources.\n These results indicate that incorporating the trust ratings of laypeople into social media ranking algorithms may prove an effective intervention against misinformation, fake news, and news content with heavy political bias.\n","id":"PMC6377495","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"National Academy of Sciences","authors":[{"firstname":"Gordon","surname":"Pennycook","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"David G.","surname":"Rand","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"David G.","surname":"Rand","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.cognition.2018.06.011","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Lazy, not biased: Susceptibility to partisan fake news is better explained by lack of reasoning than by motivated reasoning","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1037/rev0000017","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Believing what we do not believe: Acquiescence to superstitious beliefs and other powerful intuitions","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Beyond &quot;fake news&quot;: The role of analytic thinking in the detection of inaccuracy and partisan bias in news headlines","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Afraid of coronavirus?

statistical model that is considered to capture the data-generating process of the outbreak and virus surveillance, maximum likelihood estimation of the asymptomatic ratio was implemented.\n\n\nResults\nAssuming that all norovirus outbreaks (n = 55) were the result of random sampling from an identical distribution and ignoring genogroup and genotype specificities, the asymptomatic ratio was estimated at 32.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 27.7–36.7).\n\n Although not significant, separate estimation of the asymptomatic ratio of the GII.\n\n4 genotype appeared to be greater than other genotypes and was estimated at 40.7% (95% CI, 32.8–49.0).\n\n\nConclusion\nThe present study offered the first explicit empirical estimates of the asymptomatic ratio of norovirus infection in natural infection settings.\n\n The estimate of about 30% was consistent with those derived from volunteer challenge studies.\n\n Practical difficulty in controlling GII.\n\n4 outbreaks

features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China,

The exaggerated information on COVID-19 had big negative influence upon Russian society and healthcare system, despite SARS-CoV-2 relatively low epidemiological hazard.\nINTRODUCTION\nFocus\nProfessor John Ioannidis clearly demonstrated that a threat of false or unconfirmed information on COVID-19 might endanger almost all scopes of life. In chapters 6 and 7 of his communication, he drew our attention to a hazard of wrong, highly biased allocation of resources. In Russia, with already 232 243 persons tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (official Russian governmental data as of 12 May 2020), we currently face such a situation in healthcare sector. In our article, we study negative social impact of exaggerated information about COVID-19 on Russian society and healthcare system.\nProblematic overview\nSince the beginning of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, many states, including European countries, faced massive stress for their healthcare systems. Such situation has been recently reported for Italy, Austria, Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Spain, France, USA, India, China, and Turkey. A thorough analysis of informational coverage of the virus spread shows that distorted information was one of the major causes of excessive, inappropriate and often inconsistent actions in public and healthcare policy.\nA few recent examples are instructive. In UK, the population stress related to exaggerated news on COVID-19, resulted in the increased number of heart attacks through elderly people. In Germany, Robert Koch Institute continues to issue its daily reports with a warning assessment message &quot;The RKI currently assesses the risk to the health of the German population overall as high and as very high for risk groups&quot;. Such evaluations were revealed to cause large anxiety and mental stress among nursing staff in Germany, particularly in Berlin. In Italy, especially in Lombardy, many people got scared to call the emergency and potentially be hospitalized due to the risk of COVID-19 contraction in a hospital. Consequently, many COVID-unrelated cases that had required immediate interference, remained unobserved by medical personnel.\nSucharit Bhakdi and Daniel von Wachter drew our attention to obvious harms of uncritical treating the information about COVID-19 by politicians, administration and society in Germany as well as disproportional public and healthcare policy measures. In January 2020, Wolfgang Sassin emphasised the inappropriateness of German administrative steps aimed at mitigating epidemiological and demographical hazards. \nTherefore, the lessons learned from the Russian negative and positive experience with COVID-19 containment may have heuristic value for healthcare sectors of other European countries, since similar challenges are now faced in almost every country.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nSurvey\nWe surveyed medical care personnel of different levels by obtaining written responses to our questionnaire. The medical staff in question works in five Moscow hospitals transformed to infectious disease infirmaries for treating only COVID-19 patients, and six ambulance centres. The data obtained were treated semantically and afterwards statistically. 231 doctors, 317 nurses and 355 ambulance medical workers of lower levels (medical assistants) have been surveyed in total.\nContent analysis\nContent analysis was used as a technique of studying social reaction to COVID-19 exaggerated information in Russian segment of social networks VKontakte, Facebook, Instagram, Odnoklassniki, Twitter. 3164 accounts have been analysed. Content analysis of Russian media (seven TV news broadcasts and eight talk shows on primary and secondary TV channels, official governmental websites on counteracting COVID-19) was also performed.\nTime range\nCollecting the primary data was carried out since 2 March to 10 May 2020.\nSoftware\nMS Visual Studio 2010 (C#) was used for analysing the data obtained in the survey..NET Framework 4.5 tools were used to write a proprietary C#-coded module for social networks content analysis. MS PowerPoint 2013 was used for creating the Figure 1.\nPositive-feedback loop that causes current overheating of Russian healthcare system. Acronyms used: PCR:Polymerase chain reaction (a most common technique for the virus detection); CT:Computer tomography (the lungs state analysis); HR:Human resources\nEthical guidelines\nReporting of the study conforms to broad EQUATOR guidelines. \nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nResults of surveying medical workers\nIn the survey, it became clear that 64.2% of polled doctors and 82.2% of polled medical personnel of lower levels (medical assistants and nurses) (hereinafter the percentage values are produced from the total number of the surveyed, and confidence interval is 95%) were experiencing stress and constant fear to become infected. 47.1% of clinicians with at least MD degree and 70.6% of medical personnel of lower educational levels responded in the poll questionnaire that this fear mainly proceeded from media sources, including TV news and social networks, not from their daily hospital experience. Many of respondents (36.5 and 30.1%) confessed that they probably would have performed their professional duties better, had it not been for their stress and fatigue.\nResults of content analysis of personal posts on COVID-19 in social networks\nOur research demonstrated that the role of using social networks and electronic gadgets in spreading panic throughout Russian hospital clinicians was enormous. Moreover, we concluded that stress and anxiety within medical care were mainly caused by the overall highly nervous social background. This background, in turn, was instigated by false or unproven information on the epidemic.\nThe content analysis of social network personal accounts of Russian-speaking audience with at least one network post concerned with the current epidemic or related matters and written in time interval 25 February:10 May 2020, showed that 81.4% of the authors or disseminators of the posts in question exhibited high degrees of anxiety and even panic brought about by distorted, exaggerated or false information on COVID-19 disease and its causative agent.\nMajor venues of producing misinformation or distorted information about COVID-19 in Russia\nSocial networks (Russian sectors of Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, as well as Russian networks VKontakte and Odnoklassniki) are the primary places of creating, replicating and transmitting dubious, false and unconfirmed information on the epidemic. Shocking &quot;news&quot; on COVID-19 are appearing and being forgotten almost every day, but sometimes they cause dramatic effects on general public. We observed that in the atmosphere of permanent stress and fear, an essential part of Russian social network users (41.9%) tended to believe uncritically in any unconfirmed &quot;facts&quot; about the disease and SARS-CoV-2, whichever fantastic they might seem.\nWorld Health Organisation (WHO) official websites with their real-time statistics, cause considerable negative impact on Russian social network users. The current epidemic is regarded by many as an online real-time show anyone can observe in a 24 x 7 mode. SARS 2002-2004 and H5N1 avian flu 2004-2008 outbreaks passed almost unnoticed by the Russian society, whereas SARS-CoV had at least twofold fatality rate in comparison with SARS-CoV-2 and H5N1 flu at least 10-fold. We see the main reason of it in a much lesser presence of Internet and electronic gadgets in Russia in 2003-2004 in comparison with 2020 (for general public as well as medical workers). WHO's &quot;Confirmed deaths&quot; counter continuous ticking negatively influences audience. Multiple comments in Russian social networks show that almost nobody pays heed to the fact that, on average, a seasonal flu causes greater net fatality every year than COVID-19 caused thus far. We revealed that WHO's &quot;Confirmed deaths&quot; counter was interpreted by Russian public unambiguously as an evidence of the virus utmost danger to the population.\nDaily news on major Russian TV channels are constructed in such a way that they demonstrate the rate of &quot;those who got ill (infected, contaminated and stricken) today from COVID-19&quot; and &quot;perished today form COVID-19.&quot; Even disregarding the dubious nature of the numbers &quot;Confirmed cases&quot; and &quot;Confirmed deaths&quot; introduced by WHO, we observed that using such phraseology created an alarming feeling of war communiques. To perish is to be killed in action. Therefore, the audience watching TV news, starts to panic as it were a wartime (57.3% of analysed social network accounts contained various ideas about parallels between COVID-19 epidemic and alleged World War III). Additionally, the collocation &quot;stricken with COVID&quot; was identified by 62.3% of social network users as an indicator of very high SARS-CoV-2 contagiousness.\nMost of Russian TV talk shows are staged in a similar way. A persistent narrative about &quot;how many people were killed by the virus heretofore&quot; remains their main topic. The only commendable example of a contrary approach is Alexander Gordon's TV show &quot;Doc Talk&quot; where the host and his guests have been trying to find real answers and soothe media psychosis common for Russian TV.\nThe official website of the Russian Official Headquarters on Control and Monitoring of Coronavirus Situation is little informative. A novel and uncommon word &quot;coronavirus&quot; whose meaning was not duly explained by officials of Ministry of Health of Russian Federation, impacted on both Russian society and medical workers negatively. If there had been a clear and timely explanation of the fact that there are four coronaviruses that caused dramatic outbreaks in the very recent past but now transformed to aetiological agents of seasonal acute respiratory infections (human coronaviruses HKU1, OC43, 229E and NL63), a large part of anxiety, stress and fear would have been probably avoided. In addition, common naming SARS-CoV-2 &quot;an unprecedented survival challenge&quot; by Russian media did not mollify the general fears. No mass media notified broad society and medical care workers that the &quot;once-in-a-century virus,&quot; the &quot;virus not encountered thus far&quot; in reality shares around 80% of genetic sequence with SARS-CoV that caused the epidemic of 2002-2004. The results of our survey showed that 48.2% of doctors and 93.3% of medical workers of lower levels (not virologists) had no idea about SARS-CoV-2 being just another representative of human coronaviruses subfamily till the end of the main survey, 26 April 2020. Of 3164 inspected social network accounts, no user exhibited signs of such knowledge. The majority of people use mass media rather than scientific papers, as informational resources. And mass media provide mainly distorted and biased coverage, pouring additional oil on the flames.\nSocial advertisement on TV channels exploiting the children's services was insistent on the major Russian TV channels (1TV, Russia TV, TVC and NTV) in time range 22 March:20 April 2020. Clips with children of 4-8 years appeared constantly with messages to imagined grandmothers and grandfathers. This caused anxiety in 17.4% of doctors and 24.2% of medical personnel of lower levels. 18.2% of social network users also demonstrated signs of nervousness related to these clips.\nInternet search engines most commonly used in Russia, Yandex and Google, paint a web browser page in alarming reddish colours, provide unnecessary disquieting recommendations to a person what he/she should do, and show WHO misleading indicators, on every mentioning &quot;NCoV,&quot; its synonyms or any related matters in a search line. According to our estimations, this is a cause of raising discomposure of 12.8% of social account users.\nIn our analysis, we isolated seven major venues of producing such information.  \nPersistent media symbols related to COVID-19 with misinformation messages\nheaps of coffins;\nmass burials and overloaded crematoriums;\nmedical personnel in Kommunarka hospital (the first hospital that was lately built near Moscow exclusively for treating COVID-19 patients) wearing spacemen-like anti-plague medical protective costumes with gas masks;\ntears of the infected, deemed to reflect severe physical sufferings;\nempty streets demonstrated from distant perspectives;\nclosed or empty Christian temples.\nIn our research, a few persistent media myths created with the help of well-recognisable symbols (several of them were obviously staged-produced) have been demonstrated to lead to the highest level of alarming the Russian network society, including medical workers. These symbols are the following:  \nThese symbols have little to do with the containment of the disease, but, as we found, they cause large negative impact on social network users in Russia.\nPositive-feedback loop of Russian healthcare sector overheating\nWe revealed the following positive-feedback loop (Figure 1). This loop may be regarded as the main reason of Russian healthcare system overheating.\nIn Russia, we currently observe two very dangerous places in this loop. First, there was no initial calculation of need in ventilator intensive care units (ICUs) and general wards for COVID-19 patients by authorities. Fear and distorted information influenced Russian healthcare bureaucrats and a number of other governmental officials who issued the directives to transform excessive amount of hospitals to COVID-19 infirmaries. Only in Moscow, more than twenty hospitals, including highly specialized ones such as cardiovascular, oncological and cerebrovascular, stopped to admit non-COVID patients in March 2020:early April 2020. Additional twenty-four hospitals were transformed later. This amount may be excessive. As a result, many patients were not treated properly by required specialists, who were ordered to focus on COVID-19 patients instead. Many serious non-COVID patients were entrusted to general medical workers with specialisation in different areas of medicine. In addition, too much reliance has been initially put upon mechanical ventilator treatment, whereas only critically ill persons with acute respiratory distress syndrome and respiratory failure must be treated by mechanical ventilators lest a damage to a patient should exceed a potential good. Second, constant media panic brought about an enormous level of calls of general public to ambulance and hospitals. Many people in Russia continue to require to be hospitalized with mildest symptoms of acute respiratory infection even thus far (as of 12 May 2020). Healthcare system usually satisfies such applications, while non-COVID persons who are critically ill may remain without an appropriate and timely medical help at all due to overburdening the care sector by large amount of people in anxiety.\nRegular demonstrating full mass-testing statistics in hospital bulletins/ communiques, media and social networks instead of simple replicating WHO metrics. It will clearly show low contagiousness and fatality rate of SARS-CoV-2 (currently in Russian population, there are 3.94% infected persons, and within this cohort, there are 0.91% deceased persons: 2116 of 232 243 people, as of 12 May 2020 : this is even ascribing every deceased person with SARS-CoV-2 tested to COVID-19, without any further investigation what reason(s) might really cause death);\nRevealing deceptive nature of well-recognisable media symbols created specially to cause shock and stress (coffins, anti-plague medical costumes, mass burials, tears, etc);\nPolitical initiatives aimed at curbing media psychosis.\nWe suggest the following measures to reduce the current stress of medical workers and overheating of healthcare sector:  \nCONCLUSIONS\nThe most serious and urgent problems of Russian healthcare sector related to SARS-CoV-2 are structural and informational problems. The exaggerated and distorted information on COVID-19 has big negative influence upon Russian society and healthcare system, despite SARS-CoV-2 relatively low epidemiological hazard. \nImplementing effective ad hoc search-and-isolate techniques of virus containment aimed at immediate revealing virus carriers instead of imposing lockdown measures on the entire population that violates constitutional and democratic rights of citizens and results in economies disruption, &quot;empty&quot; money printing and budget overloads.\nStricter and more effective epidemiological surveillance in airports, international railway stations and border control premises.\nTechnical preparedness of infectious disease branch of medical care system.\nThorough distinguishing between those patients who really need hospitalisation (seriously ill) and those who may be treated at home (asymptomatic or mild symptomatic patients).\nAllowance of capacities of individual protective units (IPU) for medical personnel and general public. As of late April 2020, in some Russian hospitals transformed to COVID-19 infirmaries, medical workers had to buy third parties' IPUs at their own expense (a similar situation of shortages of IPUs was reported for Italy by Pecchia et al).\nControl of informational coverage of an epidemic on TV media sources. Providing more comprehensive governmental reports on epidemiological situation. These reports shall be made freely available for general public and medical workers. Avoidance of making an online real-time show of an epidemic. Presenting materials on an epidemic in such a way that would not boost panic in society and among clinicians.\nPreparing up-to-date informational press releases in hospitals, ambulance and medical testing centres with relevant information about a pathogen.\nFixing persistent myths, misleading media images and video clips that are going viral in the web, with further professional analysing their mythical character by virologists and other expert researchers.\nTheoretically, in the future we may face a much more dangerous virus that will present a real threat (e.g. a virus with fatality of Ebola and contagiousness of chickenpox). What steps should be taken to avoid similar unpreparedness of the healthcare sector in such a case? We may propose the following measures relevant for both Russia and other countries:  \nFear, panic, disproportional public policy measures and consequent misallocation of resources in medical care system, resulting from the uncritical acceptance of exaggerated and unconfirmed information on SARS-CoV-2, should be contained even faster than the virus itself, if we would like to succeed in the struggle against the disease and continue to be called free and democratic society.\nCONFLICTS OF INTEREST\nThe author declares no conflicts of interest.\nREFERENCES\nCoronavirus disease 2019: the harms of exaggerated information and non-evidence-based measures\nOfficial website of the Russian official headquarters on control and monitoring of coronavirus situation\nReorganization of a large academic hospital to face COVID-19 outbreak: the model of Parma, Emilia-Romagna region, Italy\nImpact of COVID-19 on Nuclear Medicine in Germany, Austria and Switzerland: an international survey in April 2020\nImmediate impact of COVID-19 on transplant activity in the Netherlands\nPostdigital brave new world and its educational implications\nAdaptation of the national plan for the prevention and fight against pandemic influenza to the 2020 COVID-19 epidemic in France\nPreserving stroke care during the COVID-19 pandemic: potential issues and solutions\nStop doing needless things!

Introduction of the MHV resistance mutations into SARS-CoV resulted in the same in vitro resistance phenotype and attenuated SARS-CoV pathogenesis in a mouse model.\n Finally, we demonstrate that an MHV mutant lacking ExoN proofreading was significantly more sensitive to GS-5734. Combined, the results indicate that GS-5734 interferes with the nsp12 polymerase even in the setting of intact ExoN proofreading activity and that resistance can be overcome with increased, nontoxic concentrations of GS-5734, further supporting the development of GS-5734 as a broad-spectrum therapeutic to protect against contemporary and emerging

mainly caused by influenza virus, rhinovirus, adenovirus, coronavirus and respiratory syncytial virus.\n\n The aim of this review was to gather fragmented literature on ethnomedicinal plants used against bronchitis in the Himalayan region and their in-vitro validation against bronchitis causing viral pathogens.\n\n\nKey findings\nPresent review contains ethnomedicines of total 55 plants from different countries of the Himalayas.\n\n Most of the literature reported was from India followed by Pakistan, China and Nepal.\n\n Familiarly used plant families for bronchitis treatment in the Himalayan region were Leguminosae (six plants) and Lamiaceae (five plants).\n\n Leaves and roots were the most common parts used in ethnomedicines against bronchitis.\n\n Of these 55 plants, only six plants have been studied in vitro against viral pathogens causing bronchitis.\n\n Different compounds like monoterpenoids, flavonoids, triterpenoids, iridoid glycosides, sesquiterpenes, benzoic and phenolic compounds were reportedly isolated from these plant extracts having strong antiviral potential.\n\n\nSummary\nThe Himalayan regions possess variety of ethnomedicinal plants used against respiratory diseases, but still there are only few studies related with their in-vitro validation.\n\n We invite the attention of researchers for detailed ethnopharmacological and phytochemical studies on unexplored plants used to treat bronchitis for the development of novel antiviral drugs.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7166987","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Oxford University

situation that warrants urgent global attention.\n Though antiviral drugs are available in mainstream medicine for treating symptoms of swine flu, currently there is no preventive medicine available.\n Even when available, they would be in short supply and ineffective in a pandemic situation, for treating the masses worldwide.\n Besides the development of drug resistance, emergence of mutant strains of the virus, emergence of a more virulent strain, prohibitive costs of available drugs, time lag between vaccine developments, and mass casualties would pose difficult problems.\n In view of this, complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) offers a plethora of interesting preventive possibilities in patients.\n Herbs exhibit a diverse array of biological activities and can be effectively harnessed for managing pandemic flu.\n Potentially active herbs can serve as effective anti influenza agents.\n The role of CAM for managing novel H1N1 flu and the mode of action of these botanicals is presented here in an evidence-based approach that can be followed to establish their potential use in the management of influenza pandemics.\n The complementary and alternative medicine

many poly-herbal formulations due to its potential antidiabetic activity and other health benefits.\n\n The present study was carried out to analyze the anti-stress, anti-allergic, and antiulcer activity of the bioactive compounds present in Gymnema sylvestre leaves.\n\n\nMethods\nThe preliminary phytochemical screening for bioactive compounds from aqueous extracts revealed the presence of alkaloids, triterpenes, flavonoids, steroids, and saponins.\n\n The antioxidant activities were investigated using DPPH radical scavenging method.\n\n The characterization of the extract was carried out using standard compound by High Performance Thin Layer Chromatography (HPTLC) and phytochemical analysis in terms of total phenol, total flavonoids, reducing power and antioxidant potentials, etc.\n\n The in vivo studies on albino mice proved the purified fraction has anti-stress/anti-allergic activity against milk induced leucocytosis/eosinophilia and able to inhibit the aspirin induced gastric ulcers.\n\n\nResults\nThe quantitative estimation for aqueous extract exhibited total antioxidant (9.13?±?0.04 ?g/g), flavonoids (125.62?±?26.84 ?g/g), tannin (111.53?±?15.13 ?g/g), total phenol content (285.23?±?1.11 ?g/g) and free radical scavenging (52.14?±?0.32%).\n\n Further the aqueous extract was consecutively purified by TLC and silica column chromatography.\n\n The purified fractions were characterized by HPTLC and GC-MS and the component was identified as gymnemic acid.\n\n The potency of the antimicrobial activity of the extract was studied with bacteria.\n\n Pharmacological experiments clearly demonstrated that the extracts of all plants given orally showed significant gastric protection against the asprin-induced gastric ulcer model in mice.\n\n Furthermore, healing effects were also confirmed through histopathological examination.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe aqueous extracts of the leaves of Gymnema sylvestre possess anti ulcerogenic, Anti allergic, Anti stress, properties that may be due to cytoprotective mechanism.\n\n These results support the ethno medical uses of the plant in the treatment of gastric

viral pandemic to the world population.\n Current efforts are focused on containment and quarantine of infected individuals.\n Ultimately, the outbreak could be controlled with a protective vaccine to prevent 2019-nCoV infection.\n While vaccine research should be pursued intensely, there exists today no therapy to treat 2019-nCoV upon infection, despite an urgent need to find options to help these patients and preclude potential death.\n Herein, I review the potential options to treat 2019-nCoV in patients, with an emphasis on the necessity for speed and timeliness in developing new and effective therapies in this outbreak.\n I consider the options of drug repurposing, developing neutralizing monoclonal antibody therapy, and an oligonucleotide strategy targeting the viral RNA genome, emphasizing the promise and pitfalls of these approaches.\n Finally, I advocate for the fastest strategy to develop a treatment now, which could be resistant to any mutations the virus may have in the future.\n The proposal is a biologic that blocks 2019-nCoV entry using a soluble version of the viral receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), fused to an immunoglobulin Fc domain (ACE2-Fc), providing a neutralizing antibody with maximal breath to avoid any viral escape, while also helping to recruit the immune system to build lasting immunity.\n The ACE2-Fc therapy would also supplement decreased ACE2 levels in the lungs during infection, thereby directly treating acute respiratory distress pathophysiology as a third mechanism of action.\n The sequence of the ACE2-Fc protein is provided to investigators, allowing its possible use in recombinant protein expression systems to start producing drug today to treat patients under compassionate use, while formal clinical trials are later undertaken.\n Such a treatment could help infected patients before a protective vaccine is developed and widely available in the coming months to year(s).\n","id":"PMC7029759","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"F1000 Research Limited","authors":[{"firstname":"Robert

chemokine genes in the lung.\n Casticin also significantly regulated oxidative stress and reduced inflammation in the lungs of mice with asthma.\n Consequently, inflammatory tracheal epithelial BEAS-2B cells treated with casticin had significantly suppressed levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and eotaxin, and reduced THP-1 monocyte cell adherence to BEAS-2B cells via suppressed ICAM-1

coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and Prevention of Infectious Disease in China, Chinese Academy of

pathogenicity and mortality rates in human populations.\n This brought CoVs global attention and highlighted the importance of controlling infectious pathogens at international borders.\n In this

of the spike proteins (S proteins) on the surface of each of these viruses.\n For building up more suitable animal models, we compare the current animal models recapitulating pathogenesis and summarize the potential role of host receptors contributing to diverse host affinity in various species.\n We outline the research still needed to fully elucidate the pathogenic mechanism of these

novel anti-inflammatory natural product from <italic>Sphaeranthus indicus</italic> inhibits expression of VCAM1 and ICAM1, and slows atherosclerosis progression independent of lipid changes","abstract":"A large body of evidence suggests that atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease, in which cytokines and growth factors play a major role in disease progression.\n The methanolic extracts of Sphaeranthus indicus as well as its active ingredient, 7-hydroxy frullanoide (7-HF), are shown to suppress LPS-induced cytokine production from mononuclear cells, and inhibit the expression of VCAM1, ICAM1 and E-selectin by TNF-?- stimulated HUVECs in a concentration-dependent manner.\n We tested the hypothesis that the inhibition of cytokines and adhesion molecules should attenuate the progression of atherosclerosis, independent of changes in the lipid profile.\n Studies were carried out in two animal models: a high fat-fed LDLr-/- mouse and a high fat-fed hyperlipidemic hamster.\n Methanolic extract of S.\n indicus was dosed to hyperlipidemic LDLr-/- at 100 and 300 mg (equivalent to 20 and 60 mg 7-HF)/kg body weight/ day for 8 weeks, and plasma lipids as well as aortic lesion area were quantitated.\n Hyperlipidemic hamsters were treated with one dose of 200 mg/kg/day.\n S.\n indicus extract treatment did not alter the lipid profile in both animal models, but reduced aortic lesion area in LDLr-/- mice and hyperlipidemic hamsters by 22 % and 45 %, respectively.\n Fenofibrate, included as a reference agent, decreased aortic lesions by 26 % in LDLr -/- mice and 84 % in hyperlipidemic hamsters, respectively, which was driven by massive reductions in proatherogenic lipoproteins.\n The lipid-independent anti-atherosclerotic activity of S.\n indicus was associated with the reductions in the circulating levels of MCP-1, TNF-?, and IL-6 via phosphorylation and degradation of IkB-? that prevents translocation of NF-kB in the nucleus to induce proinflammatory cytokines.\n Our findings demonstrate that anti-inflammatory agents that lower pro-inflammatory proteins inhibit the progression of atherosclerosis.\n The methanolic extract of S.\n inducus, currently being used to treat psoriasis, offer promise to benefit individuals who have high circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines, and predisposed to coronary artery disease.\n","id":"PMC4462118","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Rai Ajit

coronavirus on health services and socio?economic infrastructures, personal safety, and likelihood of voluntary self?isolation.\n\n\nResults\nRespondents most concerned were older, had negative illness attitudes, and scored higher on reward reactivity (RR), indicating the motivation to take positive approach action despite prevailing worry/anxiety.\n\n Personal safety concerns were highest in those with negative illness attitudes and higher fight–flight–freeze system (FFFS, reflecting fear/avoidance) scores.\n\n Results suggest people are experiencing psychological conflict: between the urge to stay safe (FFFF?related) and the desire to maintain a normal, pleasurable (RR?related) life.\n\n Ways of ameliorating conflict may include maladaptive behaviours (panic buying), reflecting reward?related displacement activity.\n\n Intended self?isolation related to FFFS, but also low behavioural inhibition system (related to anxiety) scores.\n\n Older people reported themselves less

non-clinical population","abstract":"Background\nAnimal studies have suggested that the hippocampus may play an important role in anxiety as part of the Behavioural Inhibition System (BIS), which mediates reactivity to threat and punishment and can predict an individual’s response to anxiety-relevant cues in a given environment.\n\n The aim of the present structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study was to examine the relationship between individual differences in BIS and hippocampal structure, since this has not received sufficient attention in non-clinical populations.\n\n Thirty healthy right-handed participants with no history of alcohol or drug abuse, neurological or psychiatric disorders, or traumatic brain injury were recruited (16 male, 14 female, age 18 to 32 years).\n\n T1-weighted structural MRI scans were used to derive estimates of total intracranial volume, and hippocampal and amygdala gray matter volume using FreeSurfer.\n\n To relate brain structure to Gray’s BIS, participants completed the Sensitivity to Punishment questionnaire.\n\n They also completed questionnaires assessing other measures potentially associated with hippocampal volume (Beck Depression Inventory, Negative Life Experience Survey), and two other measures of anxiety (Spielberger Trait Anxiety Inventory and the Beck Anxiety Inventory).\n\n\nResults\nWe found that high scores on the Sensitivity to Punishment scale were positively associated with hippocampal volume, and that this phenomenon was lateralized to the right side.\n\n In other words, greater levels of behavioural inhibition (BIS) were positively associated with right hippocampal volume.\n\n\nConclusions\nOur data suggest that hippocampal volume is related to the cognitive and affective dimensions of anxiety indexed by the Sensitivity to Punishment, and support the idea that morphological differences in the hippocampal formation may be associated with behavioural inhibition contributions to anxiety.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4007806","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

designing behaviour change interventions","abstract":"Background\nImproving the design and implementation of evidence-based practice depends on successful behaviour change interventions.\n\n This requires an appropriate method for characterising interventions and linking them to an analysis of the targeted behaviour.\n\n There exists a plethora of frameworks of behaviour change interventions, but it is not clear how well they serve this purpose.\n\n This paper evaluates these frameworks, and develops and evaluates a new framework aimed at overcoming their limitations.\n\n\nMethods\nA systematic search of electronic databases and consultation with behaviour change experts were used to identify frameworks of behaviour change interventions.\n\n These were evaluated according to three criteria: comprehensiveness, coherence, and a clear link to an overarching model of behaviour.\n\n A new framework was developed to meet these criteria.\n\n The reliability with which it could be applied was examined in two domains of behaviour change: tobacco control and obesity.\n\n\nResults\nNineteen frameworks were identified covering nine intervention functions and seven policy categories that could enable those interventions.\n\n None of the frameworks reviewed covered the full range of intervention functions or policies, and only a minority met the criteria of coherence or linkage to a model of behaviour.\n\n At the centre of a proposed new framework is a 'behaviour system' involving three essential conditions: capability, opportunity, and motivation (what we term the 'COM-B system').\n\n This forms the hub of a 'behaviour change wheel' (BCW) around which are positioned the nine intervention functions aimed at addressing deficits in one or more of these conditions; around this are placed seven categories of policy that could enable those interventions to occur.\n\n The BCW was used reliably to characterise interventions within the English Department of Health's 2010 tobacco control strategy and the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence's guidance on reducing obesity.\n\n\nConclusions\nInterventions and policies to change behaviour can be usefully characterised by means of a BCW comprising: a 'behaviour system' at the hub, encircled by intervention functions and then by policy categories.\n\n Research is needed to establish how far the BCW can lead to more efficient design of effective interventions.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3096582","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

Self-presentation to the emergency department (ED) has been discouraged and the patients’ own fear of being infected by going to the hospital led to also a significant decrease in ED access.\n During the lockdown, in San Giuseppe Hospital MultiMedica IRCCS, Milan, the ED admissions dropped from the mean of 2361/month in December 2019–February 2020 to 1102 (? 53%) and 861 (? 63%) in March and April 2020, respectively.\n For all the above-mentioned reasons, it is possible that some clinical conditions will further progress with a significant increase in morbidity and mortality.\n To prevent this, it is essential that patients with chronic conditions should be at least monitored and managed with telephone or online health consultation, identifying those who need urgent access to care, prioritizing outpatient visits based on disease severity.\n Patients with mild conditions could be managed outside the hospital by implementing telemedicine and creating networks of general practitioners who can consult with in-hospital specialists.\n","id":"PMC7282471","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Springer International Publishing","authors":[{"firstname":"Viganò","surname":"Mauro","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mantovani","surname":"Lorenzo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Cozzolino","surname":"Paolo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Harari","surname":"Sergio","email":"sergio@sergioharari.it","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.jaip.2020.04.012","date":"2020-04-06","title":"Risk Communication During COVID-19","abstract":"During the unprecedented times caused by the novel coronavirus disease 2019, there is rapidly evolving information and guidance.\n However, a focus must also be on proper and effective risk communication.\n This is especially the case during pandemics that have high rates of infection, significant morbidity, lack of therapeutic measures, and rapid increases in cases, all of which apply to the current coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.\n A consequence of poor risk communication and heightened risk perception is hoarding behavior, which can lead to lack of medications and personal protective equipment.\n One potential way to ensure appropriate risk communication is using social media channels, and ensuring an ongoing consistent media presence.\n Another important step is to include all stakeholders including members of the allergy community in broader public health messaging.\n As we continue to face unprecedented times in the allergy community, an understanding and appreciation of risk communication will be essential as we communicate with, and inform, our patients, and our colleagues, moving forward.\n","id":"PMC7158804","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"American Academy of Allergy, Asthma &amp; Immunology","authors":[{"firstname":"Elissa M.","surname":"Abrams","email":"elissa.abrams@gmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Matthew","surname":"Greenhawt","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Offener Brief von Professor Sucharit Bhakdi an Bundeskanzlerin Dr. Angela Merkel.

A total of 378 febrile adult patients (AUFs) with a fever for ?21 days, no evidence of localized infection and negative screening tests for dengue and malaria, and 384 afebrile adult patients (Controls) were prospectively enrolled.\n Whole blood, plasma, eschar swab, throat swab and urine specimens were collected and analysed.\n Quantitative PCR and RT-PCR were used to test for 55 bacteria, viruses and their subtypes.\n Serological tests were also used to test for rickettsial agents.\n The most common aetiology was influenza virus (20.9% in AUFs vs.\n 0% in Controls), followed by rickettsial agents (mainly Orientia tsutsugamushi and Rickettsia typhi) (10.8% vs.\n 0.3%), dengue virus (7.7% vs.\n 0.5%), Leptospira (4.8% vs.\n 0.8%), adenovirus (4.8% vs.\n 1.0%), and enterovirus (2.1% vs.\n 0%) (p?&lt;?.\n05).\n The real proportion of dengue in AUF cases was underestimated because patients with dengue-positive rapid diagnosis tests were excluded from the study.\n The emerging agent Rickettsia felis, which had not been previously observed in Vietnam, was detected in this study.\n In total, 216 patients (57.1%) were given causative diagnoses, comprising 143 (66.2%) monoinfections and 73 (33.8%) coinfections.\n The infections caused by these agents should be considered in clinical practice and further studies.\n Additionally, agents susceptible to doxycycline were detected in 15.6% of AUFs; thus, this drug should be included in the panel used to treat AUF patients.\n","id":"PMC6455186","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Taylor

data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and

Feb 28, 2018, 2182 cases of MERS-CoV infection (with 779 deaths) in 27 countries were reported to WHO worldwide, with most being reported in Saudi Arabia (1807 cases with 705 deaths).\n MERS-CoV features prominently in the WHO blueprint list of priority pathogens that threaten global health security.\n Although primary transmission of MERS-CoV to human beings is linked to exposure to dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius), the exact mode by which MERS-CoV infection is acquired remains undefined.\n Up to 50% of MERS-CoV cases in Saudi Arabia have been classified as secondary, occurring from human-to-human transmission through contact with asymptomatic or symptomatic individuals infected with MERS-CoV.\n Hospital outbreaks of MERS-CoV are a hallmark of MERS-CoV infection.\n The clinical features associated with MERS-CoV infection are not MERS-specific and are similar to other respiratory tract infections.\n Thus, the diagnosis of MERS can easily be missed, unless the doctor or health-care worker has a high degree of clinical awareness and the patient undergoes specific testing for MERS-CoV.\n The largest outbreak of MERS-CoV outside the Arabian Peninsula occurred in South Korea in May, 2015, resulting in 186 cases with 38 deaths.\n This outbreak was caused by a traveller with undiagnosed MERS-CoV infection who became ill after returning to Seoul from a trip to the Middle East.\n The traveller visited several health facilities in South Korea, transmitting the virus to many other individuals long before a diagnosis was made.\n With 10 million pilgrims visiting Saudi Arabia each year from 182 countries, watchful surveillance by public health systems, and a high degree of clinical awareness of the possibility of MERS-CoV infection is essential.\n In this Review, we provide a comprehensive update and synthesis of the latest available data on the epidemiology, determinants, and risk factors of primary, household, and nosocomial transmission of

mixing.\n\n On 3 February, 2020, an outbreak of COVID-19 on cruise ship Diamond Princess was reported with 10 initial cases, following an index case on board around 21-25th January.\n\n By 4th February, public health measures such as removal and isolation of ill passengers and quarantine of non-ill passengers were implemented.\n\n By 20th February, 619 of 3700 passengers and crew (17%) were tested positive.\n\n\nMethods\nWe estimated the basic reproduction number from the initial period of the outbreak using SEIR models.\n\n We calibrated the models with transient functions of countermeasures to incidence data.\n\n We additionally estimated a counterfactual scenario in absence of countermeasures, and established a model stratified by crew and guests to study the impact of differential contact rates among the groups.\n\n We also compared scenarios of an earlier versus later evacuation of the ship.\n\n\nResults\nThe basic reproduction rate was initially 4 times higher

be asymptomatic or cause mild influenza-like illness.\n Therefore, the prevalence of MERS-CoV infections in the general population could be underestimated, which necessitates active surveillance to determine the epidemiological importance of asymptomatic cases.\n The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of various serological assays and to estimate the seroprevalence of anti-MERS-CoV antibodies in high- and low-risk groups in Qatar.\n A total of 4858 samples were screened, including 4719 samples collected from healthy blood donors (BD) over a period of five years (2012-2016), 135 samples from baseline case contacts (CC) collected from individuals in close contact with three positive PCR-confirmed patients (CP), and four samples from MERS-CoV CP.\n Initial screening using anti-MERS-CoV IgG (IgG rS1-ELISA kit) revealed ten reactive samples from BD (10/4719, 0.21%), one from CC (1/135, 0.74%), and three from CP (3/4, 75%).\n Samples from CP but not from BD were also reactive by whole-virus anti-MERS-CoV IgG (n = 3/4) and IgM (n = 1/4) indirect immunefluorescent tests (IIFT) and pseudoparticle neutralization test (ppNT).\n The reactive sample from CC was also confirmed by ppNT.\n Surprisingly, one out of thirteen (7.7%) randomly selected IgG rS1-ELISA-negative BD samples from the initial screening was reactive by the IgM-IIFT (but not by the IgG-IIFT) and was subsequently confirmed by ppNT.\n All IgG rS1-ELISA-reactive samples from BD exhibited considerable reactivity to the four circulating human coronaviruses (HKU1, OC43, 229E, and NL63).\n Cross-reactivity with SARS was only reported for samples from CP using IgG and IgM-IIFT.\n In conclusion, we report a low prevalence of anti-MERS antibodies in the general population, which coincides with the low number of all reported cases by the time of our study (2017) in Qatar (n = 21).\n The false-positive results and the observed cross-reactivity between MERS-CoV and other circulating human

Parenteral TB Vaccine-Primed Hosts Requires Cognate Antigens and CD4 T Cells","abstract":"Tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM) are critical to host defense at mucosal tissue sites.\n However, the parenteral route of immunization as the most commonly used immunization route in practice is not effective in inducing mucosal TRM cells particularly in the lung.\n While various respiratory mucosal (RM)-pull strategies are exploited to mobilize parenteral vaccine-primed T cells into the lung, whether such RM-pull strategies can all or differentially induce Ag-specific TRM cells in the lung remains unclear.\n Here, we have addressed this issue by using a parenteral TB vaccine-primed and RM-pull model.\n We show that both Ag-independent and Ag-dependent RM-pull strategies are able to mobilize Ag-specific CD8 T cells into the lung.\n However, only the RM-pull strategy with cognate antigens can induce robust Ag-specific CD8 TRM cells in the lung.\n We also show that the cognate Ag-based RM-pull strategy is the most effective in inducing TRM cells when carried out during the memory phase, as opposed to the effector phase, of T cell responses to parenteral prime vaccination.\n We further find that cognate Ag-induced CD4 T cells play an important role in the development of CD8 TRM cells in the lung.\n Our study holds implications in developing effective vaccine strategies against respiratory pathogens.\n","id":"PMC6747041","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Frontiers Media

7.82% were HKU1. The month distribution showed that totally HCoV was prevalent in winter, but differences existed in different species.\n The 5 year distribution of HCoV showed a peak-valley distribution trend, with the detection rate higher in 2011 and 2013 whereas lower in 2010, 2012 and 2014. The age distribution revealed that children (especially those &lt;3 years old) and old people (&gt;50 years) were both high risk groups to be infected by HCoV.\n Of the 294 HCoV positive patients,

A multiplex reverse transcription real?time polymerase chain reaction assay was used to detect hBoV; hCoV?OC43, hCoV?229E, hCoV?NL63, and hCoV?HKU1; and Washington University hPyV (hPyV?WU) and Karolinska Insitute hPyV (hPyV?KI), in respiratory tract specimens collected from patients with SARI.\n\n All respiratory specimens from patients enrolled through SARI surveillance were also routinely tested by multiplex reverse transcription real?time polymerase chain reaction for adenovirus; enterovirus; human metapneumovirus; parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, and 3; respiratory syncytial virus; rhinovirus; influenza A, and influenza B.\n\n\nResults\nHuman bocavirus, hCoV?229E, and hPyV?WU were detected in 3.7% (25/680), 4.1% (28/680), and 4.1% (28/680) of respiratory specimens, respectively.\n\n All other viruses were detected in &lt;2% of specimens.\n\n Rhinovirus was the most common coinfecting virus (21.4%?60.7%), followed by adenovirus (21.4%?39.3%), and respiratory syncytial virus (10.7%?24.0%).\n\n Testing for the additional viruses (hBoV, hCoV, and hPyV) decreased the number of specimens that initially tested negative by 2.9% (20/680).\n\n\nConclusion\nInclusion of laboratory tests for hBoV, hCoV?229E, and hPyV?WU in differential testing algorithms for surveillance and diagnostics for suspected cases of respiratory illness of unknown cause may improve our understanding of the etiology of SARI, especially in a country like South Africa with a high number of immune compromised

Polyomaviruses and Four Coronaviruses in HIV-Infected and HIV-Uninfected South African Children","abstract":"Background\nAdvances in molecular diagnostics have implicated newly-discovered respiratory viruses in the pathogenesis of pneumonia.\n\n We aimed to determine the prevalence and clinical characteristics of human bocavirus (hBoV), human rhinovirus (hRV), polyomavirus-WU (WUPyV) and –KI (KIPyV) and human coronaviruses (CoV)-OC43, -NL63, -HKU1 and -229E among children hospitalized with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI).\n\n\nMethods\nMultiplex real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was undertaken on archived nasopharyngeal aspirates from HIV-infected and –uninfected children (&lt;2 years age) hospitalized for LRTI, who had been previously investigated for respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza I–III, adenovirus and influenza A/B.\n\n\nResults\nAt least one of these viruses were identified in 274 (53.0%) of 517 and in 509 (54.0%) of 943 LRTI-episodes in HIV-infected and -uninfected children, respectively.\n\n Human rhinovirus was the most prevalent in HIV-infected (31.7%) and –uninfected children (32.0%), followed by CoV-OC43 (12.2%) and hBoV (9.5%) in HIV-infected; and by hBoV (13.3%) and WUPyV (11.9%) in HIV-uninfected children.\n\n Polyomavirus-KI (8.9% vs.\n\n 4.8%; p?=?0.002) and CoV-OC43 (12.2% vs.\n\n 3.6%; p&lt;0.001) were more prevalent in HIV-infected than –uninfected children.\n\n Combined with previously-tested viruses, respiratory viruses were identified in 60.9% of HIV-infected and 78.3% of HIV-uninfected children.\n\n The newly tested viruses were detected at high frequency in association with other respiratory viruses, including previously-investigated viruses (22.8% in HIV-infected and 28.5% in HIV–uninfected children).\n\n\nConclusions\nWe established that combined with previously-investigated viruses, at least one respiratory virus was identified in the majority of HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected children hospitalized for LRTI.\n\n The high frequency of viral co-infections illustrates the complexities in attributing causality to specific viruses in the aetiology of LRTI and may indicate a synergetic role of viral co-infections in the pathogenesis of childhood LRTI.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3911925","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

long-term care, Republic of Korea (hereafter South Korea) has recorded significant changes in places of death (e.\n\ng.\n\n, hospital, home), especially among older adults.\n\n Over the last few decades, the most common places of death in South Korea were hospitals.\n\n However, Koreans, especially older adults, reportedly prefer to receive terminal care and eventually die at home.\n\n This study was conducted to investigate trends in places of death among older Korean adults and factors associated therewith.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>Data were obtained from the Korean Death Registration Database maintained by the National Statistical Office.\n\n Decedents who died after the age of 65 years from 2001 to 2014 were included in the analysis.\n\n For descriptive analysis, proportions of places of death were analyzed and were used to plot graphs for visualizing trends during 13-year period.\n\n Logistic regression model was used to evaluate factors associated with places of death (hospital versus home).\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>Two million three hundred fifty eight thousand two hundred eleven older adult decedents were included in final analysis.\n\n Hospitals were the most common places of death (57.82%), followed by homes (32.12%).\n\n Dying at social welfare facilities was rare (2.61%).\n\n A gradual increase in hospital deaths (31.38% in 2001 to 75.30% in 2014) and a subsequent decrease in home deaths (60.44% to 15.95% over the same period) were noted.\n\n Hospital deaths were more likely for younger patients (ORs 1.28, 95% CI 1.27-1.29), females (ORs 1.28, 95% CI 1.27-1.29), and single/divorced or widowed individuals (ORs 1.77, 1.49 and 1.03 respectively).\n\n A higher education level and living in urban areas were strongly associated with a higher likelihood of dying in a hospital.\n\n\nConclusion\nid='Par4'>Over the study period, there was a consistent increasing trend in hospital deaths in South Korea.\n\n Trends in place of death and factors associated therewith should be more intensely investigated and monitored.\n\n Resources and facilities should be increased to fulfill end-of-life care preferences and the needs of an increasingly older

associated factors could support the design and implementation of policies and practices to enable dying at home.\n\n This study aims to identify factors associated with the place of death in Singapore, a country with a strong sense of filial piety.\n\n\nSettings/participants\nA retrospective cohort of 62,951 individuals (?21 years old) who had died from chronic diseases in Singapore between 2012–2015 was obtained.\n\n Home death was defined as a death that occurred in a private residence whereas non-home deaths occurred in hospitals, nursing homes, hospices and other locations.\n\n Data were obtained by extracting and linking data from five different databases.\n\n Hierarchical multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine the effects of individual, clinical and system factors sequentially.\n\n\nResults\nTwenty-eight percent of deaths occurred at home.\n\n Factors associated with home death included being 85 years old or older (OR 4.45, 95% CI 3.55–5.59), being female (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.16–1.25), and belonging to Malay ethnicity (OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.82–2.01).\n\n Compared to malignant neoplasm, deaths as a result of diabetes mellitus (OR 1.93, 95% CI 1.69–2.20), and cerebrovascular diseases (OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.19–1.36) were also associated with a higher likelihood of home death.\n\n Independently, receiving home palliative care (OR 3.45, 95% CI 3.26–3.66) and having a documented home death preference (OR 5.08, 95% CI 3.96–6.51) raised the odds of home deaths but being admitted to acute hospitals near the end-of-life was associated with lower odds (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.90–0.94).\n\n\nConclusion\nAside from cultural and clinical factors, system-based factors including access to home palliative care and discussion and documentation of preferences were found to influence the likelihood of home deaths.\n\n Increasing home palliative care capacity and promoting advance care planning could facilitate home deaths if this is the desired option of patients.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6472886","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Woan

In our experience, WhatsApp turned out to be adequate to give a rapid answer to most queries from patients with cancer in the COVID-19 pandemic scenario.\nINTRODUCTION\nTo date, patients with cancer and their treating physicians have been facing the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (COVID-19) outbreak that has spread worldwide from the province of Hubei in China. Person-to-person infection mainly occurs through respiratory droplets, especially if an infected individual coughs or sneezes; however, recent evidence suggests that asymptomatic individuals probably account for most of the spread of contagions. The basic reproduction number of COVID-19 is in the range of 3-5, but its transmissibility varies according to the outbreak phases and the efficacy, if any, of the control measures adopted to contain its spread. The COVID-19 infection usually causes a mild disease that resembles the common cold or influenza, including conjunctivitis and GI symptoms such as diarrhea and nausea/vomiting. Still, a significant percentage of infected people may develop severe acute respiratory distress or multi-organ dysfunction, which may be fatal in 2%-8% of patients, depending on population characteristics. Severe complications from COVID-19 have been supposedly linked to the significant presence of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ie, the virus receptor) in various human organs.\nCONTEXT\nKey Objective\nAre instant messaging systems useful to oncologists to care for patients with cancer and to mitigate their anxieties and fears during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (COVID-19) outbreak?\nKnowledge Generated\nThe WhatsApp instant messaging system is a useful and rapid tool to inform and reassure patients with cancer and to facilitate patient triage in a real-word setting of the pandemic spread of COVID-19.\nRelevance\nMedical counseling is needed even more than usual to protect patients with cancer and to identify those who require prompt, critical treatment. Health care professionals believe that instant messaging systems are useful tools for the multidisciplinary management of patients with cancer in daily practice.\nA recent scientific article on the China outbreak reported that COVID-19-related fatal disease has been more frequently recorded in older patients with severe comorbidities, even though death may also occur in younger, healthy individuals. In the past weeks, a sudden and sharp increase in patient queries about COVID-19 has been registered in all fields of medicine. Although severe restrictions, such as city lockdowns and quarantines, have been put in place in various countries to contain viral diffusion as much as possible, COVID-19 infections continue to spread rapidly worldwide. The media-related rebound is causing widespread confusion, if not panic, among patients with cancer, survivors, and their families, all of whom feel that they may be particularly prone to infectious diseases. Possible immunosuppression in patients with cancer is a well-known concern for oncologists, especially if patients have recently received immunotherapy agents. Liang et al and Wang et al published brief reports on patients with cancer infected with COVID-19. Both showed that a higher risk of death exists in patients with cancer, especially those with lung cancer, compared to patients without cancer and that older age is associated with higher risk. Therefore, medical counseling is needed even more than usual to protect patients with cancer and to identify those who require prompt, critical treatment.\nGenerally speaking, most oncologists have not been fully prepared to face the pandemic spread of the viral infection, which may require significant communication skills beyond behavioral and medical guideline recommendations to manage patients. Many patients have used social media tools to ask about their doubts and fears. In this article, we report real-world data and a descriptive analysis of patients' needs and fears as well as of misinformation obtained through the WhatsApp instant messaging system (WM; Facebook, Menlo Park, CA) in daily practice during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nA sharp increase in spontaneous queries about COVID-19 risk of infection has been registered in the past 4 weeks among patients with cancer treated or followed at three oncological institutions in Sicily, Italy. In Italy, the COVID-19 outbreak began in the northern part of the country, but over the past 3 weeks, the infection has spread toward the southern areas, which are preparing to face a wider diffusion of the virus.\nQueries were collected through the chat text export tool on WM, which is available for most patients treated or followed up at the participating institutions. The three oncologists involved in this data collection were already experienced in using the WM tool in a urological medical setting. Patients were informed on the possible use of their conversations for statistical and/or medical reasons and that these conversations may be inserted into their medical records. According to Italian regulations on retrospective studies, this observational, noninterventional study was electronically notified for approval by the ethics committee of the University of Palermo and was carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Privacy was strictly protected during the procedure by replacing each username with a unique code.\nThe observation period lasted from March 8 to 22. All WM queries included in the analysis were spontaneously sent by patients or their caregivers and not elicited by their oncologists. These conversations also contained the communication that the oncologists had sent in response to each of their patients and their reactions to the recommendations recently given by the Italian Association of Medical Oncology as reported in the Data Supplement. All oncologists have promptly taken these actions with respect to guidelines and ordinances already released at the direction of the involved medical institutions and the Italian government guidelines, which for some aspects refer to the recommendations released by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The demographic and clinical characteristics of patients who sent queries were anonymously collected and analyzed. Queries were also analyzed according to age, sex, type of cancer, active treatment (yes v none), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (0-1 v 2), and stage (metastatic v none). Time to response by health care personnel to patient queries as well as the number of queries per patient were obtained. Triage of patients to be admitted to the participating hospitals required evaluation of travel history in the past 4 weeks (with particular attention paid to those coming from high-contagion areas), absence of fever &gt; 100.4 F or 38 C, coughing, and/or shortness of breath. In case of suspicion, patients were subjected to COVID-19 swab and put in quarantine and monitored. To better understand how patients talk and feel about this potential critical health topic, we also applied to the data set a sentiment analysis of the messages that have been classified by positive emotions (anticipation, trust, and joy) and negative emotions (disgust, fear, and sadness). The analysis was performed using R version 3.6.3 with the package syuzhet. The NRC Word-Emotion Association Lexicon, which contains 10,170 lexical items that are coded for Plutchik's basic human emotions and implemented in the R syuzhet package, associates an emotion (or more than one emotion) to each of the 10,170 lexical items. Given a word and emotion X, the NRC Word-Emotion Association Lexicon associates a score (range, 0-1) with it. A score of 1 indicates that the word conveys the highest amount of emotion X. A score of 0 indicates that the word conveys the lowest amount of emotion X.\nDescriptive statistics are reported as absolute numbers of patients, and their relative percentages are adjusted to the nearest unit. The chi2 test was applied to a contingency table for statistical analysis.\nRESULTS\nOverall, 446 WM-based conversations corresponding to 446 patients were received and considered for the analysis. Table 1 lists the main clinical and demographic characteristics of patients with the most frequent neoplasms included in this analysis. Most of the queries came from patients with the most incident neoplasms, including breast (33%), lung (14%), colorectal (21%), and prostate (9%) cancer, while those from patients with GI stromal tumor (GIST; 1%), sarcoma (2%), head/neck cancer (2%), and gastric cancer (3%) were those less frequently registered. Patients with pancreatic, ovarian/uterine, and CNS tumors represented 6%, 5%, and 4% of cases, respectively. Patients with renal cell carcinoma were not included in the analysis because they were already contacted by phone during the data collection period. Table 2 lists patient queries as grouped by homology and divided into five categories: Can I postpone my control visit or examinations (37% of queries)? Should I continue my anticancer therapy (29% of queries)? Am I an immunosuppressed person (16% of queries)? Should I change my diet or make other lifestyle changes (16% of queries)? Are there any limits on what I can do (25% of queries)?\nPatient Demographic and Clinical Characteristics\nQueries From Patients With Cancer, Recommendations Given by Treating Oncologists, and Actions Taken\nFigures 1 and 2 show the number of patients who spontaneously required a delay in programmed visits or treatments according to primary disease and the number of patients effectively delayed by their treating oncologists. The difference between groups is statistically significant (P &lt; .001). Overall, 198 follow-up visits were delayed after patients' queries or independent oncologist suggestions. The ma-jority of delays were in patients with breast, colon, or prostate cancer with programmed follow-up visits, which were postponed for at least 2 months pending epidemic trend and additional possible new countermeasures. Queries about postponing and/or possibly discontinuing anticancer treatments were mostly from patients undergoing chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy and in a smaller proportion of patients taking oral drugs, such as oral chemotherapy with capecitabine or trifluridine and tipiracil for colon cancer; tyrosine kinase inhibitors for mutated lung adenocarcinoma; imatinib for GIST; poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors for BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer; or hormonal agents, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, or oral chemotherapy with capecitabine, vinorelbine, or cyclophosphamide for hormone receptor breast carcinoma. Five patients asked for a delay in adjuvant radiotherapy. No statistical difference was recorded when data were analyzed for sex, type of primary disease, and stage (metastatic v not advanced in an adjuvant setting). A statistically significant association was observed between queries for delays or withdrawals and age &gt; 75 years (P &lt; .0007) and ECOG performance status of 2 (P &lt; .0001).\nType of cancer, patient queries for visit delay and/or treatment withdrawal, and treatment withdrawals by physicians.

ECOG PS, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status.\nTable 2 also lists answers given by treating oncologists and additional actions taken. Briefly, follow-up visits of patients without active chemotherapeutic, biological, or immunological treatments were postponed by at least 2 months in the absence of symptoms or other clinical data suspicious for progressive disease as possibly detected at telephone triage and depending on epidemic trend. Patients who were undergoing the aforementioned cancer treatments were invited to come regularly to the hospital for a checkup in the absence of self-checked fever or other signs of infection. Telephone triage was carried out for all patients expected for infusion, and no relatives were allowed to enter the infusion rooms. Body temperature was recorded before entry into the infusion area. Only if necessary, patients were allowed to be accompanied by a single caregiver who was required to wear a mask and disposable gloves. Appointments were scheduled with a 15-minute interval between visits to avoid contact between patients as much as possible. Patients who required counseling about lifestyle and/or immunosuppression were informed that there is no readily available test to check one's level of immunosuppression but that being in active chemotherapy, having low WBC or low lymphocyte counts, and/or taking immunosuppressive agents are all associated with immunosuppression and an increased risk of infection. Therefore, extra caution was recommended in following physicians' suggestions and government ordinances.\nFigure 3 shows the emotion distribution detected. By examining the raw data and the results of sentiment analysis, we see that the intensity of the scores related to the emotions evaluated is greater for the negative ones. The number of patients who reported negative emotion was higher than those who showed positive emotions (57% v 43%). Fear, anger, and sadness were dominant, while trust is represented by at least half of the data set.\nDistribution of emotion categories.\nDISCUSSION\nAfter the diffusion of COVID-19 in Italy, the current social scenario is a nationwide lockdown except for hospitals, pharmacies, and food supplies. The modality of transmission observed in China and Northern Italy has raised considerable fear among the whole population and mostly in patients with cancer as a consequence of the risks linked to potential cancer- and/or treatment-related immunosuppression. The best way of counteracting uncontrolled fears while protecting patients and their families is to provide adequate information. In this scenario dominated by uncertainty and empiricism, the need for data relative to patients with cancer and COVID-19 infection is urgently needed.\nIn this study, we collected, categorized, and analyzed WM queries on various doubts, fears, and needs from 446 real-world patients that were received in only 2 weeks. Although some aspects could not have been explored because of the nature of the study, such as the psychological and economic effects of lockdown and/or quarantine, WM gave useful answers required by many, if not most, patients about several issues, which we categorized by homology for practical purposes. As expected, most of the queries came from patients affected by the most incident and prevalent tumors (ie, breast, prostate, colon, and lung cancer). No association was seen between the type of queries and patient characteristics such as sex, type of disease, and stage of the disease. On the other hand, frequency of queries with regard to delays showed a statistically significant association with older age (&gt;= 75 years) and poor performance status, which demonstrates that more fragile patients and their families are the most worried. A small, but significant (at least in our opinion) percentage of patients asked for in-progress treatment withdrawal, which showed more fear of possible COVID-19 contagion than progressive cancer. Answers to these latter queries required an accurate evaluation of the single patient. Despite these mostly empirical efforts, more data are eagerly needed to fill the enormous quantity of doubts, as recently stated by others.\nTo our knowledge, reports about the use of WM in any oncological setting are almost entirely occasional in the medical literature, although it has been reported to be widely used mainly because of physicians' perception of advantages. Maugdal et al reported the successful use of a WM counseling program in a group of women with breast cancer to share their personal experiences, which rendered these patients active in the management of their disease. Nayak et al showed WM to be a more effective tool for providing dental education on tobacco and oral cancer compared with conventional audio visual aids. Our group, which is composed of urologists, medical oncologists, radiologists, and radiotherapists, reported the use of WM as a tool for the multidisciplinary management of patients with prostate cancer in daily practice. A diagnostic and therapeutic agreement was reached in approximately 82% of cases, and these data were shared with patients. Physician satisfaction was measured by using a questionnaire that reported an average satisfaction score of 7.8 on a 0-10 scale. Other authors have reported the use of WM and other applications in endoscopic ultrasound-fine needle aspiration of pancreatic lesions, in self-monitoring of melanoma, and in chemotherapy monitoring. This study also explored emotional expressiveness for eight specific types of emotions and identified those particularly expressed through the textual messages of patients with cancer examined in the sample. The intensity of the scores related to the emotions evaluated is greater for the negative ones. Fear, anger, and sadness were dominant, while trust was reported by at least half of the data set. This seems to indicate how strong the emotional impact is in patients with cancer, as already pointed out by other authors.\nA limitation of the study is that the sample collected was not intended to be representative or a complete set of all the questions asked by patients with cancer during the period under review. The results cannot be considered to reflect all topics of the conversations the patients had with the oncologists involved. In addition, the results of this analysis represent a snapshot of a peculiar time period and have no evaluation comparison back and forth in time.\nIn conclusion, WM resulted in a useful and rapid tool to inform and reassure patients with cancer and to facilitate patient triage in a real-word setting of the COVID-19 pandemic. Improved and more secure tools are likely to represent a potent way of managing patients with cancer in the near future.\nSUPPORT\nSupported in part by an unrestricted grant from the GSTU Foundation and the Risk Management Unit, Policlinic &quot;P.

characterisation and epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020.

11,900 laboratory-confirmed human infections, including 259 deaths, posing a serious threat to human health.\n Currently, however, there is no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine.\n Considering the relatively high identity of receptor-binding domain (RBD) in 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, it is urgent to assess the cross-reactivity of anti-SARS CoV antibodies with 2019-nCoV spike protein, which could have important implications for rapid development of vaccines and therapeutic antibodies against 2019-nCoV.\n Here, we report for the first time that a SARS-CoV-specific human monoclonal

some of the most potent SARS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies (e.\ng.\n m396, CR3014) that target the ACE2 binding site of SARS-CoV failed to bind 2019-nCoV spike protein, implying that the

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days

Period","abstract":"Background\nAmericans increasingly post and consult online physician rankings, yet we know little about this new phenomenon of public physician quality reporting.\n\n Physicians worry these rankings will become an outlet for disgruntled patients.\n\n\nObjective\nTo describe trends in patients’ online ratings over time, across specialties, to identify what physician characteristics influence online ratings, and to examine how the value of ratings reflects physician quality.\n\n\nMethods\nWe used data from RateMDs.\n\ncom, which included over 386,000 national ratings from 2005 to 2010 and provided insight into the evolution of patients’ online ratings.\n\n We obtained physician demographic data from the US Department of Health and Human Services’ Area Resource File.\n\n Finally, we matched patients’ ratings with physician-level data from the Virginia Medical Board and examined the probability of being rated and resultant rating levels.\n\n\nResults\nWe estimate that 1 in 6 practicing US physicians received an online review by January 2010. Obstetrician/gynecologists were twice as likely to be rated (P &lt; .\n\n001) as other physicians.\n\n Online reviews were generally quite positive (mean 3.93 on a scale of 1 to 5).\n\n Based on the Virginia physician population, long-time graduates were more likely to be rated, while physicians who graduated in recent years received higher average ratings (P &lt; .\n\n001).\n\n Patients gave slightly higher ratings to board-certified physicians (P = .\n\n04), those who graduated from highly rated medical schools (P = .\n\n002), and those without malpractice claims (P = .\n\n1).\n\n\nConclusion\nOnline physician rating is rapidly growing in popularity and becoming commonplace with no evidence that they are dominated by disgruntled patients.\n\n There exist statistically significant correlations between the value of ratings and physician experience, board certification, education, and malpractice claims, suggesting a positive correlation between online ratings and physician quality.\n\n However, the magnitude is small.\n\n The average number of ratings per physician is still low, and most rating variation reflects evaluations of punctuality and staff.\n\n Understanding whether they truly reflect better care and how they are used will be critically important.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3374528","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Gunther

Internet: Usage and Associations With Conventional Measures of Quality in the English National Health Service","abstract":"Background\nPatients are increasingly rating their family physicians on the Internet in the same way as they might rate a hotel on TripAdvisor or a seller on eBay, despite physicians’ concerns about this process.\n\n\nObjective\nThis study aims to examine the usage of NHS Choices, a government website that encourages patients to rate the quality of family practices in England, and associations between web-based patient ratings and conventional measures of patient experience and clinical quality in primary care.\n\n\nMethods\nWe obtained all (16,952) ratings of family practices posted on NHS Choices between October 2009 and December 2010. We examined associations between patient ratings and family practice and population characteristics.\n\n Associations between ratings and survey measures of patient experience and clinical outcomes were examined.\n\n\nResults\n61% of the 8089 family practices in England were rated, and 69% of ratings would recommend their family practice.\n\n Practices serving younger, less deprived, and more densely populated areas were more likely to be rated.\n\n There were moderate associations with survey measures of patient experience (Spearman ? 0.37?0.48, P&lt;.\n\n001 for all 5 variables), but only weak associations with measures of clinical process and outcome (Spearman ? less than ±0.18, P&lt;.\n\n001 for 6 of 7 variables).\n\n\nConclusion\nThe frequency of patients rating their family physicians on the Internet is variable in England, but the ratings are generally positive and are moderately associated with other measures of patient experience and weakly associated with clinical quality.\n\n Although potentially flawed, patient ratings on the Internet may provide an opportunity for organizational learning and, as it becomes more common, another lens to look at the quality of primary care.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3517341","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Gunther Eysenbach","authors":[{"firstname":"Gunther","surname":"Eysenbach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guodong","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guodong","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jeffrey","surname":"Segal","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Corinna","surname":"Schaefer","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Felix","surname":"Greaves","email":"felixgreaves@gmail.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Felix","surname":"Greaves","email":"felixgreaves@gmail.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Utz J","surname":"Pape","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Henry","surname":"Lee","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Dianna M","surname":"Smith","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ara","surname":"Darzi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Azeem","surname":"Majeed","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Christopher","surname":"Millett","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Sentiment analysis and opinion mining","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Statistical comparisons of classifiers over multiple data sets","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"WordNet affect: an affective extension of WordNet","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"SentiWordNet 3.0.
