A previously unknown betacoronavirus was discovered through the use of unbiased sequencing in samples from patients with pneumonia. Human airway epithelial cells were used to isolate a novel coronavirus, named 2019-nCoV, which formed a clade within the subgenus sarbecovirus, Orthocoronavirinae subfamily. Different from both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, 2019-nCoV is the seventh member of the family of coronaviruses that infect humans. Enhanced surveillance and further investigation are ongoing. (Funded by the National Key Research and Development Program of China and the National Major Project for Control and Prevention of Infectious Disease in China.)\nEmerging and reemerging pathogens are global challenges for public health. Coronaviruses are enveloped RNA viruses that are distributed broadly among humans, other mammals, and birds and that cause respiratory, enteric, hepatic, and neurologic diseases. Six coronavirus species are known to cause human disease. Four viruses : 229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1 : are prevalent and typically cause common cold symptoms in immunocompetent individuals. The two other strains : severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) : are zoonotic in origin and have been linked to sometimes fatal illness. SARS-CoV was the causal agent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreaks in 2002 and 2003 in Guangdong Province, China. MERS-CoV was the pathogen responsible for severe respiratory disease outbreaks in 2012 in the Middle East. Given the high prevalence and wide distribution of coronaviruses, the large genetic diversity and frequent recombination of their genomes, and increasing human-animal interface activities, novel coronaviruses are likely to emerge periodically in humans owing to frequent cross-species infections and occasional spillover events.\nIn late December 2019, several local health facilities reported clusters of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause that were epidemiologically linked to a seafood and wet animal wholesale market in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. On December 31, 2019, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) dispatched a rapid response team to accompany Hubei provincial and Wuhan city health authorities and to conduct an epidemiologic and etiologic investigation. We report the results of this investigation, identifying the source of the pneumonia clusters, and describe a novel coronavirus detected in patients with pneumonia whose specimens were tested by the China CDC at an early stage of the outbreak. We also describe clinical features of the pneumonia in two of these patients.\nMethods\nViral Diagnostic Methods\nFour lower respiratory tract samples, including bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid, were collected from patients with pneumonia of unknown cause who were identified in Wuhan on December 21, 2019, or later and who had been present at the Huanan Seafood Market close to the time of their clinical presentation. Seven bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid specimens were collected from patients in Beijing hospitals with pneumonia of known cause to serve as control samples. Extraction of nucleic acids from clinical samples (including uninfected cultures that served as negative controls) was performed with a High Pure Viral Nucleic Acid Kit, as described by the manufacturer (Roche). Extracted nucleic acid samples were tested for viruses and bacteria by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), using the RespiFinderSmart22kit (PathoFinder BV) and the LightCycler 480 real-time PCR system, in accordance with manufacturer instructions. Samples were analyzed for 22 pathogens (18 viruses and 4 bacteria) as detailed in the Supplementary Appendix. In addition, unbiased, high-throughput sequencing, described previously, was used to discover microbial sequences not identifiable by the means described above. A real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) assay was used to detect viral RNA by targeting a consensus RdRp region of pan beta-CoV, as described in the Supplementary Appendix.\nIsolation of Virus\nBronchoalveolar-lavage fluid samples were collected in sterile cups to which virus transport medium was added. Samples were then centrifuged to remove cellular debris. The supernatant was inoculated on human airway epithelial cells, which had been obtained from airway specimens resected from patients undergoing surgery for lung cancer and were confirmed to be special-pathogen-free by NGS.\nHuman airway epithelial cells were expanded on plastic substrate to generate passage-1 cells and were subsequently plated at a density of 2.5x105 cells per well on permeable Transwell-COL (12-mm diameter) supports. Human airway epithelial cell cultures were generated in an air-liquid interface for 4 to 6 weeks to form well-differentiated, polarized cultures resembling in vivo pseudostratified mucociliary epithelium.\nPrior to infection, apical surfaces of the human airway epithelial cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline; 150 mul of supernatant from bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid samples was inoculated onto the apical surface of the cell cultures. After a 2-hour incubation at 37 C, unbound virus was removed by washing with 500 mul of phosphate-buffered saline for 10 minutes; human airway epithelial cells were maintained in an air-liquid interface incubated at 37 C with 5% carbon dioxide. Every 48 hours, 150 mul of phosphate-buffered saline was applied to the apical surfaces of the human airway epithelial cells, and after 10 minutes of incubation at 37 C the samples were harvested. Pseudostratified mucociliary epithelium cells were maintained in this environment; apical samples were passaged in a 1:3 diluted vial stock to new cells. The cells were monitored daily with light microscopy, for cytopathic effects, and with RT-PCR, for the presence of viral nucleic acid in the supernatant. After three passages, apical samples and human airway epithelial cells were prepared for transmission electron microscopy.\nTransmission Electron Microscopy\nSupernatant from human airway epithelial cell cultures that showed cytopathic effects was collected, inactivated with 2% paraformaldehyde for at least 2 hours, and ultracentrifuged to sediment virus particles. The enriched supernatant was negatively stained on film-coated grids for examination. Human airway epithelial cells showing cytopathic effects were collected and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde-2.5% glutaraldehyde and were then fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide dehydrated with grade ethanol embedded with PON812 resin. Sections (80 nm) were cut from resin block and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, separately. The negative stained grids and ultrathin sections were observed under transmission electron microscopy.\nViral Genome Sequencing\nRNA extracted from bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid and culture supernatants was used as a template to clone and sequence the genome. We used a combination of Illumina sequencing and nanopore sequencing to characterize the virus genome. Sequence reads were assembled into contig maps (a set of overlapping DNA segments) with the use of CLC Genomics software, version 4.6.1 (CLC Bio). Specific primers were subsequently designed for PCR, and 5'- or 3'-RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) was used to fill genome gaps from conventional Sanger sequencing. These PCR products were purified from gels and sequenced with a BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit and a 3130XL Genetic Analyzer, in accordance with the manufacturers' instructions.\nMultiple-sequence alignment of the 2019-nCoV and reference sequences was performed with the use of Muscle. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete genomes was performed with RAxML (13) with 1000 bootstrap replicates and a general time-reversible model used as the nucleotide substitution model.\nResults\nPatients\nThree adult patients presented with severe pneumonia and were admitted to a hospital in Wuhan on December 27, 2019. Patient 1 was a 49-year-old woman, Patient 2 was a 61-year-old man, and Patient 3 was a 32-year-old man. Clinical profiles were available for Patients 1 and 2. Patient 1 reported having no underlying chronic medical conditions but reported fever (temperature, 37 C to 38 C) and cough with chest discomfort on December 23, 2019. Four days after the onset of illness, her cough and chest discomfort worsened, but the fever was reduced; a diagnosis of pneumonia was based on computed tomographic (CT) scan. Her occupation was retailer in the seafood wholesale market. Patient 2 initially reported fever and cough on December 20, 2019; respiratory distress developed 7 days after the onset of illness and worsened over the next 2 days (see chest radiographs, Figure 1), at which time mechanical ventilation was started. He had been a frequent visitor to the seafood wholesale market. Patients 1 and 3 recovered and were discharged from the hospital on January 16, 2020. Patient 2 died on January 9, 2020. No biopsy specimens were obtained.\nDetection and Isolation of a Novel Coronavirus\nThree bronchoalveolar-lavage samples were collected from Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital on December 30, 2019. No specific pathogens (including HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1) were detected in clinical specimens from these patients by the RespiFinderSmart22kit. RNA extracted from bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid from the patients was used as a template to clone and sequence a genome using a combination of Illumina sequencing and nanopore sequencing. More than 20,000 viral reads from individual specimens were obtained, and most contigs matched to the genome from lineage B of the genus betacoronavirus : showing more than 85% identity with a bat SARS-like CoV (bat-SL-CoVZC45, MG772933.1) genome published previously. Positive results were also obtained with use of a real-time RT-PCR assay for RNA targeting to a consensus RdRp region of pan beta-CoV (although the cycle threshold value was higher than 34 for detected samples). Virus isolation from the clinical specimens was performed with human airway epithelial cells and Vero E6 and Huh-7 cell lines. The isolated virus was named 2019-nCoV.\nTo determine whether virus particles could be visualized in 2019-nCoV-infected human airway epithelial cells, mock-infected and 2019-nCoV-infected human airway epithelial cultures were examined with light microscopy daily and with transmission electron microscopy 6 days after inoculation. Cytopathic effects were observed 96 hours after inoculation on surface layers of human airway epithelial cells; a lack of cilium beating was seen with light microcopy in the center of the focus (Figure 2). No specific cytopathic effects were observed in the Vero E6 and Huh-7 cell lines until 6 days after inoculation.\nElectron micrographs of negative-stained 2019-nCoV particles were generally spherical with some pleomorphism (Figure 3). Diameter varied from about 60 to 140 nm. Virus particles had quite distinctive spikes, about 9 to 12 nm, and gave virions the appearance of a solar corona. Extracellular free virus particles and inclusion bodies filled with virus particles in membrane-bound vesicles in cytoplasm were found in the human airway epithelial ultrathin sections. This observed morphology is consistent with the Coronaviridae family.\nTo further characterize the virus, de novo sequences of 2019-nCoV genome from clinical specimens (bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid) and human airway epithelial cell virus isolates were obtained by Illumina and nanopore sequencing. The novel coronavirus was identified from all three patients. Two nearly full-length coronavirus sequences were obtained from bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid (BetaCoV/Wuhan/IVDC-HB-04/2020, BetaCoV/Wuhan/IVDC-HB-05/2020|EPI_ISL_402121), and one full-length sequence was obtained from a virus isolated from a patient (BetaCoV/Wuhan/IVDC-HB-01/2020|EPI_ISL_402119). Complete genome sequences of the three novel coronaviruses were submitted to GISAID (BetaCoV/Wuhan/IVDC-HB-01/2019, accession ID: EPI_ISL_402119; BetaCoV/Wuhan/IVDC-HB-04/2020, accession ID: EPI_ISL_402120; BetaCoV/Wuhan/IVDC-HB-05/2019, accession ID: EPI_ISL_402121) and have a 86.9% nucleotide sequence identity to a previously published bat SARS-like CoV (bat-SL-CoVZC45, MG772933.1) genome. The three 2019-nCoV genomes clustered together within the sarbecovirus subgenus, which shows the typical betacoronavirus organization: a 5' untranslated region (UTR), replicase complex (orf1ab), S gene, E gene, M gene, N gene, 3' UTR, and several unidentified nonstructural open reading frames.\nAlthough 2019-nCoV is similar to some betacoronaviruses detected in bats (Figure 4), it is distinct from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The three 2019-nCoV coronaviruses from Wuhan, together with two bat-derived SARS-like strains, ZC45 and ZXC21, form a distinct clade. SARS-CoV strains from humans and genetically similar SARS-like coronaviruses from bats collected from southwestern China formed another clade within the subgenus sarbecovirus. Since the sequence identity in conserved replicase domains (ORF 1ab) is less than 90% between 2019-nCoV and other members of betacoronavirus, the 2019-nCoV : the likely causative agent of the viral pneumonia in Wuhan : is a novel betacoronavirus belonging to the sarbecovirus subgenus of Coronaviridae family.\nDiscussion\nWe report a novel CoV (2019-nCoV) that was identified in hospitalized patients in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. Evidence for the presence of this virus includes identification in bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid in three patients by whole-genome sequencing, direct PCR, and culture. The illness likely to have been caused by this CoV was named &quot;novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia&quot; (NCIP). Complete genomes were submitted to GISAID. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV falls into the genus betacoronavirus, which includes coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, bat SARS-like CoV, and others) discovered in humans, bats, and other wild animals. We report isolation of the virus and the initial description of its specific cytopathic effects and morphology.\nMolecular techniques have been used successfully to identify infectious agents for many years. Unbiased, high-throughput sequencing is a powerful tool for the discovery of pathogens. Next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics are changing the way we can respond to infectious disease outbreaks, improving our understanding of disease occurrence and transmission, accelerating the identification of pathogens, and promoting data sharing. We describe in this report the use of molecular techniques and unbiased DNA sequencing to discover a novel betacoronavirus that is likely to have been the cause of severe pneumonia in three patients in Wuhan, China.\nAlthough establishing human airway epithelial cell cultures is labor intensive, they appear to be a valuable research tool for analysis of human respiratory pathogens. Our study showed that initial propagation of human respiratory secretions onto human airway epithelial cell cultures, followed by transmission electron microscopy and whole genome sequencing of culture supernatant, was successfully used for visualization and detection of new human coronavirus that can possibly elude identification by traditional approaches.\nFurther development of accurate and rapid methods to identify unknown respiratory pathogens is still needed. On the basis of analysis of three complete genomes obtained in this study, we designed several specific and sensitive assays targeting ORF1ab, N, and E regions of the 2019-nCoV genome to detect viral RNA in clinical specimens. The primer sets and standard operating procedures have been shared with the World Health Organization and are intended for surveillance and detection of 2019-nCoV infection globally and in China. More recent data show 2019-nCoV detection in 830 persons in China.\nAlthough our study does not fulfill Koch's postulates, our analyses provide evidence implicating 2019-nCoV in the Wuhan outbreak. Additional evidence to confirm the etiologic significance of 2019-nCoV in the Wuhan outbreak include identification of a 2019-nCoV antigen in the lung tissue of patients by immunohistochemical analysis, detection of IgM and IgG antiviral antibodies in the serum samples from a patient at two time points to demonstrate seroconversion, and animal (monkey) experiments to provide evidence of pathogenicity. Of critical importance are epidemiologic investigations to characterize transmission modes, reproduction interval, and clinical spectrum resulting from infection to inform and refine strategies that can prevent, control, and stop the spread of 2019-nCoV.\nThis work was supported by grants from the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFD0500301) and the National Major Project for Control and Prevention of Infectious Disease in China (2018ZX10101002).\nDisclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.\nThis article was published on January 24, 2020, and updated on January 29, 2020, at NEJM.org.\nDisclosure Forms\nSupplementary Appendix\nReferences\nFrom &quot;A&quot;IV to &quot;Z&quot;IKV: attacks from emerging and re-emerging pathogens.\nCoronavirus pathogenesis.\nEpidemiology, genetic recombination, and pathogenesis of coronaviruses.\nOrigin and evolution of pathogenic coronaviruses.\nEpidemiology and cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Guangdong, People's Republic of China, in February, 2003.\nA novel coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome.\nIdentification of a novel coronavirus in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome.\nIsolation of a novel coronavirus from a man with pneumonia in Saudi Arabia.\nMERS, SARS, and Ebola: the role of super-spreaders in infectious disease.\nViral and bacterial etiology of acute febrile respiratory syndrome among patients in Qinghai, China.\nCoronaviruses and the human airway: a universal system for virus-host interaction studies.\nA new arenavirus in a cluster of fatal transplant-associated diseases.\nA novel coronavirus genome identified in a cluster of pneumonia cases : Wuhan, China 2019-2020.\nPathogen genomics in public health.\nChest Radiographs.\nShown are chest radiographs from Patient 2 on days 8 and 11 after the onset of illness.

and macro-vascular health by sensing pathogen/danger signals and secreting vasoactive molecules.\n SARS-CoV-2 infection primarily affects the pulmonary system, but accumulating evidence suggests that it also affects the pan-vasculature in the extrapulmonary systems by directly (via virus infection) or indirectly (via cytokine storm), causing endothelial dysfunction (endotheliitis, endothelialitis

(SARS-CoV-2) killed over a million people, including &gt;25,000 in New York City (NYC) alone.\n The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 highlights clinical needs to detect infection, track strain evolution, and identify biomarkers of disease course.\n To address these challenges, we designed a fast (30-minute) colorimetric test (LAMP) for SARS-CoV-2 infection from naso/oropharyngeal swabs and a large-scale shotgun metatranscriptomics platform (total-RNA-seq) for host, viral, and microbial profiling.\n We applied these methods to clinical specimens gathered from 669 patients in New York City during the first two months of the outbreak, yielding a broad molecular portrait of the emerging COVID-19 disease.\n We find significant enrichment of a NYC-distinctive clade of the virus (20C), as well as host responses in interferon, ACE, hematological, and olfaction pathways.\n In addition, we use 50,821 patient records to find that renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibitors have a protective effect for severe COVID-19 outcomes, unlike similar drugs.\n Finally, spatial transcriptomic data from COVID-19 patient autopsy tissues reveal distinct ACE2 expression loci, with macrophage and neutrophil infiltration in the lungs.\n These findings can inform public health and may help develop and drive SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic, prevention, and treatment

binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood

Unfortunately, there are few tools available to functionally test these viruses for their ability to infect humans, which has severely hampered efforts to predict the next zoonotic viral outbreak.\n Here, we developed an approach to rapidly screen lineage B betacoronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and the recent SARS-CoV-2, for receptor usage and their ability to infect cell types from different species.\n We show that host protease processing during viral entry is a significant barrier for several lineage B viruses and that bypassing this barrier allows several lineage B viruses to enter human cells through an unknown receptor.\n We also demonstrate how different lineage B viruses can recombine to gain entry into human cells, and confirm that human ACE2 is the receptor for the

however, the genetic mechanisms underlying cross-species adaptation remain poorly understood.\n Variation in the host receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), can block the interaction with the MERS-CoV spike protein and form a species barrier to infection.\n To better understand the species adaptability of MERS-CoV, we identified a suboptimal species-derived variant of DPP4 to study viral adaption.\n Passaging virus on cells expressing this DPP4 variant led to accumulation of mutations in the viral spike which increased replication.\n Parallel passages revealed distinct paths of viral adaptation to the same DPP4 variant.\n Structural analysis and functional assays showed that these mutations enhanced viral entry with suboptimal DPP4 by altering the surface charge of spike.\n These findings demonstrate that MERS-CoV spike can utilize multiple paths to rapidly adapt to novel species variation in DPP4.","id":"PMC7104223","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Cell

G\n758 to RRSR?R\n758), which introduces a putative furin-like cleavage (?) site.\n Using a molecular cDNA infectious clone to generate a corresponding recombinant virus, we show for the first time that such point mutation in the HCoV-OC43 S glycoprotein creates a functional cleavage site between the S1 and S2 portions of the S protein.\n While the corresponding recombinant virus retained its neuroinvasive properties, this mutation led to decreased neurovirulence while potentially modifying the mode of virus spread, likely leading to a limited dissemination within the CNS.\n Taken together, these results are consistent with the adaptation of HCoV-OC43 to the CNS environment, resulting from the selection of quasi-species harboring mutations that lead to amino acid changes in viral genes, like the S gene in HCoV-OC43, which may contribute to a more efficient establishment of a less pathogenic but persistent CNS infection.\n This adaptative mechanism could potentially be associated with human encephalitis or other neurological degenerative pathologies.\n","id":"PMC4636366","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Alain","surname":"Le Coupanec","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Marc","surname":"Desforges","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mathieu","surname":"Meessen-Pinard","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mathieu","surname":"Dubé","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Robert","surname":"Day","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nabil G.","surname":"Seidah","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pierre J.","surname":"Talbot","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Matthias Johannes","surname":"Schnell","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Matthias Johannes","surname":"Schnell","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.virol.2012.08.049","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The chemokine receptor CXCR2 and coronavirus-induced neurologic disease","abstract":"Inoculation with the neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) into the central nervous system (CNS) of susceptible strains of mice results in an acute encephalomyelitis in which virus preferentially replicates within glial cells while excluding neurons.\n Control of viral replication during acute disease is mediated by infiltrating virus-specific T cells via cytokine secretion and cytolytic activity, however sterile immunity is not achieved and virus persists resulting in chronic neuroinflammation associated with demyelination.\n CXCR2 is a chemokine receptor that upon binding to specific ligands promotes host defense through recruitment of myeloid cells to the CNS as well as protecting oligodendroglia from cytokine-mediated death in response to MHV infection.\n These findings highlight growing evidence of the diverse and important role of CXCR2 in regulating neuroinflammatory diseases.\n","id":"PMC3522860","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Inc.","authors":[{"firstname":"Jason G.","surname":"Weinger","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Brett S.","surname":"Marro","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Martin P.","surname":"Hosking","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Thomas E.","surname":"Lane","email":"tlane@uci.edu","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/S0168-1702(01)00432-4","date":"2001-11-29","title":"Acute hepatic failure in IFN-?-deficient BALB/c mice after murine coronavirus infection","abstract":"We previously showed that an intraperitoneal infection with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) persists in interferon-?

volunteers.\n All strains caused colds in volunteers, and those cultivable in tissue culture (TC) produced significantly more coryza and less sore throat than strains growing only in organ culture (OC).\n The TC strains were serologically related to 229E, but these isolates produced colds with a frequency and severity that contrasted with the effects of 229E itself.\n Tests on volunteers' preinfection sera showed that the prevalence of antibody to 229E had increased during the period 1961–1979 and that during 1977–1979 only 11% of subjects had no neutralising antibody against 229E.\n Susceptibility to the 229E?related isolates PR and TO was associated with low preinfection serum neutralising antibody against the homologous virus, and paired sera frequently showed fourfold or greater antibody rises, most commonly against the homologous strain.\n Volunteers infected with TO were immune when reinoculated with the same strain approximately 1 year later, but other similar volunteers were at least partly susceptible to infection with a heterologous 229E?related virus after similar time intervals.\n Although the strains of HCV that were grown in tissue culture were all related to the prototype 229E, they appeared not to be identical with it, and this heterogeneity is probably a significant factor in the epidemiology of HCV

An evolutionary rate of 1.12 × 10?3 substitutions per site per year (95% credible interval [95% CI], 8.76 × 10?4; 1.37 × 10?3) was estimated, bringing the time to most recent common ancestor to March 2012 (95% CI, December 2011; June 2012).\n Only one MERS-CoV codon, spike 1020, located in a domain required for cell entry, is under strong positive selection.\n Four KSA MERS-CoV phylogenetic clades were found, with 3 clades apparently no longer contributing to current cases.\n The size of the population infected with MERS-CoV showed a gradual increase to June 2013, followed by a decline, possibly due to increased surveillance and infection control measures combined with a basic reproduction number (R0) for the virus that is less than 1.","id":"PMC3944817","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"American Society of Microbiology","authors":[{"firstname":"Matthew","surname":"Cotten","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Simon J.","surname":"Watson","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alimuddin I.","surname":"Zumla","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hatem Q.","surname":"Makhdoom","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Anne L.","surname":"Palser","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Swee Hoe","surname":"Ong","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Abdullah A.","surname":"Al Rabeeah","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rafat F.","surname":"Alhakeem","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Abdullah","surname":"Assiri","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jaffar A.","surname":"Al-Tawfiq","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ali","surname":"Albarrak","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mazin","surname":"Barry","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Atef","surname":"Shibl","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Fahad A.","surname":"Alrabiah","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sami","surname":"Hajjar","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hanan H.","surname":"Balkhy","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hesham","surname":"Flemban","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Andrew","surname":"Rambaut","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Paul","surname":"Kellam","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ziad A.","surname":"Memish","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.3390/v4040557","date":"2012-04-02","title":"Ready, Set, Fuse!

Like SARS-CoV, HCoV-EMC is of zoonotic origin and closely related to bat coronaviruses.\n The human airway epithelium (HAE) represents the entry point and primary target tissue for respiratory viruses and is highly relevant for assessing the zoonotic potential of emerging respiratory viruses, such as HCoV-EMC.\n Here, we show that pseudostratified HAE cultures derived from different donors are highly permissive to HCoV-EMC infection, and by using reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and RNAseq data, we experimentally determined the identity of seven HCoV-EMC subgenomic mRNAs.\n Although the HAE cells were readily responsive to type I and type III interferon (IFN), we observed neither a pronounced inflammatory cytokine nor any detectable IFN responses following HCoV-EMC, SARS-CoV, or HCoV-229E infection, suggesting that innate immune evasion mechanisms and putative IFN antagonists of HCoV-EMC are operational in the new host.\n Importantly, however, we demonstrate that both type I and type III IFN can efficiently reduce HCoV-EMC replication in HAE cultures, providing a possible treatment option in cases of suspected HCoV-EMC infection.\n","id":"PMC3573664","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"American Society of Microbiology","authors":[{"firstname":"Eveline","surname":"Kindler","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Hulda R.","surname":"Jónsdóttir","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Doreen","surname":"Muth","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ole J.","surname":"Hamming","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rune","surname":"Hartmann","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Regulo","surname":"Rodriguez","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Robert","surname":"Geffers","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ron A.

Epithelial Cells: Cytopathic Effects and Innate Immune Response","abstract":"Because they are the natural target for respiratory pathogens, primary human respiratory epithelial cells provide the ideal in vitro system for isolation and study of human respiratory viruses, which display a high degree of cell, tissue, and host specificity.\n Human coronavirus HKU1, first discovered in 2005, has a worldwide prevalence and is associated with both upper and lower respiratory tract disease in both children and adults.\n Research on HCoV-HKU1 has been difficult because of its inability to be cultured on continuous cell lines and only recently it was isolated from clinical specimens using primary human, ciliated airway epithelial cells.\n Here we demonstrate that HCoV-HKU1 can infect and be serially propagated in primary human alveolar type II cells at the air-liquid interface.\n We were not able to infect alveolar type I-like cells or alveolar macrophages.\n Type II alveolar cells infected with HCoV-HKU1 demonstrated formation of large syncytium.\n At 72 hours post inoculation, HCoV-HKU1 infection of type II cells induced increased levels of mRNAs encoding IL29,CXCL10, CCL5, and IL-6 with no significant increases in the levels of IFN?.\n These studies demonstrate that type II cells are a target cell for HCoV-HKU1 infection in the lower respiratory tract, that type II alveolar cells are immune-competent in response to infection exhibiting a type III interferon and proinflammatory chemokine response, and that cell to cell spread may be a major factor for spread of infection.\n Furthermore, these studies demonstrate that human alveolar cells can be used to isolate and study novel human respiratory viruses that cause lower respiratory tract disease.\n","id":"PMC3722178","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Samuel

mediated by a replication/transcription complex (RTC) of which virus-encoded, non-structural proteins (nsps) are the primary constituents.\n The 16 SARS-CoV nsps are produced by autoprocessing of two large precursor polyproteins.\n The RTC is believed to be associated with characteristic virus-induced double-membrane structures in the cytoplasm of SARS-CoV-infected cells.\n To investigate the link between these structures and viral RNA synthesis, and to dissect RTC organization and function, we isolated active RTCs from infected cells and used them to develop the first robust assay for their in vitro activity.\n The synthesis of genomic RNA and all eight subgenomic mRNAs was faithfully reproduced by the RTC in this in vitro system.\n Mainly positive-strand RNAs were synthesized and protein synthesis was not required for RTC activity in vitro.\n All RTC activity, enzymatic and putative membrane-spanning nsps, and viral RNA cosedimented with heavy membrane structures.\n Furthermore, the pelleted RTC required the addition of a cytoplasmic host factor for reconstitution of its in vitro activity.\n Newly synthesized subgenomic RNA appeared to be released, while genomic RNA remained predominantly associated with the RTC-containing fraction.\n RTC activity was destroyed by detergent treatment, suggesting an important role for membranes.\n The RTC appeared to be protected by membranes, as newly synthesized viral RNA and several replicase/transcriptase subunits were protease- and nuclease-resistant and became susceptible to degradation only upon addition of a non-ionic detergent.\n Our data establish a vital functional dependence of SARS-CoV RNA synthesis on virus-induced membrane structures.\n","id":"PMC2322833","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Martijn J.","surname":"van

disease.\n The outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002/2003 has demonstrated human vulnerability to (Coronavirus) CoV epidemics.\n Neither vaccines nor therapeutics are available against human and animal CoVs.\n Knowledge of host cell proteins that take part in pivotal virus-host interactions could define broad-spectrum antiviral targets.\n In this study, we used a systems biology approach employing a genome-wide yeast-two hybrid interaction screen to identify immunopilins (PPIA, PPIB, PPIH, PPIG, FKBP1A, FKBP1B) as interaction partners of the CoV non-structural protein 1 (Nsp1).\n These molecules modulate the Calcineurin/NFAT pathway that plays an important role in immune cell activation.\n Overexpression of NSP1 and infection with live SARS-CoV strongly increased signalling through the Calcineurin/NFAT pathway and enhanced the induction of interleukin 2, compatible with late-stage immunopathogenicity and long-term cytokine dysregulation as observed in severe SARS cases.\n Conversely, inhibition of cyclophilins by cyclosporine A (CspA) blocked the replication of CoVs of all genera, including SARS-CoV, human CoV-229E and -NL-63, feline CoV, as well as avian infectious bronchitis virus.\n Non-immunosuppressive derivatives of CspA might serve as broad-range CoV inhibitors applicable against emerging CoVs as well as ubiquitous pathogens of

of Diverse Coronaviruses Including the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Virus","abstract":"Coronaviruses raise serious concerns as emerging zoonotic viruses without specific antiviral drugs available.\n Here we screened a collection of 16671 diverse compounds for anti-human coronavirus 229E activity and identified an inhibitor, designated K22, that specifically targets membrane-bound coronaviral RNA synthesis.\n K22 exerts most potent antiviral activity after virus entry during an early step of the viral life cycle.\n Specifically, the formation of double membrane vesicles (DMVs), a hallmark of coronavirus replication, was greatly impaired upon K22 treatment accompanied by near-complete inhibition of viral RNA synthesis.\n K22-resistant viruses contained substitutions in non-structural protein 6 (nsp6), a membrane-spanning integral component of the viral replication complex implicated in DMV formation, corroborating that K22 targets membrane bound viral RNA synthesis.\n Besides K22 resistance, the nsp6 mutants induced a reduced number of DMVs, displayed decreased specific infectivity, while RNA synthesis was not affected.\n Importantly, K22 inhibits a broad range of coronaviruses, including Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS–CoV), and efficient inhibition was achieved in primary human epithelia cultures representing the entry port of human coronavirus infection.\n Collectively, this study proposes an evolutionary conserved step in the life cycle of positive-stranded RNA viruses, the recruitment of cellular membranes for viral replication, as vulnerable and, most importantly, druggable target for antiviral intervention.\n We expect this mode of action to serve as a paradigm for the development of potent antiviral drugs to combat many animal and human virus infections.\n","id":"PMC4038610","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

vitro</italic> model of the human conducting airway epithelium","abstract":"SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged in 2002 as an important cause of severe lower respiratory tract infection in humans and in vitro models of the lung are needed to elucidate cellular targets and the consequences of viral infection.\n The severe and sudden onset of symptoms, resulting in an atypical pneumonia with dry cough and persistent high fever in cases of severe acute respiratory virus brought to light the importance of coronaviruses as potentially lethal human pathogens and the identification of several zoonotic reservoirs has made the reemergence of new strains and future epidemics all the more possible.\n In this chapter, we describe the pathology of SARS-CoV infection in humans and explore the use of two models of the human conducting airway to develop a better understanding of the replication and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV in relevant in vitro systems.\n The first culture model is a human bronchial epithelial cell line Calu-3 that can be inoculated by viruses either as a non-polarized monolayer of cells or polarized cells with tight junctions and microvilli.\n The second model system, derived from primary cells isolated from human airway epithelium and grown on Transwells, form a pseudostratified mucociliary epithelium that recapitulates the morphological and physiological features of the human conducting airway in vivo.\n Experimental results using these lung epithelial cell models demonstrate that in contrast to the pathology reported in late stage cases SARS-CoV replicates to high titers in epithelial cells of the conducting airway.\n The SARS-CoV receptor, human angiotensin 1 converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), was detected exclusively on the apical surface of cells in polarized Calu-3 cells and human airway epithelial cultures (HAE), indicating that hACE2 was accessible by SARS-CoV after lumenal airway delivery.\n Furthermore, in HAE, hACE2 was exclusively localized to ciliated airway epithelial cells.\n In support of the hACE2 localization data, the most productive route of inoculation and progeny virion egress in both polarized Calu-3 and ciliated cells of HAE was the apical surface suggesting mechanisms to release large quantities of virus into the lumen of the human lung.\n Preincubation of the apical surface of cultures with antisera directed against hACE2 reduced viral titers by two logs while antisera against DC-SIGN/DC-SIGNR did not reduce viral replication levels suggesting that hACE2 is the primary receptor for entry of SARS-CoV into the ciliated cells of HAE cultures.\n To assess infectivity in ciliated airway cultures derived from susceptible animal species we generated a recombinant SARS-CoV by deletion of open reading frame 7a/7b (ORF 7a/7b) and insertion of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) resulting in SARS-CoV GFP.\n SARS-CoV GFP replicated to similar titers as wild type viruses in Vero E6, MA104, and CaCo2 cells.\n In addition, SARS-CoV replication in airway epithelial cultures generated from Golden Syrian hamster tracheas reached similar titers to the human cultures by 72 h post-infection.\n Efficient SARS-CoV infection of ciliated cell-types in HAE provides a useful in vitro model of human lung origin to study characteristics of SARS-CoV replication and pathogenesis.\n","id":"PMC2384224","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier B.V.","authors":[{"firstname":"Amy

Potential Antivirals and Important Differences with SARS Coronavirus","abstract":"A novel human coronavirus (HCoV-EMC) was recently identified in the Middle East as the causative agent of a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) resembling the illness caused by SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV).\n Although derived from the CoV family, the two viruses are genetically distinct and do not use the same receptor.\n Here, we investigated whether HCoV-EMC and SARS-CoV induce similar or distinct host responses after infection of a human lung epithelial cell line.\n HCoV-EMC was able to replicate as efficiently as SARS-CoV in Calu-3 cells and similarly induced minimal transcriptomic changes before 12 h postinfection.\n Later in infection, HCoV-EMC induced a massive dysregulation of the host transcriptome, to a much greater extent than SARS-CoV.\n Both viruses induced a similar activation of pattern recognition receptors and the interleukin 17 (IL-17) pathway, but HCoV-EMC specifically down-regulated the expression of several genes within the antigen presentation pathway, including both type I and II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes.\n This could have an important impact on the ability of the host to mount an adaptive host response.\n A unique set of 207 genes was dysregulated early and permanently throughout infection with HCoV-EMC, and was used in a computational screen to predict potential antiviral compounds, including kinase inhibitors and glucocorticoids.\n Overall, HCoV-EMC and SARS-CoV elicit distinct host gene expression responses, which might impact in vivo pathogenesis and could orient therapeutic strategies against that emergent virus.\n","id":"PMC3663187","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"American Society of

2012 and has a high mortality associated with severe lung disease.\n A lack of autopsy studies from MERS fatalities has hindered understanding of MERS-CoV pathogenesis.\n We investigated the spatial and cellular localization of DPP4 to evaluate an association MERS clinical disease.\n DPP4 was rarely detected in the surface epithelium from nasal cavity to conducting airways with a slightly increased incidence in distal airways.\n DPP4 was also found in a subset of mononuclear leukocytes and in serous cells of submucosal glands.\n In the parenchyma, DPP4 was found principally in type I and II cells and alveolar macrophages and was also detected in vascular endothelium (eg, lymphatics) and pleural mesothelia.\n Patients with chronic lung disease, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cystic fibrosis, exhibited increased DPP4 immunostaining in alveolar epithelia (type I and II cells) and alveolar macrophages with similar trends in reactive mesothelia.\n This finding suggests that preexisting pulmonary disease could increase MERS-CoV receptor abundance and predispose individuals to MERS morbidity and mortality, which is consistent with current clinical observations.\n We speculate that the preferential spatial localization of DPP4 in alveolar regions may explain why MERS is characterized by lower respiratory tract disease.\n","id":"PMC4715219","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"American Society for Investigative Pathology","authors":[{"firstname":"David

responsible for more than 110,000 infections and 4000 deaths worldwide, but data regarding the epidemiologic characteristics and clinical features of infected children are limited. A recent review of 72,314 cases by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention showed that less than 1% of the cases were in children younger than 10 years of age. In order to determine the spectrum of disease in children, we evaluated children infected with SARS-CoV-2 and treated at the Wuhan Children's Hospital, the only center assigned by the central government for treating infected children under 16 years of age in Wuhan. Both symptomatic and asymptomatic children with known contact with persons having confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection were evaluated. Nasopharyngeal or throat swabs were obtained for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by established methods. The clinical outcomes were monitored up to March 8, 2020.\nOf the 1391 children assessed and tested from January 28 through February 26, 2020, a total of 171 (12.3%) were confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 infection. Demographic data and clinical features are summarized in Table 1. (Details of the laboratory and radiologic findings are provided in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org.) The median age of the infected children was 6.7 years. Fever was present in 41.5% of the children at any time during the illness. Other common signs and symptoms included cough and pharyngeal erythema. A total of 27 patients (15.8%) did not have any symptoms of infection or radiologic features of pneumonia. A total of 12 patients had radiologic features of pneumonia but did not have any symptoms of infection. During the course of hospitalization, 3 patients required intensive care support and invasive mechanical ventilation; all had coexisting conditions (hydronephrosis, leukemia [for which the patient was receiving maintenance chemotherapy], and intussusception). Lymphopenia (lymphocyte count, &lt;1.2x109 per liter) was present in 6 patients (3.5%). The most common radiologic finding was bilateral ground-glass opacity (32.7%). As of March 8, 2020, there was one death. A 10-month-old child with intussusception had multiorgan failure and died 4 weeks after admission. A total of 21 patients were in stable condition in the general wards, and 149 have been discharged from the hospital.\nThis report describes a spectrum of illness from SARS-CoV-2 infection in children. In contrast with infected adults, most infected children appear to have a milder clinical course. Asymptomatic infections were not uncommon. Determination of the transmission potential of these asymptomatic patients is important for guiding the development of measures to control the ongoing pandemic.\nDisclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org.\nThis letter was published on March 18, 2020, at NEJM.org.\nDrs.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which was also previously known as 2019-nCoV. It is the seventh coronavirus.\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) classified the outbreak as a pandemic. An interactive web-based real-time COVID-19 reporting system, known as a dashboard, has been set up by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, USA. By March 18, 2020, there had been more than 2 00 000 confirmed cases and more than 8000 deaths due to COVID-19. This corresponds to a 4.0% case fatality rate.\nA number of studies have reviewed symptoms and characteristics of adults with COVID-19. Although some of these studies have also included a smaller number of children, the aggregated data on children with COVID-19 are rare. This paper summarises the findings of a systematic literature review on the current knowledge of COVID-19 in children.\nMETHODS\nSearch process\nThe review was carried out at the Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden, and the Medline (used by PubMed) and Embase databases were searched for relevant terms related to COVID-19 and SARS-CoV2 in children. This search was carried out by two highly experienced librarians at the Institutet, and the search algorithm is presented in Appendix S1. There were 89 papers published in Medline between January 1 and March 18, 2020 and eight publications in Embase during the same period. Of those, 44 were deemed relevant to this review. Also on March 18, but later during the day, the New England Journal of Medicine published a Letter to the Editor describing 1391 children assessed for SARS-CoV-2 (171 confirmed cases). That letter was also included in this review. The initial search was complemented by a further Medline search on March 19, 2020 by the author. This focused on 2019-nCoV, but this did not yield any additional studies (Appendix S1). This means that the current review was based on 45 scientific papers and letters. Most of the studies originated from China and it was notable that there were very few reports on children from Italy, Iran or South Korea, despite the large number of patients with diagnosed COVID-19 in those countries. There was no pre-specified protocol prior to the current review.\nRESULTS\nBackground\nThe review with the largest number of positive COVID-19 cases was a Chinese paper by the Chinese Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Emergency Response Epidemiology Team with 72,314 subjects, and this found that about 2% of the 44 672 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were children aged 0-19 years. Of these, 0.9% were under the age of 10 years at diagnosis. Italian data, published on March 18, 2020, reported that only 1.2% of 22 512 Italian cases with COVID-19 were children, with no deaths. In fact, no deaths had been recorded below the age of 30 years in Italy. Of 4226 COVID-19 cases detected in the United States until March 16, 2020, 5% were children. Children constituted less than 1% of all US hospitalisations. \nIn the early stages of the epidemic, many children with COVID-19 were part of family clusters with the disease. A large number of the cases described in this review originated from the Chinese city of Wuhan, which has nine million inhabitants. Wuhan is situated 1150 km south of Beijing and 840 km west of Shanghai and is the capital of the Hubei Province, which has 58 million inhabitants.\nThe incubation period in children is usually about two days with a range of 2-10 days. \nSymptoms\nThe COVID-19 symptoms seem to be less severe in children than in adults. One study by Dong et al examined 2143 children who were identified through laboratory tests by a combination of clinical manifestations and exposure history. Of these, 34.1% had laboratory-confirmed disease, while the remainder had clinically suspected disease. Their symptoms were typical of acute respiratory infections and included fever, cough, a sore throat, sneezing, myalgia and fatigue. A number of children were wheezing. Another study from the Wuhan Children's hospital, which probably overlapped with the Dong et al study, reviewed 171 children with confirmed disease and presented more detailed symptoms. The most common symptoms were cough (48.5%), pharyngeal erythema (46.2%) and a fever of at least 37.5 C (41.5%). The authors reported that 32.1% of the children had fever above 38 C and that most of these had 38.1 C-39.0 C. Other studies have suggested that fever in children is usually below 39 C. \nOther symptoms were diarrhoea (8.8%), fatigue (7.6%), rhinorrhoea (7.6%) and vomiting (6.4%). Four out of 171 children (2.3%) had low oxygen saturations of less than 92%. It should be noted that some COVID-19 publications have defined low oxygen saturation as below 93% or 94%. A substantial proportion of children demonstrated tachypnoea (28.7%) and tachycardia (42.1%) on hospital admission. In a smaller case series of 10 Chinese children diagnosed outside Wuhan, eight had fever and six had a cough. In a study that has only been published in Chinese so far, but was referenced by Yang et al, 76.1% of 134 children with COVID-19 had fever.\nDisease severity\nIn the largest child case series so far, more than 90% of the 2,143 children diagnosed with laboratory-verified or clinically diagnosed COVID-19 -19 had asymptomatic, mild or moderate disease. Of the remainder, 5.2% had severe disease and 0.6% had critical disease. According to the disease severity classification used by several Chinese publications, severe disease was defined as dyspnoea, central cyanosis and an oxygen saturation of less than 92%. Critical disease required respiratory failure, sometimes with acute respiratory distress syndrome, shock and signs of multi-organ failure, such as encephalopathy, heart failure, abnormal coagulation and acute renal failure.\nThe prevalence of severe and critical disease was 10.6% in children aged &lt;1 at diagnosis, 1-5 years (7.3%), 6-10 years (4.2%), 11-15 years (4.1%) and 16-17 years (3.0%). Half of the children with critical COVID-19 in this study were less than one year of age, and a high prevalence of severe disease was seen in very young children also in another study. Of 171 children treated at Wuhan Children's Hospital, three (1.8%) required intensive care and all of those had underlying diseases. There was one case of hydronephrosis, one child was undergoing chemotherapy for leukaemia and another had intussusception. Yang et al have noted that the child with hydronephrosis in question had bilateral hydronephrosis with renal calculus. \nThe percentage of 123 US children with COVID-19 in need of hospital admission was 1.6%-2.5% with no child needing intensive care. \nDeaths\nIn a study of 44 672 confirmed COVID-19 cases up to February 11, 2020 (both adults and children), there were 965 deaths (2.2%). One child died in the 10-19 year age group, and no children aged 0-9 years died. No more information was given about the child who died and whether the test for COVID-19 was performed before or after death. The authors mentioned that some testing was carried out retrospectively, but they were not any more specific. The dead child was probably the 14-year-old boy described in the paper by Dong et al  The two research groups seem to have used the same data source, from China's Infectious Disease Information System and the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and they seemed to cover much of the same time period. Lu et al also reported the death of a 10-month-old child with intussusception and multi-organ failure. None of the 123 US children with COVID-19 have died so far. This means that this review was able to identify two deaths in children with COVID-19 up to March 18, 2020.\nPrognosis\nOne study reported that of 171 children diagnosed and admitted to hospital between January and 26 February, and 149 (87.1%) had been discharged by March 8, 2020. In addition, a study by Cao et al of 398 paediatric cases outside the Hubei Province claimed that most of the children recovered within 1-2 weeks. \nSigns\nEarly studies in adult populations found increased liver enzymes, anaemia and increased inflammatory markers, such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin and sometimes hyperglycaemia. Data on laboratory markers in children with COVID-19 were rare, according to this review. The exception was a study by Henry et al that summarised the findings from 12 different studies on 66 children. The authors found that 69.2% of the children had normal leucocyte counts and that neutrophilia (4.6%) and neutropenia (6.0%) were rare. Only two children (3.0%) experienced lymphocytopenia. C-reactive protein and procalcitonin were increased in 13.6% and 10.6% of cases, respectively. In a separate study that was not reviewed by Henry et al, lymphocytopenia was seen in 3.5% children. \nThe clinical spectrum of children with COVID-19 has often been similar to that of influenza. This was demonstrated by a Chinese study of 366 children up to the age of 16 years, who were hospitalised with respiratory symptoms in the early phase of the epidemic. Many of these children did not have COVID-19 but were instead diagnosed with the influenza A or B virus. \nComputed chest tomography\nLu et al reported that ground-glass opacity was seen in a third of 171 diagnosed children. Local or bilateral patchy shadowing was seen in 18.7% and 12.3%, respectively. Overall, 15.8% of children did not have symptoms of infections or radiological features of pneumonia. A clinical diagnosis of pneumonia was made in 64.9% of the children. \nA second study reviewed five children and reported that three had modest patchy ground-glass opacities on computed chest tomography. This was consistent with data reported by Liu et al  Finally, Xia et al examined 20 children with computed tomography and found that 16 (80%) had some abnormalities, including halo signs, with ground-glass opacities seen in 12 patients (60%). Another Chinese report, cited in Yang et al, found viral pneumonia-like changes in 70.4% of 134 children undergoing chest imaging. It was unclear whether this was carried out using X-rays or computed tomography.\nAge\nIn the largest Chinese paediatric case series to date, of 2143 subjects, the median age at paediatric diagnosis was seven years. The median was 6.7 years (range 1 day to 15 years) in 171 patients from the Wuhan Children's Hospital, who were better characterised. Children of all ages can be infected, including newborn infants and young children. \nNewborn infants with COVID-19\nAccording to data from the National Health Commission of China, cited by Cai et al, three neonatal cases were reported up to 20 February. At the same time, the total number of adult and paediatric cases in China was close to 80 000. The first neonate had fever and a cough for three days, and the second had a runny nose and vomiting for one week. The youngest child, who was diagnosed at 30 hours of age, after being born to an infected mother, had respiratory distress, but no fever.\nSchwartz reviewed five publications from China and was able to identify 38 pregnant women with 39 offspring: nine of the offspring were described in detail by Chen et al  and another 10 by Zhu et al. Of the 39 offspring, 30 were tested for COVID-19 and all of them were negative. Schwartz noted that none of the pregnant women had developed severe pneumonia or died. The relatively mild disease course in the 38 pregnant women was consistent with the conclusion of a World Health Organization joint mission that investigated 149 pregnant women and found that pregnancy did not seem to be a risk factor for severe COVID-19 disease. However, having COVID-19 during pregnancy may still have an impact on foetal outcome, namely foetal distress, potential preterm birth and respiratory distress. \nSex\nDong et al  reported that 56.6% of the 2143 patients in their study were boys.\nComorbidities\nA number of case reports have described comorbidities in children with COVID-19, but this review was unable to identify any study that quantified the prevalence of comorbidities in children. The section on disease severity in this paper notes that one study of 171 patients found that the three who required intensive care all had an underlying disease. \nDiagnosis\nCOVID-19 has mostly been diagnosed using nasal or pharyngeal swabs or blood specimens that were positive for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid using real-time, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assays. Alternative diagnostics have included genetic sequencing of specimens from the respiratory tract or blood consistent with SARS-CoV2.\nClinical diagnosis has been used for some cases, at least in China. Diagnoses have been based on the presence of at least two symptoms (fever, respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms or fatigue), combined with laboratory tests (normal or low white blood cell count, and increased C-reactive protein) and an abnormal chest X-ray. Dong et al reported that other infectious diseases, such as influenza, were excluded before the patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, but no details were given. This means that some of the cases reported in the Chinese papers did not have laboratory-verified diagnoses.\nManagement and treatment\nThis review was not able to identify any drug trials or testing that was specifically aimed at children. Most publications that commented on treatment mentioned supportive treatment, including oxygen therapy and antibiotics for bacterial superinfections. Some, but not all researchers, recommended antiviral treatment. Antiviral treatment was clearly used in severe cases, but data on its efficacy in children with COVID-19 are missing.\nChinese physicians have recommended that children diagnosed with COVID-19 undergo a chest X-ray examination, preferably computed tomography. A detailed epidemiological history should be taken. An extensive clinical examination should be performed and laboratory tests taken. Differential diagnoses include influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus and other known viral infections. They also include mycoplasma pneumoniae and chlamydia pneumonia and bacterial pneumonia. Recommended treatment is outlined in Table 1.\nRecommended treatment, after Shen et al\n\n\nBreathing and airway	Other support	Infectious disease	Experimental treatmenta	 	Oxygen supply	Caloric intake (for a review of nutritional interventions see Zhang and Liu)	Antibiotics when there are bacterial superinfections	Interferon-alphab	 	Inhalations	Water and electrolyte supply/balance	 	Lopinavir/litonavirb	 	Keeping respiratory tract unobstructed	Anti-pyretics if high fever	 	Interleukin-6 inhibitorsb	 	Regular re-examination of airways	 	 	Arbidol, oseltamivir, ribavirin and other anti-influenza drugsb	 	Non-invasive/invasive respiratory support/mechanical ventilation including ECMO	 	 	Glucocorticoids	 	Fluid resuscitation, vasoactive drugs	 	 	Immunoglobulin	 	 	 	 	Traditional Chinese medicine	 	\nNot yet supported by the literature.\nSuggested dosages and pharmacological aspects of antiviral treatment of COVID-19 in children have been reviewed by Wang and Zhu.\n\nOne Chinese consensus group recommended discharge from hospital when three criteria were satisfied. These were that the child's body temperature had been normal for three days, the respiratory symptoms had improved and the SARS-CoV2 tests were negative. This group also stressed the importance of blocking transmission routes. The importance of potential faecal transmission remains unclear. \nThe secondary consequences of schools being closed and children being confined to their home were reviewed by Wang et al. The authors suggested that these measures may have negative effects on the children's physical and mental health. Such adverse effects included longer screen time, irregular sleep, less healthy diets that resulted in weight gain and loss of cardiorespiratory fitness. In a study that was not related to the COVID-19 pandemic, Sprang et al reported that when children were quarantined and isolated after health-related disasters this could greatly increase the risk of post-traumatic stress disorder (data based on survey, focus groups and interviews from 398 parents). \nZhang and Liu reviewed the potential interventions for COVID-19, but these were primarily aimed at adult patients. In addition to nutritional support, the authors mention treatment with interferons, intravenous gamma globulin, thymosin alpha-1, thymopentin, levamisole, cyclosporine A and traditional Chinese medicine. Of note, one in three patients treated with intravenous gamma globulin during the SARS 2003 epidemic developed venous thromboembolism. \nDISCUSSION\nThis systematic review aimed to define the current evidence on COVID-19 in children. It identified 45 relevant publications, but I cannot rule out that there were other reports that my search algorithm may have missed. The literature search was carried out in English, but some identified papers presented results in Chinese but with English abstracts or summaries.\nCOVID-19 is either rare in children or it has not been diagnosed that often because this age group remain asymptomatic. One study suggested that 86% of all early COVID-19 infections in China remained undiagnosed. While undiagnosed (undocumented) cases may have a lower transmission rate, their greater number suggests that they may have been the source of 79% of all early cases. This may have implications if children with few symptoms are cared for by elderly people who constitute a risk group for COVID-19.\nChildren have represented some 2% of diagnosed cases in China, 1.2% of cases in Italy and 5% of COVID-19-positive cases in the United States. These low figures were consistent with data from the SARS epidemic in 2003, when 6.9% of the positive cases were children, but none died. These data, from the e-SARS database in Hong Kong, were cited by Caselli et al.  \nEarlier reports regarding adults with COVID-19 indicated a high prevalence of comorbidities. For example, comorbidities were reported in 26.0% of 44 672 confirmed cases recorded by the Chinese Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Emergency Response Epidemiology Team. In adults, the most common comorbidities were hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and chronic respiratory disease. The report did not contain any information on the prevalence of these diseases in members of the general population who were a similar age. However, 67.2% of those who died from COVID-19 had a comorbidity and this higher prevalence suggests that comorbidity is a risk factor for poor prognosis. This review only identifies case reports of children with COVID-19 and comorbidities. In adults, cancer does not seem to be a risk factor for severe disease. One of the 171 hospitalised children in the Lu et al study had leukaemia and was receiving ongoing chemotherapy when being diagnosed with COVID-19. Recommendations for the management of sick children who are diagnosed with COVID-19 are appearing quickly. While death is extremely rare in children with COVID-19, it can occur in patients who are already very sick.\nCoronavirus disease 2019 seems to have a milder course in children than in adults, and the obvious question is why? Several suggestions have been put forward. Children, especially smaller children, tend to have many viral infections. It is possible that repeated viral exposure supports the immune system when it responds to SARS-CoV-2. There have also been suggestions that the SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 and that children may be protected against SARS-CoV-2 because this enzyme is less mature at a younger age. The immune system undergoes substantial changes from birth to adulthood. \nThe proportion of children with COVID-19 with elevated inflammatory markers has reportedly been low. Severe cases of COVID-19 have been linked to increased levels of procalcitonin. Henry et al cited a Chinese paper that described how a young, very sick infant developed high interleukin-6 levels and trials of interleukin-6 inhibitors are on their way. Other trials underway are examining the efficacy of the drugs remdesivir and chloroquine.\nIt is worth noting that studies focusing on adults have reported very high rates of lymphocytopenia. For example, Guan et al studied 1099 subjects and found that the rate was 83.2% in adults. However, only nine of the subjects were children. These adult data contrasted with data from a study of 171 children, where only 3.5% had lymphocytopenia, and the 3.0% in the case series published by Henry et al  Future studies on the severity of COVID-19 should focus on the role of lymphocytes and their interaction with SARS-COV2. In the 2003 SARS epidemic, a study cited by Henry et al  reported that lymphocytopenia was seen in 46% of children and that neutropenia was seen in 52%.\nLack of smoking in children is unlikely to explain the lower prevalence of severe COVID-19 in paediatric patients. Smoking does not seem to be a major feature in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 in adults. \nIt is important to note that a large share of the scientific evidence so far has originated from China, and it is possible that country-specific factors there differ from children in some other countries. These include differences in day care and nutritional status and to what extent children come into contact with sick individuals.\nAn expert consensus statement published by the World Journal of Pediatrics  in late January 2020 included a number of recommendations (Table 1). However, these were clearly based on findings from adults. More recent studies on children with COVID-19 are likely to have an impact on future recommendations. For instance, the current paediatric recommendations in China do not reflect the milder disease course and the different laboratory findings seen in children. It can therefore be questioned whether children with mild COVID-19, normal inflammatory markers and normal oxygen levels should really undergo computed tomography or chest X-ray.\nAlthough the data are scarce, there seems to be little, if any, vertical intrauterine transmission from pregnant mothers to newborn infants. Cord blood and placental tissue in COVID-19-positive mothers have been negative for SARS-COV2, and in a small series of 30 offspring none of the subjects developed COVID-19. However, it is worth noting that many of these children were delivered by Caesarean section. To what extent maternal hypoxaemia in delivering mothers can lead to intrauterine asphyxia and preterm birth in the offspring seems to be unknown.\nThere have been reports of newborn infants who have tested positive to COVID-19 after being born mothers who have also tested positive. Chinese neonatologists and obstetricians have recently proposed how to prevent and control COVID-19 infections in newborn infants. Until now, there have been no reports of COVID-19 transmission within neonatal intensive care units, but although children seem to have less symptoms than adult patients also newborn infants can suffer from respiratory distress and are likely to transmit the disease if sick. \nThe main strength of this study was that it used well-established databases and wide-ranging search terms to pick up as many studies as possible up to March 18, 2020. The main limitation was that we were unable to read the full text of some of the identified Chinese studies but had to rely on English language summaries or publications that referenced papers published in Chinese.\nCONCLUSION\nIn conclusion, this review identified 45 relevant studies on COVID-19 in children and the majority of the data were from China. Many of these studies seemed to overlap, with regard to the data they presented, and some of the children who were diagnosed with COVID-19 did not have their diagnoses verified by laboratory tests. This has implications for prognosis. For example, Dong et al found that children with suspected COVID-19 had more severe disease than those with laboratory-confirmed disease. This suggests that a number of suspected COVID-19 cases may have been caused by other pathogens, and it may still be too early to conclude that young children have a more severe COVID-19 than older children.\nOur key findings were that the disease course in paediatric COVID-19 was milder than in adults, children had a better prognosis and deaths were extremely rare.\nCONFLICTS OF INTEREST\nThe author is co-ordinating an unrelated study on behalf of the Swedish Inflammatory Bowel Disease Quality Register that has received funding from the Janssen Corporation.\nSupporting information\nREFERENCES\nA Novel Coronavirus from Patients with Pneumonia in China, 2019\nAn interactive web-based dashboard to track COVID-19 in real time\nClinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 in China\nEarly transmission dynamics in Wuhan, China, of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia\nCOVID-19 in children: initial characterization of the pediatric disease\nPersons evaluated for 2019 novel coronavirus -

pulmonary complications can result in significant morbidity and mortality, cardiovascular complications may also occur.\n\n\nObjective\nThis brief report evaluates cardiovascular complications in the setting of COVID-19 infection.\n\n\nDiscussion\nThe current COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in over one million infected worldwide and thousands of death.\n\n The virus binds and enters through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).\n\n COVID-19 can result in systemic inflammation, multiorgan dysfunction, and critical illness.\n\n The cardiovascular system is also affected, with complications including myocardial injury, myocarditis, acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, dysrhythmias, and venous thromboembolic events.\n\n Current therapies for COVID-19 may interact with cardiovascular medications.\n\n\nConclusions\nEmergency clinicians should be aware of these cardiovascular complications when evaluating and managing the patient with

features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China,

Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui Ming, Hui Hoy and Chow Sin Lan Charity Fund Limited, Marina Man-Wai Lee, the Hong Kong Hainan Commercial Association South China Microbiology Research Fund, Sanming Project of Medicine (Shenzhen), and High Level-Hospital Program (Guangdong Health Commission).\n\n\n","id":"PMC7159286","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Jasper Fuk-Woo","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shuofeng","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kin-Hang","surname":"Kok","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kelvin Kai-Wang","surname":"To","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hin","surname":"Chu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jin","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fanfan","surname":"Xing","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jieling","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Cyril Chik-Yan","surname":"Yip","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rosana Wing-Shan","surname":"Poon","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hoi-Wah","surname":"Tsoi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Simon Kam-Fai","surname":"Lo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kwok-Hung","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Vincent Kwok-Man","surname":"Poon","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wan-Mui","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jonathan Daniel","surname":"Ip","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jian-Piao","surname":"Cai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Vincent Chi-Chung","surname":"Cheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Honglin","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christopher Kim-Ming","surname":"Hui","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kwok-Yung","surname":"Yuen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"National Recommendations for Diagnosis and Treatment of pneumonia caused by 2019-nCoV (the 4th edition).

secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with

analysis of the receptor binding of 2019-nCoV","abstract":"2019-nCoV is a newly identified coronavirus with high similarity to SARS-CoV.\n We performed a structural analysis of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike glycoprotein responsible for entry of coronaviruses into host cells.\n The RBDs from the two viruses share 72% identity in amino acid sequences, and molecular simulation reveals highly similar ternary structures.\n However, 2019-nCoV has a distinct loop with flexible glycyl residues replacing rigid prolyl residues in SARS-CoV.\n Molecular modeling revealed that 2019-nCoV RBD has a stronger interaction with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).\n A unique phenylalanine F486 in the flexible loop likely plays a major role because its penetration into a deep hydrophobic pocket in ACE2. ACE2 is widely expressed with conserved primary structures throughout the animal kingdom from fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, to mammals.\n Structural analysis suggests that ACE2 from these animals can potentially bind RBD of 2019-nCoV, making them all possible natural hosts for the virus.\n 2019-nCoV is thought to be transmitted through respiratory droplets.\n However, since ACE2 is predominantly expressed in intestines, testis, and kidney, fecal-oral and other routes of transmission are also possible.\n Finally, antibodies and small molecular inhibitors that can block the interaction of ACE2 with RBD should be developed to combat the virus.\n","id":"PMC7092824","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"The Authors.

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

showed 79.0% nucleotide identity with the sequence of SARS-CoV (GenBank NC_004718) and 51.8% identity with the sequence of MERS-CoV (GenBank NC_019843).\n\n The virus is phylogenetically closest to a bat SARS-like CoV (SL-ZC45, GenBank MG772933) with 87.6% to 87.7% nucleotide identity, but is in a separate clade.\n\n Moreover, these viruses have a single intact open reading frame gene 8, as a further indicator of bat-origin CoVs.\n\n However, the amino acid sequence of the tentative receptor-binding domain resembles that of SARS-CoV, indicating that these viruses might use the same receptor.\n\n\nConclusion\nA novel bat-borne CoV was identified that is associated with severe and fatal respiratory disease in humans.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7147275","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Wolters Kluwer

caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were based on information from the general population.\n\n Limited data are available for pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in pregnancy and the intrauterine vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 infection.\n\n\nMethods\nClinical records, laboratory results, and chest CT scans were retrospectively reviewed for nine pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia (ie, with maternal throat swab samples that were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) who were admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, from Jan 20 to Jan 31, 2020. Evidence of intrauterine vertical transmission was assessed by testing for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in amniotic fluid, cord blood, and neonatal throat swab samples.\n\n Breastmilk samples were also collected and tested from patients after the first lactation.\n\n\nFindings\nAll nine patients had a caesarean section in their third trimester.\n\n Seven patients presented with a fever.\n\n Other symptoms, including cough (in four of nine patients), myalgia (in three), sore throat (in two), and malaise (in two), were also observed.\n\n Fetal distress was monitored in two cases.\n\n Five of nine patients had lymphopenia (&lt;1·0?×?10? cells per L).\n\n Three patients had increased aminotransferase concentrations.\n\n None of the patients developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died, as of Feb 4, 2020. Nine livebirths were recorded.\n\n No neonatal asphyxia was observed in newborn babies.\n\n All nine livebirths had a 1-min Apgar score of 8–9 and a 5-min Apgar score of 9–10. Amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk samples from six patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and all samples tested negative for the virus.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe clinical characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women were similar to those reported for non-pregnant adult patients who developed COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n Findings from this small group of cases suggest that there is currently no evidence for intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission in women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy.\n\n\nFunding\nHubei Science and Technology Plan, Wuhan University Medical Development Plan.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7159281","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Huijun","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Juanjuan","surname":"Guo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chen","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fan","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xuechen","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiafu","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Dongchi","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dan","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qing","surname":"Gong","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Liao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Huixia","surname":"Yang","email":"yanghuixia@bjmu.edu.cn","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Hou","email":"houwei@whu.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuanzhen","surname":"Zhang","email":"zhangyuanzhen@whu.edu.cn","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A confirmed patient had real-time RT-PCR detection before admission for three times, all negative for 2019-nCoV","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Interview with Peng Zhiyong, director of critical medicine department, Central South Hospital, Wuhan University","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Bulletin of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia from Wuhan Municipal Health Commission","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Bulletin of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia from Wuhan Municipal Health Commission","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The notice of launching guideline on diagnosis and treatment of the novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP)","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Tissue distribution of ACE2 protein, the functional receptor for SARS coronavirus.

city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data.\n\n Outcomes were followed up until Jan 25,

real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having

potential of COVID-19 infection in nine pregnant women: a retrospective review of medical records","abstract":"Background\nPrevious studies on the pneumonia outbreak caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were based on information from the general population.\n\n Limited data are available for pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in pregnancy and the intrauterine vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 infection.\n\n\nMethods\nClinical records, laboratory results, and chest CT scans were retrospectively reviewed for nine pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia (ie, with maternal throat swab samples that were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) who were admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, from Jan 20 to Jan 31, 2020. Evidence of intrauterine vertical transmission was assessed by testing for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in amniotic fluid, cord blood, and neonatal throat swab samples.\n\n Breastmilk samples were also collected and tested from patients after the first lactation.\n\n\nFindings\nAll nine patients had a caesarean section in their third trimester.\n\n Seven patients presented with a fever.\n\n Other symptoms, including cough (in four of nine patients), myalgia (in three), sore throat (in two), and malaise (in two), were also observed.\n\n Fetal distress was monitored in two cases.\n\n Five of nine patients had lymphopenia (&lt;1·0?×?10? cells per L).\n\n Three patients had increased aminotransferase concentrations.\n\n None of the patients developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died, as of Feb 4, 2020. Nine livebirths were recorded.\n\n No neonatal asphyxia was observed in newborn babies.\n\n All nine livebirths had a 1-min Apgar score of 8–9 and a 5-min Apgar score of 9–10. Amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk samples from six patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and all samples tested negative for the virus.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe clinical characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women were similar to those reported for non-pregnant adult patients who developed COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n Findings from this small group of cases suggest that there is currently no evidence for intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission in women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy.\n\n\nFunding\nHubei Science and Technology Plan, Wuhan University Medical Development Plan.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7159281","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Huijun","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Juanjuan","surname":"Guo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chen","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fan","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuechen","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiafu","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dongchi","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dan","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qing","surname":"Gong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Liao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huixia","surname":"Yang","email":"yanghuixia@bjmu.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Hou","email":"houwei@whu.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuanzhen","surname":"Zhang","email":"zhangyuanzhen@whu.edu.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30154-9","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020.

immunopathology and impaired pulmonary gas exchange.\n Gaining a deeper understanding of the interaction between Coronaviruses and the innate immune systems of the hosts may shed light on the development and persistence of inflammation in the lungs and hopefully can reduce the risk of lung inflammation caused by CoVs.\n In this review, we provide an update on CoV infections and relevant

Features Predicting Mortality Risk in Patients With Viral Pneumonia: The MuLBSTA Score","abstract":"Objective\nThe aim of this study was to further clarify clinical characteristics and predict mortality risk among patients with viral pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nA total of 528 patients with viral pneumonia at RuiJin hospital in Shanghai from May 2015 to May 2019 were recruited.\n\n Multiplex real-time RT-PCR was used to detect respiratory viruses.\n\n Demographic information, comorbidities, routine laboratory examinations, immunological indexes, etiological detections, radiological images and treatment were collected on admission.\n\n\nResults\n76 (14.4%) patients died within 90 days in hospital.\n\n A predictive MuLBSTA score was calculated on the basis of a multivariate logistic regression model in order to predict mortality with a weighted score that included multilobular infiltrates (OR = 5.20, 95% CI 1.41–12.52, p = 0.010; 5 points), lymphocyte ? 0.8?109/L (OR = 4.53, 95% CI 2.55–8.05, p &lt; 0.001; 4 points), bacterial coinfection (OR = 3.71, 95% CI 2.11–6.51, p &lt; 0.001; 4 points), acute-smoker (OR = 3.19, 95% CI 1.34–6.26, p = 0.001; 3 points), quit-smoker (OR =

used as a cut-off value for mortality risk stratification.\n\n This model showed sensitivity of 0.776, specificity of 0.778 and a better predictive ability than CURB-65 (AUROC = 0.773 vs.\n\n 0.717, p &lt; 0.001).\n\n\nConclusion\nHere, we designed an easy-to-use clinically predictive tool for assessing 90-day mortality risk of viral pneumonia.\n\n It can accurately stratify hospitalized patients with viral pneumonia into relevant risk categories and could provide guidance to make further clinical decisions.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6901688","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Frontiers

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

the pneumonia outbreak caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were based on information from the general population.\n\n Limited data are available for pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in pregnancy and the intrauterine vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 infection.\n\n\nMethods\nClinical records, laboratory results, and chest CT scans were retrospectively reviewed for nine pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia (ie, with maternal throat swab samples that were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) who were admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, from Jan 20 to Jan 31, 2020. Evidence of intrauterine vertical transmission was assessed by testing for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in amniotic fluid, cord blood, and neonatal throat swab samples.\n\n Breastmilk samples were also collected and tested from patients after the first lactation.\n\n\nFindings\nAll nine patients had a caesarean section in their third trimester.\n\n Seven patients presented with a fever.\n\n Other symptoms, including cough (in four of nine patients), myalgia (in three), sore throat (in two), and malaise (in two), were also observed.\n\n Fetal distress was monitored in two cases.\n\n Five of nine patients had lymphopenia (&lt;1·0?×?10? cells per L).\n\n Three patients had increased aminotransferase concentrations.\n\n None of the patients developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died, as of Feb 4, 2020. Nine livebirths were recorded.\n\n No neonatal asphyxia was observed in newborn babies.\n\n All nine livebirths had a 1-min Apgar score of 8–9 and a 5-min Apgar score of 9–10. Amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk samples from six patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and all samples tested negative for the virus.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe clinical characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women were similar to those reported for non-pregnant adult patients who developed COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n Findings from this small group of cases suggest that there is currently no evidence for intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission in women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy.\n\n\nFunding\nHubei Science and

lavage (BAL) specimens from five patients with severe pneumonia from Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, Hubei province, China.\n\n Nucleic acids of the BAL were extracted and subjected to next-generation sequencing.\n\n Virus isolation was carried out, and maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees were constructed.\n\n\nResults\nFive patients hospitalized from December 18 to December 29, 2019 presented with fever, cough, and dyspnea accompanied by complications of acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n Chest radiography revealed diffuse opacities and consolidation.\n\n One of these patients died.\n\n Sequence results revealed the presence of a previously unknown ?-CoV strain in all five patients, with 99.8% to 99.9% nucleotide identities among the isolates.\n\n These isolates showed 79.0% nucleotide identity with the sequence of SARS-CoV (GenBank NC_004718) and 51.8% identity with the sequence of MERS-CoV (GenBank NC_019843).\n\n The virus is phylogenetically closest to a bat

characterisation and epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and

2020.\nFindings\nOf the 99 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, 49 (49%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market.\n\n The average age of the patients was 55·5 years (SD 13·1), including 67 men and 32 women.\n\n 2019-nCoV was detected in all patients by real-time RT-PCR.\n\n 50 (51%) patients had chronic diseases.\n\n Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (82 [83%] patients),

by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), as a result of zoonotic CoVs crossing the species barrier, caused high pathogenicity and mortality rates in human populations.\n This brought CoVs global attention and highlighted the importance of controlling infectious pathogens at international borders.\n In this review, we focus on our current understanding of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, prevention, and treatment of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as provides details on the pivotal structure and function of the spike proteins (S proteins) on the surface of each of these viruses.\n For building up more suitable animal models, we compare the current animal models recapitulating pathogenesis and summarize the potential role of host receptors contributing to diverse host affinity in various species.\n We outline the research still needed to fully elucidate the pathogenic mechanism of these viruses, to construct reproducible animal models, and ultimately develop countermeasures to conquer not only SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, but also these emerging coronaviral

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020.

pregnant women (12) who presented with SARS in Hong Kong between February 1 and July 31, 2003, were included.\n\n The pregnancy and perinatal outcomes were collected.\n\n Evidence of perinatal transmission of virus was assessed with the SARS-associated coronavirus reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction on cord blood, placenta tissue, and subsequent follow-up of the neonate on serology.\n\n\nResults\nThree deaths occurred among the 12 patients, giving a case fatality rate of 25%.\n\n Four of the 7 patients (57%) who presented in the first trimester had spontaneous miscarriage.\n\n Four of the 5 patients who presented after 24 weeks were delivered preterm.\n\n Two mothers recovered without delivery, but their ongoing pregnancies were complicated by intrauterine

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12

patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar

coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China.\n\n We aimed to further clarify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data.\n\n Outcomes were followed up until Jan 25, 2020.\nFindings\nOf the 99 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, 49 (49%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market.\n\n The average age of the patients was 55·5 years (SD 13·1), including 67 men and 32 women.\n\n 2019-nCoV was detected in all patients by real-time RT-PCR.\n\n 50 (51%) patients had chronic diseases.\n\n Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (82 [83%] patients), cough (81 [82%] patients), shortness of breath (31 [31%] patients), muscle ache (11 [11%] patients), confusion (nine [9%] patients), headache (eight [8%] patients), sore throat (five [5%] patients), rhinorrhoea (four [4%] patients), chest pain (two [2%] patients), diarrhoea (two [2%] patients), and nausea and vomiting (one [1%] patient).\n\n According to imaging examination, 74 (75%) patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 14 (14%) patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity, and one (1%) patient had pneumothorax.\n\n 17 (17%) patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and, among them, 11 (11%) patients worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection was of clustering onset, is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n In general, characteristics of patients who died were in line with the MuLBSTA score, an early warning model for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia.\n\n Further investigation is needed to explore the applicability of the MuLBSTA score in predicting the risk of mortality in 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key R&amp;D Program of China.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7135076","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

humans.\n Human-to-human transmissions have been described with incubation times between 2-10 days, facilitating its spread via droplets, contaminated hands or surfaces.\n We therefore reviewed the literature on all available information about the persistence of human and veterinary coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces as well as inactivation strategies with biocidal agents used for chemical disinfection, e.\ng.\n in healthcare facilities.\n The analysis of 22 studies reveals that human coronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus or endemic human coronaviruses (HCoV) can persist on inanimate surfaces like metal, glass or plastic for up to 9 days, but can be efficiently inactivated by surface disinfection procedures with 62–71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite within 1 minute.\n Other biocidal agents such as 0.05–0.2% benzalkonium chloride or 0.02% chlorhexidine digluconate are less effective.\n As no specific therapies are available for SARS-CoV-2, early containment and prevention of further spread will be crucial to stop the ongoing outbreak and to control

associated with close contact to SARS patients and droplet secretions of those patients.\n The finding of positive RT-PCR results from stools of SARS patients suggests that stools of SARS patients or sewage containing stools of patients could transmit SARS-CoV.\n We used a novel style of electropositive filter media particle to concentrate the SARS-CoV from the sewage of two hospitals receiving SARS patients in Beijing.\n We also used cell culture, RT-PCR and gene sequencing to detect and identify the viruses from sewage.\n No infectious SARS-CoV contamination was found in any of the samples collected, but the nucleic acid of SARS-CoV could be detected in the sewage from the two hospitals before disinfection.\n While the RNA was only detected in three samples from the 309th Hospital, the others were negative after disinfection.\n These findings provide strong evidence that SARS-CoV can be excreted through the stool/urine of patients into sewage system, thus making the sewage system a

the pneumonia outbreak caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were based on information from the general population.\n\n Limited data are available for pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in pregnancy and the intrauterine vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 infection.\n\n\nMethods\nClinical records, laboratory results, and chest CT scans were retrospectively reviewed for nine pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia (ie, with maternal throat swab samples that were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) who were admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, from Jan 20 to Jan 31, 2020. Evidence of intrauterine vertical transmission was assessed by testing for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in amniotic fluid, cord blood, and neonatal throat swab samples.\n\n Breastmilk samples were also collected and tested from patients after the first lactation.\n\n\nFindings\nAll nine patients had a caesarean section in their third trimester.\n\n Seven patients presented with a fever.\n\n Other symptoms, including cough (in four of nine patients), myalgia (in three), sore throat (in two), and malaise (in two), were also observed.\n\n Fetal distress was monitored in two cases.\n\n Five of nine patients had lymphopenia (&lt;1·0?×?10? cells per L).\n\n Three patients had increased aminotransferase concentrations.\n\n None of the patients developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died, as of Feb 4, 2020. Nine livebirths were recorded.\n\n No neonatal asphyxia was observed in newborn babies.\n\n All nine livebirths had a 1-min Apgar score of 8–9 and a 5-min Apgar score of 9–10. Amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk samples from six patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and all samples tested negative for the virus.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe clinical characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women were similar to those reported for non-pregnant adult patients who developed COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n Findings from this small group of cases suggest that there is currently no evidence for intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission in women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy.\n\n\nFunding\nHubei Science and

envelope protein: current knowledge","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>Coronaviruses (CoVs) primarily cause enzootic infections in birds and mammals but, in the last few decades, have shown to be capable of infecting humans as well.\n\n The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and, more recently, Middle-East respiratory syndrome (MERS) has demonstrated the lethality of CoVs when they cross the species barrier and infect humans.\n\n A renewed interest in coronaviral research has led to the discovery of several novel human CoVs and since then much progress has been made in understanding the CoV life cycle.\n\n The CoV envelope (E) protein is a small, integral membrane protein involved in several aspects of the virus’ life cycle, such as assembly, budding, envelope formation, and pathogenesis.\n\n Recent studies have expanded on its structural motifs and topology, its functions as an ion-channelling viroporin, and its interactions with both other CoV proteins and host cell proteins.\n\n\nMain body\nid='Par2'>This review aims to establish the current knowledge on CoV E by highlighting the recent progress that has been made and comparing it to previous knowledge.\n\n It also compares E to other viral proteins of a similar nature to speculate the relevance of these new findings.\n\n Good progress has been made but much still remains unknown and this review has identified some gaps in the current knowledge and made suggestions for consideration in future research.\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par3'>The most progress has been made on SARS-CoV E, highlighting specific structural requirements for its functions in the CoV life cycle as well as mechanisms behind its pathogenesis.\n\n Data shows that E is involved in critical aspects of the viral life cycle and that CoVs lacking E make promising vaccine candidates.\n\n The high mortality rate of certain CoVs, along with their ease of transmission, underpins the need for more research into CoV molecular biology which can aid in the production of effective anti-coronaviral agents for both human CoVs and enzootic CoVs.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6537279","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

other SARS-related coronaviruses.\n Remarkably, its orf3b encodes a completely novel short protein.\n Furthermore, its new orf8 likely encodes a secreted protein with an alpha-helix, following with a beta-sheet(s) containing six strands.\n Learning from the roles of civet in SARS and camel in MERS, hunting for the animal source of 2019-nCoV and its more ancestral virus would be important for

cellular functions.\n When overwhelming the antioxidant defense system, the excess of ROS induces oxidative stress.\n Viral infections lead to diseases characterized by a broad spectrum of clinical symptoms, with oxidative stress being one of their hallmarks.\n In many cases, ROS can, in turn, enhance viral replication leading to an amplification loop.\n Another important parameter for viral

can be compensated by micronutrient supplementation.\n Among the nutrients implicated in viral infection, selenium (Se) has an important role in antioxidant defense, redox signaling and redox homeostasis.\n Most of biological activities of selenium is performed through its incorporation as a rare amino acid selenocysteine in the essential family of selenoproteins.\n Selenium deficiency, which is the main regulator of selenoprotein expression, has been associated with the pathogenicity of several viruses.\n In addition, several selenoprotein members, including glutathione peroxidases

Injury Independent of Neutrophil Infiltration","abstract":"Background\nVentilator-induced lung injury is a form of acute lung injury that develops in critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation and has a high degree of mortality.\n\n Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase is an enzyme that is highly upregulated in ventilator-induced lung injury and exacerbates the injury when given exogenously.\n\n Nicotinamide (vitamin B3) directly inhibits downstream pathways activated by Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase and is protective in other models of acute lung injury.\n\n\nMethods\nWe administered nicotinamide i.\n\np.\n\n to mice undergoing mechanical ventilation with high tidal volumes to study the effects of nicotinamide on ventilator-induced lung injury.\n\n Measures of injury included oxygen saturations and bronchoalveolar lavage neutrophil counts, protein, and cytokine levels.\n\n We also measured expression of nicotinamide phosophoribosyltransferase, and its downstream effectors Sirt1 and Cebpa, Cebpb, Cebpe.\n\n We assessed the effect of nicotinamide on the production of nitric oxide during ventilator-induced lung injury.\n\n We also studied the effects of ventilator-induced lung injury in mice deficient in C/EBP?.\n\n\nResults\nNicotinamide treatment significantly inhibited neutrophil infiltration into the lungs during ventilator-induced lung injury, but did not affect protein leakage or cytokine production.\n\n Surprisingly, mice treated with nicotinamide developed significantly worse hypoxemia during mechanical ventilation.\n\n This effect was not linked to increases in nitric oxide production or alterations in expression of Nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase, Sirt1, or Cebpa and Cebpb.\n\n Cebpe mRNA levels were decreased with either nicotinamide treatment or mechanical ventilation, but mice lacking C/EBP? developed the same degree of hypoxemia and ventilator-induced lung injury as wild-type mice.\n\n\nConclusions\nNicotinamide treatment during VILI inhibits neutrophil infiltration of the lungs consistent with a strong anti-inflammatory effect, but paradoxically also leads to the development of significant hypoxemia.\n\n These findings suggest that pulmonary neutrophilia is not linked to hypoxemia in ventilator-induced lung injury, and that nicotinamide exacerbates hypoxemia during VILI.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4395431","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Heather

In this study, we aimed to further characterize the role of macrophage-derived EVs in immune responses against hepatitis C virus (HCV) and the potential of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) to modulate this modality of innate immunity.\n To this end, EVs were isolated from interferon-stimulated macrophage cultures or from serum of patients with acute or chronic hepatitis C.\n EVs were characterized by electron microscopy, flow cytometry, RNA-sequencing, and Western blot analysis.\n The effect of EVs on replication of HCV was assessed in coculture models.\n Functional analyses were performed to assess the impact of PUFAs on EV-mediated antiviral immunity.\n We found that macrophages secreted various cytokines shortly after stimulation with type I and II IFN, which orchestrated a fast but short-lasting antiviral state.\n This rapid innate immune answer was followed by the production of macrophage-derived EVs, which induced a late, but long-lasting inhibitory effect on HCV replication.\n Of note, exposure of macrophages to PUFAs, which are important regulators of immune responses, dampened EV-mediated antiviral immune responses.\n Finally, EVs from patients with hepatitis C exhibited long-lasting antiviral activities during IFN therapy as well.\n The antiviral effect of EVs from Caucasian and Japanese patients differed, which may be explained by different nutritional uptake of PUFAs.\n In conclusion, our data indicate that macrophage-derived EVs mediate long-lasting inhibitory effects on HCV replication, which may bridge the time until efficient adaptive immune responses are established, and which can be blunted by PUFAs.\n","id":"PMC5906748","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Frontiers Media

immunostimulatory activity that led to its application to diverse pathological conditions, including cancer.\n Studies in animal models and human patients have shown promising results in different types of malignancies, especially when T?1 was used in combination with other chemo- and immune therapies.\n For this reason, the advancements in our knowledge on the adjuvant role of T?1 have moved in parallel with the development of novel cancer therapies in a way that T?1 was integrated to changing paradigms and protocols, and tested for increased efficacy and safety.\n Cancer immunotherapy has recently experienced a tremendous boost following the development and clinical application of immune checkpoint inhibitors.\n By unleashing the full potential of the adaptive immune response, checkpoint inhibitors were expected to be very effective against tumors, but it soon became clear that a widespread and successful application was not straightforward and shortcomings in efficacy and safety clearly emerged.\n This scenario led to the development of novel concepts in immunotherapy and the design of combination protocols to overcome these limitations, thus opening up novel opportunities for T?1 application.\n Herein, we summarize in a historical perspective the use of T?1 in cancer, with particular reference to melanoma, hepatocellular carcinoma and lung cancer.\n We

entire genomic RNA and interacts with viron structural proteins, thus playing important roles in the process of virus particle assembly and release.\n Protein–protein interaction analysis using bioinformatics tools indicated that SARS_NP may bind to human cyclophilin A (hCypA), and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology revealed this binding with the equilibrium dissociation constant ranging from 6 to 160 nM.\n The probable binding sites of these two proteins were detected by modeling the three-dimensional structure of the SARS_NP–hCypA complex, from which the important interaction residue pairs between the proteins were deduced.\n Mutagenesis experiments were carried out for validating the binding model, whose correctness was assessed by the observed effects on the binding affinities between the proteins.\n The reliability of the binding sites derived by the molecular modeling was confirmed by the fact that the computationally predicted values of the relative free energies of the binding for SARS_NP (or hCypA) mutants to the wild-type hCypA (or SARS_NP) are in good agreement with the data determined by SPR.\n Such presently observed SARS_NP–hCypA

available against human and animal CoVs.\n Knowledge of host cell proteins that take part in pivotal virus-host interactions could define broad-spectrum antiviral targets.\n In this study, we used a systems biology approach employing a genome-wide yeast-two hybrid interaction screen to identify immunopilins (PPIA, PPIB, PPIH, PPIG, FKBP1A, FKBP1B) as interaction partners of the CoV non-structural protein 1 (Nsp1).\n These molecules modulate the Calcineurin/NFAT pathway that plays an important role in immune cell activation.\n Overexpression of NSP1 and infection with live SARS-CoV strongly increased signalling through the Calcineurin/NFAT pathway and enhanced the induction of interleukin 2, compatible with late-stage immunopathogenicity and long-term cytokine dysregulation as observed in severe SARS cases.\n Conversely, inhibition of cyclophilins by cyclosporine A (CspA) blocked the replication of CoVs of all genera, including SARS-CoV, human CoV-229E and -NL-63, feline CoV, as

Combined, the results indicate that GS-5734 interferes with the nsp12 polymerase even in the setting of intact ExoN proofreading activity and that resistance can be overcome with increased, nontoxic concentrations of GS-5734, further supporting the development of GS-5734 as a broad-spectrum therapeutic to protect against contemporary and emerging CoVs.\n","id":"PMC5844999","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"American Society for Microbiology","authors":[{"firstname":"Maria L.","surname":"Agostini","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Erica L.","surname":"Andres","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Amy C.","surname":"Sims","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rachel L.","surname":"Graham","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Timothy P.","surname":"Sheahan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaotao","surname":"Lu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Everett Clinton","surname":"Smith","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"James Brett","surname":"Case","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Joy Y.","surname":"Feng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Robert","surname":"Jordan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Adrian S.","surname":"Ray","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tomas","surname":"Cihlar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dustin","surname":"Siegel","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Richard L.","surname":"Mackman","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Michael O.","surname":"Clarke","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ralph S.","surname":"Baric","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mark R.","surname":"Denison","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kanta","surname":"Subbarao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kanta","surname":"Subbarao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2001191","date":"1970-01-01","title":"First Case of 2019 Novel Coronavirus in the United States","abstract":"An outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) that began in Wuhan, China, has spread rapidly, with cases now confirmed in multiple countries.\n We report the first case of 2019-nCoV infection confirmed in the United States and describe the identification, diagnosis, clinical course, and management of the case, including the patient’s initial mild symptoms at presentation with progression to pneumonia on day 9 of illness.\n This case highlights the importance of close coordination between clinicians and public health authorities at the local, state, and federal levels, as well as the need for rapid dissemination of clinical information related to the care of patients with this emerging infection.\n","id":"PMC7092802","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical Society","authors":[{"firstname":"Michelle L.","surname":"Holshue","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chas","surname":"DeBolt","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Scott","surname":"Lindquist","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kathy H.","surname":"Lofy","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"John","surname":"Wiesman","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hollianne","surname":"Bruce","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christopher","surname":"Spitters","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Keith","surname":"Ericson","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sara","surname":"Wilkerson","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ahmet","surname":"Tural","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"George","surname":"Diaz","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Amanda","surname":"Cohn","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"LeAnne","surname":"Fox","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Anita","surname":"Patel","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Susan I.","surname":"Gerber","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lindsay","surname":"Kim","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Suxiang","surname":"Tong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoyan","surname":"Lu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Steve","surname":"Lindstrom","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mark A.","surname":"Pallansch","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"William C.","surname":"Weldon","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Holly M.","surname":"Biggs","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Timothy M.","surname":"Uyeki","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Satish K.","surname":"Pillai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.2165/00003495-199856010-00013","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Nelfinavir.

IBV replicates not only in respiratory tissues (including the nose, trachea, lungs and airsacs, causing respiratory disease), but also in the kidney (associated with minor or major nephritis), oviduct, and in many parts of the alimentary tract—the oesophagus, proventriculus, duodenum, jejunum, bursa of Fabricius, caecal tonsils, rectum and cloaca, usually without clinical effects.\n The virus can persist, being re-excreted at the onset of egg laying (4 to 5 months of age), believed to be a consequence of the stress of coming into lay.\n Genetic lines of chickens differ in the extent to which IBV causes mortality in chicks, and in respect of clearance of the virus after the acute phase.\n Live attenuated (by passage in chicken embryonated eggs) IBV strains were introduced as vaccines in the 1950s, followed a couple of decades later by inactivated vaccines for boosting protection in egg-laying birds.\n Live vaccines are usually applied to meat-type chickens at 1 day of age.\n In experimental situations this can result in sterile immunity when challenged by virulent homologous virus.\n Although 100% of chickens may be protected (against clinical signs and loss of ciliary activity in trachea), sometimes 10% of vaccinated chicks may not respond with a protective immune response.\n Protection is short lived, the start of the decline being apparent 9 weeks after vaccination with vaccines based on highly attenuated strains.\n IBV exists as scores of serotypes (defined by the neutralization test), cross-protection often being poor.\n Consequently, chickens may be re-vaccinated, with the same or another serotype, two or three weeks later.\n Single applications of inactivated virus has generally led to protection of &lt;50% of chickens.\n Two applications have led to 90 to 100% protection in some reports, but remaining below 50% in others.\n In practice in the field, inactivated vaccines are used in laying birds that have previously been primed with two or three live attenuated virus vaccinations.\n This increases protection of the laying birds against egg production losses and induces a sustained level of serum antibody, which is passed to progeny.\n The large spike glycoprotein (S) comprises a carboxy-terminal S2 subunit (approximately 625 amino acid residues), which anchors S in the virus envelope, and an amino-terminal S1 subunit (approximately 520 residues), believed to largely form the distal bulbous part of S.\n The S1 subunit (purified from IBV virus, expressed using baculovirus or expressed in birds from a fowlpoxvirus vector) induced virus neutralizing antibody.\n Although protective immune responses were induced, multiple inoculations were required and the percentage of protected chickens was too low (&lt;50%) for commercial application.\n Remarkably, expression of S1 in birds using a non-pathogenic fowl adenovirus vector induced protection in 90% and 100% of chickens in two experiments.\n Differences of as little as 5% between the S1 sequences can result in poor cross-protection.\n Differences in S1 of 2 to 3% (10 to 15 amino acids) can change serotype, suggesting that a small number of epitopes are immunodominant with respect to neutralizing antibody.\n Initial studies of the role of the IBV nucleocapsid protein (N) in immunity suggested that immunization with bacterially expressed N, while not inducing protection directly, improved the induction of protection by a subsequent inoculation with inactivated IBV.\n In another study, two intramuscular immunizations of a plasmid expressing N induced protective immunity.\n The basis of immunity to IBV is not well understood.\n Serum antibody levels do not correlate with protection, although local antibody is believed to play a role.\n Adoptive transfer of IBV-infection-induced ?? T cells bearing CD8 antigen protected chicks from challenge infection.\n In conclusion, live attenuated IBV vaccines induce good, although short-lived, protection against homologous challenge, although a minority of individuals may respond poorly.\n Inactivated IBV vaccines are insufficiently efficacious when applied only once and in the absence of priming by live vaccine.\n Two applications of inactivated IBV are much more efficacious, although this is not a commercially viable proposition in the poultry industry.\n However, the cost and logistics of multiple application of a SARS inactivated vaccine would be more acceptable for the protection of human populations, especially if limited to targeted groups (e.\ng.\n health care workers and high-risk contacts).\n Application of a SARS vaccine is perhaps best limited to a minimal number of targeted individuals who can be monitored, as some vaccinated persons might, if infected by SARS coronavirus, become asymptomatic excretors of virus, thereby posing a risk to non-vaccinated people.\n Looking further into the future, the high efficacy of the fowl adenovirus vector expressing the IBV S1 subunit provides optimism for a live SARS vaccine, if that were deemed to be necessary, with the possibility of including the N protein gene.\n","id":"PMC7154303","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Taylor &amp; Francis","authors":[{"firstname":"Dave","surname":"Cavanagh","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.virol.2014.01.002","date":"2014-01-03","title":"Protection from SARS coronavirus conferred by live measles vaccine expressing the spike glycoprotein","abstract":"The recent identification of a novel human coronavirus responsible of a SARS-like illness in the Middle-East a decade after the SARS pandemic, demonstrates that reemergence of a SARS-like coronavirus from an animal reservoir remains a credible threat.\n Because SARS is contracted by aerosolized contamination of the respiratory tract, a vaccine inducing mucosal long-term protection would be an asset to control new epidemics.\n To this aim, we generated live attenuated recombinant measles vaccine (MV) candidates expressing either the membrane-anchored SARS-CoV spike (S) protein or its secreted soluble ectodomain (Ssol).\n In mice susceptible to measles virus, recombinant MV expressing the anchored full-length S induced the highest titers of neutralizing antibodies and fully protected immunized animals from intranasal infectious challenge with SARS-CoV.\n As compared to immunization with adjuvanted recombinant Ssol protein, recombinant MV induced stronger and Th1-biased responses, a hallmark of live attenuated viruses and a highly desirable feature for an antiviral vaccine.\n","id":"PMC7111909","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Inc.","authors":[{"firstname":"Nicolas","surname":"Escriou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Benoît","surname":"Callendret","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Valérie","surname":"Lorin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chantal","surname":"Combredet","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Philippe","surname":"Marianneau","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Michèle","surname":"Février","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Frédéric","surname":"Tangy","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.virol.2018.05.028","date":"2018-05-31","title":"Live-attenuated bivalent measles virus-derived vaccines targeting Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus induce robust and multifunctional T cell responses against both viruses in an appropriate mouse model","abstract":"Cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) continue to occur, making it one of the WHO´s targets for accelerated vaccine development.\n One vaccine candidate is based on live-attenuated measles virus (MV) vaccine encoding the MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein (MERS-S).\n MVvac2-MERS-S(H) induces robust humoral and cellular immunity against MERS-S mediating protection.\n Here, the induction and nature of immunity after vaccination with MVvac2-MERS-S(H) or novel MVvac2-MERS-N were further characterized.\n We focused on the necessity for vector replication and the nature of induced T cells, since functional CD8+ T cells contribute importantly to clearance of MERS-CoV.\n While no immunity against MERS-CoV or MV was detected in MV-susceptible mice after immunization with UV-inactivated virus, replication-competent MVvac2-MERS-S(H) triggered robust neutralizing antibody titers also in adult mice.\n Furthermore, a significant fraction of MERS CoV-specific CD8+ T cells and MV-specific CD4+ T cells simultaneously expressing IFN-?

thrombosis and microangiopathy in the small vessels and capillaries of the lungs, with associated haemorrhage, that significantly contributed to death.\n\n Features of diffuse alveolar damage, including hyaline membranes, were present, even in patients who had not been ventilated.\n\n Cardiac findings included individual cell necrosis without lymphocytic myocarditis.\n\n There was no evidence of secondary pulmonary infection by microorganisms.\n\n\nInterpretation\nWe identify key pathological states, including thrombotic and microangiopathic pathology in the lungs, that contributed to death in patients with severe COVID-19 and decompensation in this demographic.\n\n Management of these patients should include treatment to target these pathological mechanisms.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7255143","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Sharon

disease 2019 (Covid-19), have spread to millions of persons worldwide.\n\n Multiple vaccine candidates are under development, but no vaccine is currently available.\n\n Interim safety and immunogenicity data about the vaccine candidate BNT162b1 in younger adults have been reported previously from trials in Germany and the United States.\n\n\nMethods\nIn an ongoing, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded, dose-escalation, phase 1 trial conducted in the United States, we randomly assigned healthy adults 18 to 55 years of age and those 65 to 85 years of age to receive either placebo or one of two lipid nanoparticle–formulated, nucleoside-modified RNA vaccine candidates: BNT162b1, which encodes a secreted trimerized SARS-CoV-2 receptor–binding domain; or BNT162b2, which encodes a membrane-anchored SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike, stabilized in the prefusion conformation.\n\n The primary outcome was safety (e.\n\ng.\n\n, local and systemic reactions and adverse events); immunogenicity was a secondary outcome.\n\n Trial groups were defined according to vaccine candidate, age of the participants, and vaccine dose level (10 ?g, 20 ?g, 30 ?g, and 100 ?g).\n\n In all groups but one, participants received two doses, with a 21-day interval between doses; in one group (100 ?g of BNT162b1), participants received one dose.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 195 participants underwent randomization.\n\n In each of 13 groups of 15 participants, 12 participants received vaccine and 3 received placebo.\n\n BNT162b2 was associated with a lower incidence and severity of systemic reactions than BNT162b1, particularly in older adults.\n\n In both younger and older adults, the two vaccine candidates elicited similar dose-dependent SARS-CoV-2–neutralizing geometric mean titers, which were similar to or higher than the geometric mean titer of a panel of SARS-CoV-2 convalescent serum samples.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe safety and immunogenicity data from this U.\n\nS.\n\n phase 1 trial of two vaccine candidates in younger and older adults, added to earlier interim safety and immunogenicity data regarding BNT162b1 in younger adults from trials in Germany and the United

the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41

(one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.\n\n Increasing quartile of NLR was statistically significantly associated with secondary outcome.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR is associated with outcomes in unselected critically ill patients.\n\n In patients with sepsis, there was no statistically significant relationship between NLR and mortality.\n\n Further investigation is required to increase understanding of the

Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like

of neonates to bacterial infections has been attributed to immaturity of innate immunity.\n\n It is considered that one of the impaired mechanisms is the phagocytic function of neutrophils and monocytes.\n\n The purpose of the present study was to investigate the phagocytic ability of neonates at birth.\n\n\nMethods\nThe phagocytic ability of neutrophils and monocytes of 42 neonates was determined using the Phagotest flow cytometry method, that assesses the intake of E.\n\n Coli by phagocytes, in cord blood and in peripheral blood 3 days after birth.\n\n Fifteen healthy adults were included in the study as controls.\n\n\nResults\nThe phagocytic ability of neutrophils in the cord blood of neonates was significantly reduced compared to adults.\n\n The 3rd postnatal day the reduction of phagocytic ability of neutrophils was no longer significant compared to adults.\n\n The phagocytic ability of monocytes did not show any difference from that of adults either at birth or the 3rd postnatal day.\n\n\nConclusions\nOur findings indicate that the intake of E.\n\n Coli by phagocytes is impaired at birth in both preterm and full term neonates compared to adults.\n\n This defect is transient, with the phagocytic ability in neonates reaching that of the adults 3 days after birth.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3094219","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

Gene Transcription in Neonatal Dendritic Cells","abstract":"To gain insight into the inability of newborns to mount efficient Th1 responses, we analyzed the molecular basis of defective IL-12(p35) expression in human neonatal monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs).\n Determination of IL-12(p35) pre-mRNA levels by real-time RT-PCR revealed that transcriptional activation of the gene in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated neonatal DCs was strongly impaired compared with adult DCs.\n We next showed that p50/p65 and p65/p65 dimers interact with kB#1 site, a critical cis-acting element of the IL-12(p35) promoter.\n We found that LPS-induced p65 activation was similar in adult and newborn DCs.\n Likewise, in vitro binding activity to the Sp1#1 site, previously shown to be critical for IL-12(p35) gene activation, did not differ in adults and newborns.\n Since the accessibility to this Sp1#1 site was found to depend on nucleosome remodeling, we used a chromatin accessibility assay to compare remodeling of the relevant nucleosome (nuc-2) in adult and neonatal DCs.\n We observed that nuc-2 remodeling in neonatal DCs was profoundly impaired in response to lipopolysaccharide.\n Both nuc-2 remodeling and IL-12(p35) gene transcription were restored upon addition of recombinant interferon-?.\n We conclude that IL-12(p35) transcriptional repression in neonatal DCs takes place at the chromatin level.\n","id":"PMC2211877","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"The Rockefeller University

complex into the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) complex, which lowers the threshold of B cell activation and increases the survival and proliferative capacity of responding B cells.\n To investigate the role of the CD21–CD35 complement receptors in the generation of B cell memory, we analyzed the response against viral particles derived from the bacteriophage Q? in mice deficient in CD21–CD35 (Cr2?/?).\n Despite highly efficient induction of early antibody responses and germinal center (GC) reactions to immunization with Q?, Cr2?/? mice exhibited impaired antibody persistence paralleled by a strongly reduced development of bone marrow plasma cells.\n Surprisingly, antigen-specific memory B cells were essentially normal in these mice.\n In the absence of CD21-mediated costimulation, Q?-specific post-GC B cells failed to induce the transcriptional regulators Blimp-1 and XBP-1 driving plasma cell differentiation, and the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2, which resulted in failure to generate the precursor population of long-lived plasma cells residing in the bone marrow.\n These results suggest that complement receptors maintain antibody responses by delivery of differentiation

disease in animal models 8-14.\n However, the specificity of Th17 cells, the mechanism of their induction by distinct bacteria, and the means by which they foster tissue-specific inflammation remain

cells, but not other T cells, recognize antigens encoded by SFB.\n T cells with antigen receptors specific for SFB-encoded peptides differentiated into ROR?t-expressing Th17 cells, even if SFB-colonized mice also harbored a strong Th1 cell inducer, Listeria monocytogenes, in their intestine.\n The match of T cell effector function with antigen specificity is thus determined by the type

heterologous viruses","abstract":"Analyses of the relationships between different viruses and viral proteins have focused on homologies between linear amino acid sequences, but cross-reactivities at the level of T cell recognition may not be dependent on a conserved linear sequence of several amino acids.\n The CTL response to Pichinde virus (PV) and vaccinia virus (VV) in C57BL/6 mice previously immunized with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) included the reactivation of memory cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) specific to LCMV.\n Limiting dilution assays (LDA) demonstrated that at least part of this reactivation of memory cells in LCMV-immune mice related to cross-reactivity at the clonal level, even though acute infections with these viruses in nonimmune mice elicited CTL responses that did not cross-react in conventional bulk CTL assays.\n Precursor CTL (pCTL) to LCMV were generated in splenic leukocytes from LCMV-immune mice acutely infected with PV or VV when stimulated in vitro with only the second virus but not with uninfected peritoneal exudate cells (PECs).\n Cytotoxicity mediated by LCMV-specific CTL clones activated by PV infection was greatly inhibited by anti-CD8 antibody, suggesting that these memory CTL clones recognizing LCMV-infected targets were of low affinity.\n LCMV-immune splenocytes stimulated in vitro with PV or VV demonstrated a low but significant precursor frequency (p/f) to the heterologous viruses, and splenocytes from PV- or VV-immune mice when stimulated in vitro against LCMV generated a low but significant p/f to LCMV.\n Short-term CTL clones cross-reactive between LCMV and PV were derived from splenic leukocytes from LCMV-immune mice acutely infected with PV.\n To distinguish whether the cross-reactivity was directed against a viral peptide or a virus-induced endogenous cellular neoantigen, we demonstrated that a pCTL frequency to PV about 1/4-1/7 that of the frequency to LCMV could be generated from LCMV-immune splenic leukocytes stimulated with the immunodominant LCMV NP peptide.\n A partially homologous PV peptide generated from the equivalent site to the LCMV NP peptide did not sensitize targets to lysis by either LCMV- or PV-specific CTLs, suggesting that the cross-reactivity in killing was not due to evolutionarily conserved equivalent sequences.\n Experiments also indicated that prior immunity to one virus could modulate future primary immune responses to a second virus.\n Elevated pCTL frequencies to PV were seen after acute PV infection of LCMV- immune mice, and elevated pCTL frequencies to LCMV were seen after acute LCMV infection of PV- and VV-immune mice.\n(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","id":"PMC2191532","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"The Rockefeller University

severity, and consultation rates, is essential to inform future control and prevention.\n\n We aimed to compare the community burden and severity of seasonal and pandemic influenza across different age groups and study years and gain insight into the extent to which traditional surveillance underestimates this burden.\n\n\nMethods\nUsing preseason and postseason serology, weekly illness reporting, and RT-PCR identification of influenza from nasal swabs, we tracked the course of seasonal and pandemic influenza over five successive cohorts (England 2006–11; 5448 person-seasons' follow-up).\n\n We compared burden and severity of seasonal and pandemic strains.\n\n We weighted analyses to the age and regional structure of England to give nationally representative estimates.\n\n We compared symptom profiles over the first week of illness for different strains of PCR-confirmed influenza and non-influenza viruses using ordinal logistic regression with symptom severity grade as the outcome variable.\n\n\nFindings\nBased on four-fold titre rises in strain-specific serology, on average influenza infected 18% (95% CI 16–22) of unvaccinated people each winter.\n\n Of those infected there were 69 respiratory illnesses per 100 person-influenza-seasons compared with 44 per 100 in those not infected with influenza.\n\n The age-adjusted attributable rate of illness if infected was 23 illnesses per 100 person-seasons (13–34), suggesting most influenza infections are asymptomatic.\n\n 25% (18–35) of all people with serologically confirmed infections had PCR-confirmed disease.\n\n 17% (10–26) of people with PCR-confirmed influenza had medically attended illness.\n\n These figures did not differ significantly when comparing pandemic with seasonal influenza.\n\n Of PCR-confirmed cases, people infected with the 2009 pandemic strain had markedly less severe symptoms than those infected with seasonal H3N2.\nInterpretation\nSeasonal influenza and the 2009 pandemic strain were characterised by similar high rates of mainly asymptomatic infection with most symptomatic cases self-managing without medical consultation.\n\n In the community the 2009 pandemic strain caused milder symptoms than seasonal H3N2.\nFunding\nMedical Research Council and the Wellcome Trust.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7164821","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Hayward et al.

in circulation, occurs in both normal aging and autoimmune disease.\n The incidence of most autoimmune diseases increases with age, and premature CD4+ T cell aging has been reported in several autoimmune diseases.\n In this study, we tested the hypothesis that premature CD4+ T cell aging can cause autoimmune disease by examining whether premature CD4+ T cell aging exists and causes LIP in our mouse model.\n Non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice were used because, in addition to Treg defects, the LIP of T cells has been shown to plays a causative role in the development of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) in these mice.\n We found that with advancing age, NOD mice exhibited an accelerated decrease in the number of CD4+ T cells due to the loss of naïve cells.\n This was accompanied by an increase in the percentage of memory cells, leading to a reduced naïve/memory ratio.\n In addition, both the percentage of CD28+ cells in CD4+ T cells and IL-2 production decreased, while the percentage of FAS+CD44+ increased, suggesting that NOD mice exhibit premature CD4+ T cell aging.\n This process preferentially contributed to LIP of memory cells.\n Therefore, our results suggest that premature CD4+ T cell aging underlies the development of IDDM in NOD mice.\n Given that CD28 and IL-2 play important roles in Treg function, the relationships between premature CD4+ T cell aging and lymphopenia as well as Treg defects in autoimmune-prone NOD mice are proposed.\n","id":"PMC3935863","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

controversial as to how far this phenomenon contributes to the well-known age-associated increase in the occurrence of many cancers in the elderly.\n However, should the immune system be important in controlling cancer, for which there is a great deal of evidence, it is logical to propose that dysfunctional immunity in the elderly would contribute to compromised immunosurveillance and increased cancer occurrence.\n The chronological age at which immunosenescence becomes clinically important is known to be influenced by many factors, including the pathogen load to which individuals are exposed throughout life.\n It is proposed here that the cancer antigen load may have a similar effect on 'immune exhaustion' and that pathogen load and tumor load may act additively to accelerate immunosenescence.\n Understanding how and why immune responsiveness changes in humans as they age is essential for developing strategies to prevent or restore dysregulated immunity and assure healthy longevity, clearly possible only if cancer is avoided.\n Here, we provide an overview of the impact of age on human immune competence, emphasizing T-cell-dependent adaptive immunity, which is the most

How has it managed to spread from China to all around the world within 3 to 4 months? Li et al. used multiple sources to infer the proportion of early infections that went undetected and their contribution to virus spread. The researchers combined data from Tencent, one of the world's largest social media and technology companies, with a networked dynamic metapopulation model and Bayesian inference to analyze early spread within China. They estimate that ~86% of cases were undocumented before travel restrictions were put in place. Before travel restriction and personal isolation were implemented, the transmission rate of undocumented infections was a little more than half that of the known cases. However, because of their greater numbers, undocumented infections were the source for ~80% of the documented cases. Immediately after travel restrictions were imposed, ~65% of cases were documented. These findings help to explain the lightning-fast spread of this virus around the world.\nScience, this issue p. 489\nPrior to travel restrictions, most SARS-CoV-2 infections went undocumented and substantially contributed to global virus spread.\nEstimation of the prevalence and contagiousness of undocumented novel coronavirus [severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)] infections is critical for understanding the overall prevalence and pandemic potential of this disease. Here, we use observations of reported infection within China, in conjunction with mobility data, a networked dynamic metapopulation model, and Bayesian inference, to infer critical epidemiological characteristics associated with SARS-CoV-2, including the fraction of undocumented infections and their contagiousness. We estimate that 86% of all infections were undocumented [95% credible interval (CI): 82-90%] before the 23 January 2020 travel restrictions. The transmission rate of undocumented infections per person was 55% the transmission rate of documented infections (95% CI: 46-62%), yet, because of their greater numbers, undocumented infections were the source of 79% of the documented cases. These findings explain the rapid geographic spread of SARS-CoV-2 and indicate that containment of this virus will be particularly challenging.\nThe novel coronavirus that emerged in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), quickly spread to all Chinese provinces and, as of 1 March 2020, to 58 other countries. Efforts to contain the virus are ongoing; however, given the many uncertainties regarding pathogen transmissibility and virulence, the effectiveness of these efforts is unknown.\nThe fraction of undocumented but infectious cases is a critical epidemiological characteristic that modulates the pandemic potential of an emergent respiratory virus. These undocumented infections often go unrecognized owing to mild, limited, or lack of symptoms and thus, depending on their contagiousness and numbers, can expose a far greater portion of the population to the virus than would otherwise occur. Here, to assess the full epidemic potential of SARS-CoV-2, we use a model-inference framework to estimate the contagiousness and proportion of undocumented infections in China during the weeks before and after the shutdown of travel in and out of Wuhan.\nWe developed a mathematical model that simulates the spatiotemporal dynamics of infections among 375 Chinese cities (see supplementary materials). In the model, we divided infections into two classes: (i) documented infected individuals with symptoms severe enough to be confirmed, i.e., observed infections; and (ii) undocumented infected individuals. These two classes of infection have separate rates of transmission: beta, the transmission rate due to documented infected individuals; and mubeta, the transmission rate due to undocumented individuals, which is beta reduced by a factor mu.\nSpatial spread of SARS-CoV-2 across cities is captured by the daily number of people traveling from city j to city i and a multiplicative factor. Specifically, daily numbers of travelers between 375 Chinese cities during the Spring Festival period (&quot;Chunyun&quot;) were derived from human mobility data collected by the Tencent location-based service during the 2018 Chunyun period (1 February-12 March 2018). Chunyun is a period of 40 days:15 days before and 25 days after the Lunar New Year:during which there are high rates of travel within China. To estimate human mobility during the 2020 Chunyun period, which began 10 January, we aligned the 2018 Tencent data on the basis of relative timing to the Spring Festival. For example, we used mobility data from 1 February 2018 to represent human movement on 10 January 2020, as these days were similarly distant from the Lunar New Year. During the 2018 Chunyun, 1.73 billion travel events were captured in the Tencent data, whereas 2.97 billion trips were reported by the Ministry of Transport of the People's Republic of China. To compensate for underreporting and reconcile these two numbers, a travel multiplicative factor, theta, which is greater than 1, is included (see supplementary materials).\nTo infer SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics during the early stage of the outbreak, we simulated observations during 10-23 January 2020 (i.e., the period before the initiation of travel restrictions) (fig. S1) using an iterated filter-ensemble adjustment Kalman filter framework. With this combined model-inference system, we estimated the trajectories of four model state variables (Si, Ei, , and : the susceptible, exposed, documented infected, and undocumented infected subpopulations in city i, respectively) for each of the 375 cities, while simultaneously inferring six model parameters (Z, D, mu, beta, alpha, and theta: the average latency period, the average duration of infection, the transmission reduction factor for undocumented infections, the transmission rate for documented infections, the fraction of documented infections, and the travel multiplicative factor, respectively).\nDetails of model initialization, including the initial seeding of exposed and undocumented infections, are provided in the supplementary materials. To account for delays in infection confirmation, we also defined a time-to-event observation model using a gamma distribution (see supplementary materials). Specifically, for each new case in group , a reporting delay td (in days) was generated from a gamma distribution with a mean value of Td. In fitting both synthetic and the observed outbreaks, we performed simulations with the model-inference system using different fixed values of Td (6 days &lt;= Td &lt;= 10 days) and different maximum seeding, Seedmax (1500 &lt;= Seedmax &lt;= 2500) (see supplementary materials) (fig. S2). The best-fitting model-inference posterior was identified by log likelihood.\nValidation of the model-inference framework\nWe first tested the model-inference framework versus alternate model forms and using synthetic outbreaks generated by the model in free simulation. These tests verified the ability of the model-inference framework to accurately estimate all six target model parameters simultaneously (see supplementary methods and figs. S3 to S14). The system could identify a variety of parameter combinations and distinguish outbreaks generated with high alpha and low mu from those generated with low alpha and high mu. This parameter identifiability is facilitated by the assimilation of observed case data from multiple (375) cities into the model-inference system and the incorporation of human movement into the mathematical model structure (see supplementary methods and figs. S15 and S16).\nEpidemiological characteristics during 10-23 January 2020\nWe next applied the model-inference framework to the observed outbreak before the travel restrictions imposed on 23 January 2020:a total of 801 documented cases throughout China, as reported by 8 February. Figure 1, A to C, shows simulations of reported cases generated using the best-fitting model parameter estimates. The distribution of these stochastic simulations captures the range of observed cases well. In addition, the best-fitting model captures the spread of infections with the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to other cities in China (fig. S17). Our median estimate of the effective reproductive number, Re:equivalent to the basic reproductive number, R0, at the beginning of the epidemic:is 2.38 [95% credible interval (CI): 2.03-2.77], indicating that COVID-19 has a high capacity for sustained transmission (Table 1 and Fig. 1D). This finding aligns with other recent estimates of the reproductive number for this time period. In addition, the median estimates for the latency and infectious periods are ~3.69 and 3.47 days, respectively. We also find that, during 10-23 January, only 14% (95% CI: 10-18%) of total infections in China were reported. This estimate reveals a very high rate of undocumented infections: 86%. This finding is independently corroborated by the infection rate among foreign nationals evacuated from Wuhan (see supplementary materials). These undocumented infections are estimated to have been half as contagious per individual as reported infections (mu = 0.55; 95% CI: 0.46-0.62). Other model fittings made using alternate values of Td and Seedmax or different distributional assumptions produced similar parameter estimates (figs. S18 to S22), as did estimations made using an alternate model structure with separate average infectious periods for undocumented and documented infections (see supplementary methods, table S1). Further sensitivity testing indicated that alpha and mu are uniquely identifiable given the model structure and abundance of observations used (see supplementary methods and Fig. 1, E and F). In particular, Fig. 1F shows that the highest log-likelihood fittings are centered in the 95% CI estimates for alpha and mu and drop off with distance from the best-fitting solution (alpha = 0.14 and mu = 0.55).\nBest-fit model and sensitivity analysis.\nSimulation of daily reported cases in all cities (A), Wuhan city (B), and Hubei province (C).

Further, 86.2% (95% CI: 81.5-89.8%) of all infections originated from undocumented cases. Nationwide, the number of infections during 10-23 January was 16,829 (95% CI: 3797-30,271), with 86.2% (95% CI: 81.6-89.8%) originating from undocumented cases. To further examine the impact of contagious, undocumented COVID-19 infections on overall transmission and reported case counts, we generated a set of hypothetical outbreaks using the best-fitting parameter estimates but with mu = 0, i.e., the undocumented infections are no longer contagious (Fig. 2). We find that without transmission from undocumented cases, reported infections during 10-23 January are reduced by 78.8% across all of China and by 66.1% in Wuhan. Further, there are fewer cities with more than 10 cumulative documented cases: only one city with more than 10 documented cases versus the 10 observed by 23 January (Fig. 2C). This finding indicates that contagious, undocumented infections facilitated the geographic spread of SARS-CoV-2 within China.\nImpact of undocumented infections on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.\nSimulations generated using the parameters reported in Table 1 with mu = 0.55 (red) and mu = 0 (blue) showing daily documented cases in all cities (A), daily documented cases in Wuhan city (B), and the number of cities with &gt;=10cumulative documented cases (C). The box and whiskers show the median, interquartile range, and 95% CIs derived from 300 simulations.\nEpidemiological characteristics after 23 January 2020\nWe also modeled the transmission of COVID-19 in China after 23 January, when greater control measures were effected. These control measures included travel restrictions imposed between major cities and Wuhan, self-quarantine and contact precautions advocated by the government, and more available rapid testing for infection confirmation. These measures, along with changes in medical care-seeking behavior due to increased awareness of the virus and increased personal protective behavior (e.g., wearing of face masks, social distancing, self-isolation when sick), likely altered the epidemiological characteristics of the outbreak after 23 January. To quantify these differences, we reestimated the system parameters using the model-inference framework and city-level daily cases reported between 24 January and 8 February. Given that intercity mobility was restricted after 23 January, we tested two altered travel scenarios: (i) scenario 1: a 98% reduction of travel in and out of Wuhan and an 80% reduction in travel between all other cities, as indicated by changes in the Baidu mobility index (table S2); and (ii) scenario 2: a complete stoppage of intercity travel (i.e., theta to 0) (see supplementary methods for more details).\nThe results of inference for the 24 January-8 February period are presented in Table 2, figs. S23 to S26, and table S3. As control measures have continually shifted, we present estimates for both 24 January-3 February (period 1) and 24 January-8 February (period 2). For both periods, the best-fitting model for scenario 1 had a reduced reporting delay, Td, of 6 days (versus 9 days before 23 January), consistent with more rapid confirmation of infections. Estimates of both the latency and infectious periods were similar to those made for 10-23 January; however, alpha, beta, and Re all shifted considerably. The transmission rate of documented cases, beta, dropped to 0.52 (95% CI: 0.42-0.72) during period 1 and to 0.35 (95% CI: 0.28-0.45) during period 2, less than half the estimated transmission rate prior to travel restrictions (Table 2). The fraction of all infections that were documented, alpha, was estimated to be 0.65 (95% CI: 0.60-0.69), i.e., 65% of infections were documented during period 1, up from 14% before travel restrictions, and remained nearly the same for period 2. The reproductive number was 1.34 (95% CI: 1.10-1.67) during period 1 and 0.98 (95% CI: 0.83-1.16) during period 2, down from 2.38 prior to travel restrictions. While the estimate for the relative transmission rate, mu, is lower than before 23 January, the contagiousness of undocumented infections, represented by mubeta, was substantially reduced, possibly reflecting that only very mild, less contagious infections remain undocumented or that individual protective behavior and contact precautions have proven effective. Similar parameter estimates are derived under scenario 2 (no travel at all) (table S3). These inference results for both periods 1 and 2 should be interpreted with caution, as care-seeking behavior and control measures were continually in flux at these times.\nBest-fit model posterior estimates of key epidemiological parameters for simulation of the model during 24 January-3 February and 24 January-8 February.\nSeedmax = 2000 on 10 January, Td = 9 days before 24 January, and Td = 6 days between 24 January and 8 February. Travel to and from Wuhan is reduced by 98%, and other intercity travel is reduced by 80%.\nParameter	24 January-3 February[Median (95% CIs)]	24 January-8 February[Median (95% CIs)]	 	Transmission rate (beta, days-1)	0.52 (0.42, 0.72)	0.35 (0.28, 0.45)	 	Relative transmission rate (mu)	0.50 (0.37, 0.69)	0.43 (0.31, 0.61)	 	Latency period (Z, days)	3.60 (3.41, 3.84)	3.42 (3.30, 3.65)	 	Infectious period (D, days)	3.14 (2.71, 3.72)	3.31 (2.96, 3.88)	 	Reporting rate (alpha)	0.65 (0.60, 0.69)	0.69 (0.65, 0.72)	 	Effective reproductive number (Re)	1.34 (1.10, 1.67)	0.98 (0.83, 1.16)	 	\nOutlook\nOverall, our findings indicate that a large proportion of COVID-19 infections were undocumented prior to the implementation of travel restrictions and other heightened control measures in China on 23 January and that a large proportion of the total force of infection was mediated through these undocumented infections (Table 1). This high proportion of undocumented infections, many of which were likely not severely symptomatic, appears to have facilitated the rapid spread of the virus throughout China. Indeed, suppression of the infectiousness of these undocumented cases in model simulations reduces the total number of documented cases and the overall spread of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 2). In addition, the best-fitting model has a reporting delay of 9 days from initial infectiousness to confirmation; in contrast, line-list data for the same 10-23 January period indicates an average 6.6-day delay from initial manifestation of symptoms to confirmation. This discrepancy suggests that presymptomatic shedding may be typical among documented infections. The relative timing of onset and peak of viremia and shedding versus onset and peak of symptoms has been shown to potentially affect outbreak control success.\nOur findings also indicate that a radical increase in the identification and isolation of currently undocumented infections would be needed to fully control SARS-CoV-2. Increased news coverage and awareness of the virus in the general population have likely already prompted increased rates of seeking medical care for respiratory symptoms. In addition, awareness among health care providers and public health officials and the availability of viral identification assays suggest that capacity for identifying previously missed infections has increased. Further, general population and government response efforts have increased the use of face masks, restricted travel, delayed school reopening, and isolated suspected persons, all of which could additionally slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2.\nCombined, these measures are expected to increase reporting rates, reduce the proportion of undocumented infections, and decrease the growth and spread of infection. Indeed, estimation of the epidemiological characteristics of the outbreak after 23 January in China indicates that government control efforts and population awareness have reduced the rate of virus spread (i.e., lower beta, mubeta, Re), increased the reporting rate, and lessened the burden on already overextended health care systems.\nThe situation on the ground in China is changing day to day. New travel restrictions and control measures are being imposed on populations in different cities, and these rapidly varying effects make certain estimation of the epidemiological characteristics for the outbreak difficult. Further, reporting inaccuracies and changing care-seeking behavior add another level of uncertainty to our estimations. Although the data and findings presented here indicate that travel restrictions and control measures have reduced SARS-CoV-2 transmission considerably, whether these controls are sufficient for reducing Re below 1 for the length of time needed to eliminate the disease locally and prevent a rebound outbreak once control measures are relaxed is unclear. Moreover, similar control measures and travel restrictions would have to be implemented outside China to prevent reintroduction of the virus.\nThe results for 10-23 January 2020 delineate the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 moving through a developed country, China, without major restrictions or control. These findings provide a baseline assessment of the fraction of undocumented infections and their relative infectiousness for such an environment. However, differences in control activity, viral surveillance and testing, and case definition and reporting would likely affect rates of infection documentation. Thus, the key findings, that 86% of infections went undocumented and that, per person, these undocumented infections were 55% as contagious as documented infections, could shift in other countries with different control, surveillance, and reporting practices.\nOur findings underscore the seriousness of SARS-CoV-2. The 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza virus also caused many mild cases, quickly spread globally, and eventually became endemic. Presently, there are four endemic coronavirus strains circulating in human populations (229E, HKU1, NL63, and OC43). If the novel coronavirus follows the pattern of 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza, it will also spread globally and become a fifth endemic coronavirus within the human population.\nSupplementary Materials\nReferences and Notes\nNational Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, Update on the novel coronavirus pneumonia outbreak; www.nhc.gov.cn/xcs/yqtb/list_gzbd.shtml.\nWorld Health Organization, Coronavirus disease (COVID-2019) situation reports; www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/.\nA familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: A study of a family cluster\nReal-time tentative assessment of the epidemiological characteristics of novel coronavirus infections in Wuhan, China, as at 22 January 2020\nA novel coronavirus emerging in China:Key questions for impact assessment\nRisk for transportation of 2019 novel coronavirus disease from Wuhan to other cities in China\nX.

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

and differences in SARS epidemiology in three populations with similar host and viral genotype.\n\n\nMethods\nWe present a comparative epidemiologic analysis of SARS, based on an integrated dataset with 3,336 SARS patients from Hong Kong, Beijing and Taiwan, epidemiological and clinical characteristics such as incubation, onset-to-admission, onset-to-discharge and onset-to-death periods, case

differences in CFRs between the three regions.\n\n\nResults\nAll three regions showed similar incubation periods and progressive shortening of the onset-to-admission interval through the epidemic.\n\n Adjusted for sex, health care worker status and nosocomial setting, older age was associated with a higher fatality, with adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 2.10 (95% confidence interval: 1.45, 3.04) for

determinants of primary, household, and nosocomial transmission","abstract":"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a lethal zoonosis that causes death in 35·7% of cases.\n As of Feb 28, 2018, 2182 cases of MERS-CoV infection (with 779 deaths) in 27 countries were reported to WHO worldwide, with most being reported in Saudi Arabia (1807 cases with 705 deaths).\n MERS-CoV features prominently in the WHO blueprint list of priority pathogens that threaten global health security.\n Although primary transmission of MERS-CoV to human beings is linked to exposure to dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius), the exact mode by which MERS-CoV infection is acquired remains undefined.\n Up to 50% of MERS-CoV cases in Saudi Arabia have been classified as secondary, occurring from human-to-human transmission through contact with asymptomatic or symptomatic individuals infected with MERS-CoV.\n Hospital outbreaks of MERS-CoV are a hallmark of MERS-CoV infection.\n The clinical features associated with MERS-CoV infection are not MERS-specific and are similar to other respiratory tract infections.\n Thus, the diagnosis of MERS can easily be missed, unless the doctor or health-care worker has a high degree of clinical awareness and the patient undergoes specific testing for MERS-CoV.\n The largest outbreak of MERS-CoV outside the Arabian Peninsula occurred in South Korea in May, 2015, resulting in 186 cases with 38 deaths.\n This outbreak was caused by a traveller with undiagnosed MERS-CoV infection who became ill after returning to Seoul from a trip to the Middle East.\n The traveller visited several health facilities in South Korea, transmitting the virus to many other individuals long before a diagnosis was made.\n With 10 million pilgrims

data: an application to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)","abstract":"For diseases with some level of associated mortality, the case fatality ratio measures the proportion of diseased individuals who die from the disease.\n In principle, it is straightforward to estimate this quantity from individual follow?up data that provides times from onset to death or recovery.\n In particular, in a competing risks context, the case fatality ratio is defined by the limiting value of the sub?distribution function, F\n1(t) = Pr(T ?t and J = 1), associated with death, as t ? ?, where T denotes the time from onset to death (J = 1) or recovery (J = 2).\n When censoring is present, however, estimation of F\n1(?) is complicated by the possibility of little information regarding the right tail of F\n1, requiring use of estimators of F\n1(t*) or F\n1(t\n*)/(F\n1(t\n*)+F\n2(t\n*)) where t\n* is large, with F\n2(t) = Pr(T ?t and J = 2) being the analogous sub?distribution function associated with recovery.\n With right censored data, the variability of such estimators increases as t\n* increases, suggesting the possibility of using estimators at lower values of t\n* where bias may be increased but overall mean squared error be smaller.\n These issues are investigated here for non?parametric estimators of F\n1 and F\n2.\n The ideas are illustrated on case fatality data for individuals infected with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Hong Kong in 2003.

Cases exported domestically were then estimated.\n\n We forecasted the national and global spread of 2019-nCoV, accounting for the effect of the metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan and surrounding cities, which began Jan 23–24, 2020. We used data on monthly flight bookings from the Official Aviation Guide and data on human mobility across more than 300 prefecture-level cities in mainland China from the Tencent database.\n\n Data on confirmed cases were obtained from the reports published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n Serial interval estimates were based on previous studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV).\n\n A susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered metapopulation model was used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China.\n\n The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credibile interval (CrI).\n\n\nFindings\nIn our baseline scenario, we estimated that the basic reproductive number for 2019-nCoV was 2·68 (95% CrI 2·47–2·86) and that 75?815 individuals (95% CrI 37?304–130?330) have been infected in Wuhan as of Jan 25, 2020. The epidemic doubling time was 6·4 days (95% CrI 5·8–7·1).\n\n We estimated that in the baseline scenario, Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen had imported 461 (95% CrI 227–805), 113 (57–193), 98 (49–168), 111 (56–191), and 80 (40–139) infections from Wuhan, respectively.\n\n If the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV were similar everywhere domestically and over time, we inferred that epidemics are already growing exponentially in multiple major cities of China with a lag time behind the Wuhan outbreak of about 1–2 weeks.\n\n\nInterpretation\nGiven that 2019-nCoV is no longer contained within Wuhan, other major Chinese cities are probably sustaining localised outbreaks.\n\n Large cities overseas with close transport links to China could also become outbreak epicentres, unless substantial public health interventions at both the population and personal levels are implemented immediately.\n\n Independent self-sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally could become inevitable because of substantial exportation of presymptomatic cases and in the absence of large-scale public health interventions.\n\n Preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be readied for quick deployment globally.\n\n\nFunding\nHealth and Medical Research Fund (Hong Kong, China).\n\n\n","id":"PMC7159271","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

Serological Study for the Prevalence of Anti-MERS Coronavirus Antibodies in High- and Low-Risk Groups in Qatar","abstract":"Infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) could be asymptomatic or cause mild influenza-like illness.\n Therefore, the prevalence of MERS-CoV infections in the general population could be underestimated, which necessitates active surveillance to determine the epidemiological importance of asymptomatic cases.\n The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of various serological assays and to estimate the seroprevalence of anti-MERS-CoV antibodies in high- and low-risk groups in Qatar.\n A total of 4858 samples were screened, including 4719 samples collected from healthy blood donors (BD) over a period of five years (2012-2016), 135 samples from baseline case contacts (CC) collected from individuals in close contact with three positive PCR-confirmed patients (CP), and four samples from MERS-CoV CP.\n Initial screening using anti-MERS-CoV IgG (IgG rS1-ELISA kit) revealed ten reactive samples from BD (10/4719, 0.21%), one from CC (1/135, 0.74%), and three from CP (3/4, 75%).\n Samples from CP but not from BD were also reactive by whole-virus anti-MERS-CoV IgG (n = 3/4) and IgM (n = 1/4) indirect immunefluorescent tests (IIFT) and pseudoparticle neutralization test (ppNT).\n The reactive sample from CC was also confirmed by ppNT.\n Surprisingly, one out of thirteen (7.7%) randomly selected IgG rS1-ELISA-negative BD samples from the initial screening was reactive by the IgM-IIFT (but not by the IgG-IIFT) and was subsequently confirmed by ppNT.\n All IgG rS1-ELISA-reactive samples from BD exhibited considerable reactivity to the four circulating human coronaviruses (HKU1, OC43, 229E, and NL63).\n Cross-reactivity with SARS was only reported for samples from CP using IgG and IgM-IIFT.\n In conclusion, we report a low prevalence of anti-MERS antibodies in the general population, which coincides with the low number of all reported cases by the time of our study (2017) in Qatar (n = 21).\n The false-positive results and the observed cross-reactivity between MERS-CoV and other circulating human coronavirus necessitate more detailed evaluation of available serological assays.\n","id":"PMC6398027","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Hindawi","authors":[{"firstname":"Reham

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7121484","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical

Im/migrant communities may be worst affected by lockdowns and restrictive measures, face less opportunity to physically distance or stay home sick within ‘essential’ jobs, and experience severe barriers to healthcare.\n\n Insufficient attention to experiences of racialized im/migrants in current pandemic responses globally highlights an urgent need to more fulsomely address unmet health needs through an anti-racist, equity-oriented lens.\n\n This commentary aims to highlight the need for public health and clinical training, research, and policy to thoughtfully prioritize im/migrant health equity during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\nMain text\nid='Par2'>Global pandemic responses have neglected im/migrants by continuing to ignore or insufficiently address inequities, exacerbating COVID transmission, xenophobia, and occupational injustice.\n\n Deaths, illness, stress, and other negative outcomes of the overlapping epidemics of COVID-19 and structural racism disproportionately borne by racialized im/migrants suggest the urgent need for action.\n\n As evidence mounts about how im/migrants have been left behind in times of crises, we need enhanced focus on health equity within COVID-19 research and interventions, including research that examines and pursues structural interventions necessary to mitigate these impacts, and that identifies patterns and harms of xenophobic policy, structural racism, and white supremacy in shaping im/migrant health outcomes.\n\n We must also strengthen anti-racist and equity-oriented curriculum within health education, and ensure sufficient attention to the needs of im/migrant communities within public health, clinical, and research training.\n\n\nConclusion\nid='Par3'>The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated and rendered more visible the deeply rooted health and social inequities faced by racialized im/migrants across diverse settings.\n\n We argue for a greater emphasis on equity-focused and anti-racist im/migrant health research, interventions, and training.\n\n Policymakers and practitioners must ensure that healthcare policies and practices do not exacerbate inequities, and instead meaningfully address unmet needs of communities, including racialized im/migrants.\n\n Ethical and respectful community engagement, commitment and collaboration with global, national, and local communities, policymakers, academics, and educators, as well as accountability across sectors, is critical.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7868891","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

and Development: A Theoretical Perspective<","abstract":"The debate on migration and development has swung back and forth like a pendulum, from developmentalist optimism in the 1950s and 1960s, to neo?Marxist pessimism over the 1970s and 1980s, towards more optimistic views in the 1990s and 2000s.\n This paper argues how such discursive shifts in the migration and development debate should be primarily seen as part of more general paradigm shifts in social and development theory.\n However, the classical opposition between pessimistic and optimistic views is challenged by empirical evidence pointing to the heterogeneity of migration impacts.\n By integrating and amending insights from the new economics of labor migration, livelihood perspectives in development studies and transnational perspectives in migration studies – which share several though as yet unobserved conceptual parallels – this paper elaborates the contours of a conceptual framework that simultaneously integrates agency and structure perspectives and is therefore able to account for the heterogeneous nature of migration?development interactions.\n The resulting perspective reveals the naivety of recent views celebrating migration as self?help development “from below”.\n These views are largely ideologically driven and shift the attention away from structural constraints and the vital role of states in shaping favorable conditions for positive development impacts of migration to occur.\n","id":"PMC4744987","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Blackwell Publishing

of 281 cities of China from 2011 to 2018, and MGWR model is used to discuss the driving factors affecting the development of urban resilience.\n It is found that: (1) The urban resilience and sub-resilience show a continuous decline in time, with no obvious sign of convergence, while the spatial agglomeration effect shows an increasing trend year by year.\n (2) The spatial heterogeneity of urban resilience is significant, with obvious distribution characteristics of “high in east and low in west”.\n Urban resilience in the east, the central and the west are quite different in terms of development structure and spatial correlation.\n The eastern region is dominated by the “three-core driving mode”, and the urban resilience shows a significant positive spatial correlation; the central area is a “rectangular structure”, which is also spatially positively correlated; The western region is a “pyramid structure” with significant negative spatial correlation.\n (3) The spatial heterogeneity of the driving factors is significant, and they have different impact scales on the urban resilience development.\n The market capacity is the largest impact intensity, while the infrastructure investment is the least impact intensity.\n On this basis, this paper explores the ways to improve urban resilience in China from different aspects, such as market, technology, finance and government.\n","id":"PMC7908263","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"Yu","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mengke","surname":"Zhu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qian","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yurong","surname":"Qiao","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Yurong","surname":"Qiao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Paul

In our basic scenario (R0 of 2·68), mobility reduction of 20–60% within the city had a notable effect on controlling COVID-19 spread: a flattening of the peak number of cases by 33% (95% UI 21–42) and delay to the peak number by 2 weeks with a 20% restriction, 66% (48–75) reduction and 4 week delay with a 40% restriction, and 91% (79–95) reduction and 14 week delay with a 60% restriction.\n\n The effects of mobility restriction were increased when combined with reductions of 25% or 50% in transmissibility of the virus.\n\n In specific analyses of mobility restrictions for individuals with symptomatic infections and for high-risk regions, these measures also had substantial effects on reducing the spread of COVID-19. For example, the peak of the epidemic was delayed by 2 weeks if the proportion of individuals with symptomatic infections who could move freely was maintained at 20%, and by 4 weeks if two high-risk regions were locked down.\n\n The simulation results were also affected by various transmission parameters.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur model shows the effects of various types and magnitudes of mobility restrictions on controlling COVID-19 outbreaks at the city level in Shenzhen, China.\n\n The model could help policy makers to establish the optimal combinations of mobility restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially to assess the potential positive effects of mobility restriction on public health in view of the potential negative economic and societal effects.\n\n\nFunding\nGuangdong Medical Science Fund, and National Natural Science Foundation of China.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7384783","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"The Author(s).

quantitative predictions on the effectiveness of different control measures.\n\n Here, we explain how substantial biases are introduced by two important, yet largely ignored, assumptions at the core of the vast majority of such models.\n\n\nMethods and Findings\nFirst, we use analytical methods to show that (i) ignoring the latent period or (ii) making the common assumption of exponentially distributed latent and infectious periods (when including the latent period) always results in underestimating the basic reproductive ratio of an infection from outbreak data.\n\n We then proceed to illustrate these points by fitting epidemic models to data from an influenza outbreak.\n\n Finally, we document how such unrealistic a priori assumptions concerning model structure give rise to systematically overoptimistic predictions on the outcome of potential management options.\n\n\nConclusion\nThis work aims to highlight that, when developing models for public health use, we need to pay careful attention to the intrinsic assumptions embedded within classical frameworks.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1181873","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

of filtering methods enable the recursive estimation of system state variables and inference of model parameters.\n These methods have found application in a range of disciplines and settings, including engineering design and forecasting, and, over the last two decades, have been applied to infectious disease epidemiology.\n For any system of interest, the ideal filter depends on the nonlinearity and complexity of the model to which it is applied, the quality and abundance of observations being entrained, and the ultimate application (e.\ng.\n forecast, parameter estimation, etc.\n).\n Here, we compare the performance of six state-of-the-art filter methods when used to model and forecast influenza activity.\n Three particle filters—a basic particle filter (PF) with resampling and regularization, maximum likelihood estimation via iterated filtering (MIF), and particle Markov chain Monte Carlo (pMCMC)—and three ensemble filters—the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), the ensemble adjustment Kalman filter (EAKF), and the rank histogram filter (RHF)—were used in conjunction with a humidity-forced susceptible-infectious-recovered-susceptible (SIRS) model and weekly estimates of influenza incidence.\n The modeling frameworks, first validated with synthetic influenza epidemic data, were then applied to fit and retrospectively forecast the historical incidence time series of seven influenza epidemics during 2003–2012, for 115 cities in the United States.\n Results suggest that when using the SIRS model the ensemble filters and the basic PF are more capable of faithfully recreating historical influenza incidence time series, while the MIF and pMCMC do not perform as well for multimodal outbreaks.\n For forecast of the week with the highest influenza activity, the accuracies of the six model-filter frameworks are comparable; the three particle filters perform slightly better predicting peaks 1–5 weeks in the future; the ensemble filters are more accurate predicting peaks in the past.\n","id":"PMC3998879","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

homotopy parameters, and by setting some of these parameters to extreme values we generate a set of eight nested, deterministic transmission models.\n In order to investigate hRSV transmission dynamics, we applied these models to incidence data from eight international locations.\n Seasonality is included as cyclic variation in transmission.\n Parameters associated with the natural history of the infection were assumed to be independent of geographic location, while others, such as those associated with seasonality, were assumed location specific.\n Models incorporating either of the two extreme assumptions for immunity (none or solid and lifelong) were unable to reproduce the observed dynamics.\n Model fits with either waning or partial immunity to disease or both were visually comparable.\n The best fitting structure was a lifelong partial immunity to both disease and infection.\n Observed patterns were reproduced by stochastic simulations using the parameter values

inference of model parameters.\n These methods have found application in a range of disciplines and settings, including engineering design and forecasting, and, over the last two decades, have been applied to infectious disease epidemiology.\n For any system of interest, the ideal filter depends on the nonlinearity and complexity of the model to which it is applied, the quality and abundance of observations being entrained, and the ultimate application (e.\ng.\n forecast, parameter estimation, etc.\n).\n Here, we compare the performance of six state-of-the-art filter methods when used to model and forecast influenza activity.\n Three particle filters—a basic particle filter (PF) with resampling and regularization, maximum likelihood estimation via iterated filtering (MIF), and particle Markov chain Monte Carlo (pMCMC)—and three ensemble filters—the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), the ensemble adjustment Kalman filter (EAKF), and the rank histogram filter (RHF)—were used in conjunction with a humidity-forced susceptible-infectious-recovered-susceptible (SIRS) model and weekly estimates of influenza incidence.\n The modeling frameworks, first validated with synthetic influenza epidemic data, were then applied to fit and retrospectively forecast the historical incidence time series of seven influenza epidemics during 2003–2012, for 115 cities in the United States.\n Results suggest that when using the SIRS model the ensemble filters and the basic PF are more capable of faithfully recreating historical influenza incidence time series, while the MIF and pMCMC do not perform as well for multimodal outbreaks.\n For forecast of the week with the highest influenza activity, the accuracies of the six model-filter frameworks are comparable; the three particle filters perform slightly better predicting peaks 1–5 weeks in the future; the ensemble filters are more accurate predicting peaks in the past.\n","id":"PMC3998879","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

reliable forecasts of a current or upcoming influenza epidemic’s behavior, policy makers can design and implement more effective countermeasures.\n This past year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention hosted the “Predict the Influenza Season Challenge”, with the task of predicting key epidemiological measures for the 2013–2014 U.\nS.\n influenza season with the help of digital surveillance data.\n We developed a framework for in-season forecasts of epidemics using a semiparametric Empirical Bayes framework, and applied it to predict the weekly percentage of outpatient doctors visits for influenza-like illness, and the season onset, duration, peak time, and peak height, with and without using Google Flu Trends data.\n Previous work on epidemic modeling has focused on developing mechanistic models of disease behavior and applying time series tools to explain historical data.\n However, tailoring these models to certain types of surveillance data can be challenging, and overly complex models with many parameters can compromise forecasting ability.\n Our approach instead produces possibilities for the epidemic curve of the season of interest using modified versions of data from previous seasons, allowing for reasonable variations in the timing, pace, and intensity of the seasonal epidemics, as well as noise in observations.\n Since the framework does not make strict domain-specific assumptions, it can easily be applied to some other diseases with seasonal epidemics.\n This method produces a complete posterior distribution over epidemic curves, rather than, for example, solely point predictions of forecasting targets.\n We report prospective influenza-like-illness forecasts made for the 2013–2014 U.\nS.\n influenza season, and compare the framework’s cross-validated prediction error on historical data to that of a variety of simpler baseline predictors.\n","id":"PMC4552841","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Logan

associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui Ming, Hui Hoy and Chow Sin Lan Charity Fund Limited, Marina Man-Wai Lee, the Hong Kong Hainan Commercial Association South China Microbiology Research Fund, Sanming Project of Medicine (Shenzhen), and High Level-Hospital Program (Guangdong Health Commission).\n\n\n","id":"PMC7159286","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Jasper Fuk-Woo","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shuofeng","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kin-Hang","surname":"Kok","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kelvin Kai-Wang","surname":"To","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hin","surname":"Chu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jin","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fanfan","surname":"Xing","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jieling","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Cyril Chik-Yan","surname":"Yip","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rosana Wing-Shan","surname":"Poon","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hoi-Wah","surname":"Tsoi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Simon Kam-Fai","surname":"Lo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kwok-Hung","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Vincent Kwok-Man","surname":"Poon","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wan-Mui","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jonathan Daniel","surname":"Ip","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jian-Piao","surname":"Cai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Vincent Chi-Chung","surname":"Cheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Honglin","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christopher Kim-Ming","surname":"Hui","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kwok-Yung","surname":"Yuen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2001316","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Early Transmission Dynamics in Wuhan, China, of Novel Coronavirus–Infected Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nThe initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

international concern in view of its potential for further international spread.\n\n Decision makers worldwide are in need of empirical data to inform and implement emergency response measures.\n\n Our aim was to assess the potential for Ebola virus to spread across international borders via commercial air travel and assess the relative efficiency of exit versus entry screening of travellers at commercial airports.\n\n\nMethods\nWe analysed International Air Transport Association data for worldwide flight schedules between Sept 1, 2014, and Dec 31, 2014, and historic traveller flight itinerary data from 2013 to describe expected global population movements via commercial air travel out of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone.\n\n Coupled with Ebola virus surveillance data, we modelled the expected number of internationally exported Ebola virus infections, the potential effect of air travel restrictions, and the efficiency of airport-based traveller screening at international ports of entry and exit.\n\n We deemed individuals initiating travel from any domestic or international airport within these three countries to have possible exposure to Ebola virus.\n\n We deemed all other travellers to have no significant risk of exposure to Ebola virus.\n\n\nFindings\nBased on epidemic conditions and international flight restrictions to and from Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone as of Sept 1, 2014 (reductions in passenger seats by 51% for Liberia, 66% for Guinea, and 85% for Sierra Leone), our model projects 2·8 travellers infected with Ebola virus departing the above three countries via commercial flights, on average, every month.\n\n 91?547 (64%) of all air travellers departing Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone had expected destinations in low-income and lower-middle-income countries.\n\n Screening international travellers departing three airports would enable health assessments of all travellers at highest risk of exposure to Ebola virus infection.\n\n\nInterpretation\nDecision makers must carefully balance the potential harms from travel restrictions imposed on countries that have Ebola virus activity against any potential reductions in risk from Ebola virus importations.\n\n Exit screening of travellers at airports in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone would be the most efficient frontier at which to assess the health status of travellers at risk of Ebola virus exposure, however, this intervention might require international support to implement effectively.\n\n\nFunding\nCanadian Institutes of Health

the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n Cases have been exported to other Chinese cities, as well as internationally, threatening to trigger a global outbreak.\n\n Here, we provide an estimate of the size of the epidemic in Wuhan on the basis of the number of cases exported from Wuhan to cities outside mainland China and forecast the extent of the domestic and global public health risks of epidemics, accounting for social and non-pharmaceutical prevention interventions.\n\n\nMethods\nWe used data from Dec 31, 2019, to Jan 28, 2020, on the number of cases exported from Wuhan internationally (known days of symptom onset from Dec 25, 2019, to Jan 19, 2020) to infer the number of infections in Wuhan from Dec 1, 2019, to Jan 25, 2020. Cases exported domestically were then estimated.\n\n We forecasted the national and global spread of 2019-nCoV, accounting for the effect of the metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan and surrounding cities, which began Jan 23–24, 2020. We used data on monthly flight bookings from the Official Aviation Guide and data on human mobility across more than 300 prefecture-level cities in mainland China from the Tencent database.\n\n Data on confirmed cases were obtained from the reports published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n Serial interval estimates were based on previous studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV).\n\n A susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered metapopulation model was used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China.\n\n The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credibile interval (CrI).\n\n\nFindings\nIn our baseline scenario, we estimated that the basic reproductive number for 2019-nCoV was 2·68 (95% CrI 2·47–2·86) and that 75?815 individuals (95% CrI 37?304–130?330) have been infected in Wuhan as of Jan 25, 2020. The epidemic doubling time was 6·4 days (95% CrI 5·8–7·1).\n\n We estimated that in the baseline scenario, Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen had imported 461 (95% CrI 227–805), 113 (57–193), 98 (49–168), 111 (56–191), and 80 (40–139) infections from Wuhan, respectively.\n\n If the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV were similar everywhere domestically and over time, we inferred that epidemics are already growing exponentially in multiple major cities of China with a lag time behind the Wuhan outbreak of about 1–2 weeks.\n\n\nInterpretation\nGiven that 2019-nCoV is no longer contained within Wuhan, other major Chinese cities are probably sustaining localised outbreaks.\n\n Large cities overseas with close transport links to China could also become outbreak epicentres, unless substantial public health interventions at both the population and personal levels are implemented immediately.\n\n Independent self-sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally could become inevitable because of substantial exportation of presymptomatic cases and in the absence of large-scale public health interventions.\n\n Preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be readied for quick deployment globally.\n\n\nFunding\nHealth and Medical Research Fund (Hong Kong, China).\n\n\n","id":"PMC7159271","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Joseph T","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kathy","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gabriel M","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.4.2000057","date":"2020-01-30","title":"Novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) early-stage importation risk to Europe, January 2020","abstract":"As at 27 January 2020, 42 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) cases were confirmed outside China.\n We estimate the risk of case importation to Europe from affected areas in China via air travel.\n We consider travel restrictions in place, three reported cases in France, one in Germany.\n Estimated risk in Europe remains high.\n The United Kingdom, Germany and France are at highest risk.\n Importation from Beijing and Shanghai would lead to higher and widespread risk for Europe.\n","id":"PMC7001240","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC)","authors":[{"firstname":"Giulia","surname":"Pullano","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Francesco","surname":"Pinotti","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Eugenio","surname":"Valdano","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pierre-Yves","surname":"Boëlle","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chiara","surname":"Poletto","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Vittoria","surname":"Colizza","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]}]}]},{"doi":"10.1007/s12519-020-00354-4","date":"2020-03-02","title":"Clinical features of severe pediatric patients with coronavirus disease 2019 in Wuhan: a single center’s observational study","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in Wuhan, Hubei, China.\n\n People of all ages are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n No information on severe pediatric patients with COVID-19 has been reported.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical features of severe pediatric patients with COVID-19.\nMethods\nid='Par2'>We included eight severe or critically ill patients with COVID-19 who were treated at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), Wuhan Children’s Hospital from January 24 to February 24.

As of 24 February, more than 77,262 confirmed patients have been reported in China, and several patients have been confirmed in 29 countries. Among the confirmed patients in china, 9915 were severe patients and 2592 died. In addition, most of those who died had underlying health conditions such as hypertension, diabetes or cardiovascular disease which compromised their immune system.\nPrevious studies have shown that patients with COVID-19 present with fever, dry cough, dyspnea, fatigue and lymphopenia. SARS-CoV-2 is more likely to infect elderly adult men; and those with chronic comorbidities are at higher risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome and even death in severe patients. Infected children have relatively milder clinical symptoms compared with infected adults, and no deaths have been reported in the pediatric population up to now. Mildly affected pediatric patients have been reported with an age of onset ranging from 17 days to 17 years. However, specific information characterizing severely affected pediatric patients remains unknown.\nFor better understanding of the clinical features of severe pediatric patients with COVID-19 and for improving the diagnosis and treatment, we aimed to describe epidemiological and clinical features, imaging data, laboratory findings, clinical treatments and outcomes of severely or critically ill pediatric patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan City, China.\nMethods\nPatients\nWe included eight severely or critically ill patients with COVID-19 who were treated at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), Wuhan Children's Hospital from January 24 to February 24. COVID-19 was confirmed in all patients by positive results of real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for nasopharyngeal swab specimens. Clinical staging of the patients was classified according to &quot;Interim Guidance for Diagnosis and Treatment of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (the 6th edition)&quot; released by National Health Commission.\nSevere COVID-19 was defined when the pediatric patients met any of the following criteria: (1) increased respiratory rate: &gt;= 30 times/min; (2) oxygen saturation &lt; 93% under a resting state, and (3) arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2)/oxygen concentration (FiO2) &lt;= 300 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa).\nCritically ill COVID-19 was defined when the pediatric patients met any of the following criteria: (1) respiratory failure which requires mechanical ventilation; (2) septic shock, and (3) accompanied by other organ failure that needs ICU monitoring and treatment.\nData collection\nDemographic information and clinical characteristics including exposure history, anamnesis, signs and symptoms, chest computed tomographic (CT) scan or X-ray results, complications, treatments, clinical outcomes, and laboratory findings of each patient were obtained from the Electronic Medical Record System of Wuhan Children's Hospital. The dates of patients' disease onset and hospital admission, incubation period, days from illness onset to diagnosis confirmation, disease duration, as well as history of familial cluster were recorded.\nLaboratory tests were conducted upon admission, including a complete blood count (leucocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, thrombocyte, hemoglobin), serum biochemistry (C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, total bilirubin, creatine kinase, creatinine and D-dimer), TBNK test (CD16 + CD56 + CD3 +, CD4 + T, CD8 + T and Th/Ts), cytokine detection assays (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma) and identification of other respiratory pathogens such as influenza A virus (H1N1, H3N2, H7N9), influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus and adenovirus.\nResults\nDemographic and baseline characteristics\nDemographics, baseline characteristics and symptoms of eight pediatric patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)\nVariables	Patient 1	Patient 2	Patient 3	Patient 4	Patient 5	Patient 6	Patient 7	Patient 8	 	Characteristics	 	 Age	8 y	10 mon	1 y, 1 mon	2 mon	2 y, 1 mon	15 y	13 y, 11 mon	13 y, 5 mon	 	 Sex	Male	Female	Male	Male	Male	Female	Male	Male	 	 Exposure history		Close contact with COVID-19 patient		Close contact with suspected COVID-19 patient		Close contact with COVID-19 patient	Close contact with COVID-19 patient	Close contact with COVID-19 patient	 	 Anamnesis	Acute lymphocytic leukemia	Lacrimal sac dredge			Pharyngitis				 	 Incubation period (d)	NA	7	NA	10	NA	NA	5	5	 	 Days from illness onset to diagnosis confirmation (d)	12	3	15	6	9	12	5	0	 	 Disease duration (d)	28+	20+	24	20	16	19	12	9+	 	 Familial cluster		Yes		Yes		Yes	Yes	Yes	 	 Severely/critically ill	Critically ill	Critically ill	Critically ill	Severe	Severe	Severe	Severe	Severe	 	Symptoms	 	 Fever	Yes		Yes		Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	 	 Cough	Yes	Yes		Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes		 	 Fatigue/myalgia						Yes			 	 Headache						Yes			 	 Expectoration	Yes	Yes		Yes				Yes	 	 Nausea/vomiting		Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes				 	 Diarrhea			Yes		Yes	Yes			 	 Constipation		Yes							 	 Polypnea	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	 	 Lung auscultation	Rales	Crackles	Crackles	Rales	Crackles	Rales	Rales	Rales	 	Chest CT/X-ray	 	 Unilateral pneumonia				Yes				Yes	 	 Bilateral pneumonia	Yes	Yes	Yes		Yes	Yes	Yes		 	 Imaging changes	Multiple patch-like shadows, GGO, &quot;white lung&quot; appearance	Multiple patch-like shadows, pleural effusion, GGO	Multiple patch-like shadows, GGO	Multiple patch-like shadows	Multiple patch-like	Multiple patch-like shadows, GGO	GGO	Multiple mottling, GGO	 	 Complications		Intussusception, toxic encephalopathy, status epilepticus, DIC, septic shock, MODS	Septic shock, MODS, Kidney stone, Hydronephrosis, Cardiac insufficiency, Coagulopathy	Hypoglobulinemia	Gastroenteritis				 	\nNA not available, COVID-19 coronavirus disease 2019, CT computed tomography, DIC disseminated intravascular coagulation, GGO ground-glass opacity, MODS multi-organ dysfunction syndrome\nEight pediatric patients with COVID-19 treated in ICU were included in this study. Among them, three were critically ill patients, and five severely ill. Six were males and two females. The age ranged from 2 months to 15 years (Table 1). Five patients were family-clustered cases and had a close contact history with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients; one was infected during hospitalization. The transmission way was still unclear in two patients. The incubation period of four patients ranged from 5 to 10 days. Duration from illness onset to disease confirmation of seven patients ranged from 3 to 15 days. One patient (patient 8) who had a close contact history with infected patients was confirmed by RT-PCR test before symptoms appeared. Disease duration of all patients was over 10 days, and over 20 days in critically ill patients. All children were reported to be living in Wuhan during the outbreak period of COVID-19.\nClinical characteristics and chest imaging results\nIn the severe pediatric patients, the most common symptom was polypnea (8/8), followed by fever (6/8), cough (6/8), expectoration (4/8), nausea/vomiting (4/8), diarrhea (3/8), fatigue/myalgia (1/8), headache (1/8) and constipation (1/8) (Table 1). Lung auscultation revealed rales in the left or right lower lobe in five patients (5/8) and crackles in the others (3/8).\nAll patients had remarkable abnormalities in chest (CT) scanning or X-ray (Table 1). Six patients had bilateral pneumonia and two unilateral pneumonia. Imaging changes included multiple patch-like shadows (7/8), ground-glass opacity (GGO) (6/8), pleural effusion (1/8) and &quot;white lung-like&quot; change (1/8). The followings were imaging results of three typical patients.\nChest x-rays and chest CTs of patient 1. a Multiple patch-like shadows (Jan. 31). b High density shadows and ground-glass opacity (Feb.13). c Brightness of lung decreased and &quot;white lung-like&quot; changes appeared (Feb. 23)\nPatient 1 was an 8-year-old boy, who was infected with COVID-19 when under blood transfusion for treating acute lymphoblastic leukemia during hospitalization. Chest CT demonstrated multiple patch-like shadows (January 31) and high density shadows and GGO (February 13). His condition deteriorated and chest X-rays demonstrated decreased brightness of the lung and &quot;white lung&quot; appearance on February 23 (Fig. 1).\nChest X-rays and chest CTs of patient 2. a Small dense shadows and pleural effusion (Feb. 4). b Ground-glass opacity and consolidation shadow (Feb. 9). c Lesions progress (Feb.12). d Chest X-rays obviously improved\nPatient 2 was a 10-month-old infant, who had a close contact with a critically ill COVID-19 patient (her mother). Chest CT demonstrated small dense shadows and pleural effusion on February 4, GGO and consolidation shadow on February 9, and lesions deteriorated on February 12. Chest X-rays obviously improved until February 22 (Fig. 2).\nChest CTs of patient 6. a Multiple patch-like shadows and ground-glass opacity in both lungs (Feb. 8). b Lesions obviously improved (Feb. 14)\nPatient 6 was a 15-year-old girl, who had a close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 patient. Chest CT demonstrated multiple patch-like shadows and GGO bilateral both lungs (February 14), which was obviously improved on February 18 (Fig. 3).\nSeptic shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) were the most common complications in critically ill patients. Patient 2 was complicated with septic shock, MODS, intussusception, toxic encephalopathy, status epilepticus and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Patient 3 was complicated with septic shock, MODS, kidney stone, hydronephrosis, cardiac insufficiency and coagulopathy. Patients 4 and 5 were complicated with hypoglobulinemia and gastroenteritis.\nLaboratory assessments\nLaboratory test results of eight pediatric patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)\nVariables	Patient 1	Patient 2	Patient 3	Patient 4	Patient 5	Patient 6	Patient 7	Patient 8	 	Leucocytes (x 109/L; normal range 3.85-10)	1.65	14.95	9.19	8.32	8.8	10.6	3.85	7.6	 	Neutrophils (x 109/L; normal range 1.08-5.8)	0.78	11.63	5.7	1.27	3.5	5.9	1.9	3.8	 	Lymphocytes (x 109/L; normal range 1.15-4)	0.69	1.96	2.7	6.41	3.6	4.04	1.7	2.8	 	Thrombocyte (x 109/L; normal range 100-320)	140	68	145	666	247	515	154	250	 	Hemoglobin (g/L; normal range 110-150)	83	90	103	111	123	150	159	136	 	C-reactive protein (mg/L; normal range 0-3)	6.48	57.9	103	0.75	27.02	1	9.9	0.5	 	Procalcitonin (ng/mL; normal range 0-0.05)	0.18	17.16	0.05	0.08	0.11	0.04	0.09	0.05	 	Lactate dehydrogenase (U/L; normal range 175-322)	394	888	282	891	471	370	209	187	 	Aspartate aminotransferase (U/L; normal range 21-72)	37	27	33	41	16	14	14	16	 	Alanine aminotransferase (U/L; normal range 15-46)	58	66	36	100	55	9	16	8	 	Total bilirubin (micromol/L; normal range 3-22)	11.8	20.4	16.5	12.4	5.3	7.8	8.1	8.1	 	Creatine kinase (U/L; normal range 30-170)	15	20,702	33	148	262	106	72	77	 	Creatinine (mumol/L; normal range 27-62)	27.1	43.4	21.3	15	24.8	64.5	58	72.1	 	D-dimer (mg/L FEU; normal range 0-0.55)	0.47	40.34	3.07				0.23	0.44	 	Other viruses	Influenza A virus								 	TBNK test	 	 CD16+CD56+ (%; normal range 7.92-33.99)	5.80	1.36	2.30	18.06	5.97	5.08	10.00	10.12	 	 CD3 +  (%; normal range 38.56-70.06)	92.60	58.78	65.80	61.85	66.68	70.22	71.30	62.22	 	 CD4 + T (%; normal range 14.21-36.99)	33.39	37.85	39.38	21.54	39.42	40.24	29.66	30.34	 	 CD8 + T (%; normal range 13.24-38.53)	58.15	20.17	24.01	24.30	24.60	26.47	37.73	30.29	 	 Th/Ts (normal range 0.96-2.05)	0.57	1.88	1.64	0.89	1.6	1.52	0.79	1	 	Cytokine detection assays	 	 IL-2 (pg/mL; normal range 0-11.4)	2.61	1.61	1.57	2.08	1.36		3.96	1.71	 	 IL-4 (pg/mL; normal range 0-12.9)	3.42	2.45	2.63	2.98	2.13		6.24	4.88	 	 IL-6 (pg/mL; normal range 0-20.9)	639.98	117.88	5.44	17.47	2.92		11.05	7.37	 	 IL-10 (pg/mL; normal range 0-5.9)	9.24	17.42	6.94	8.84	2.5		6.25	3.31	 	 TNF-alpha (pg/mL; normal range 0-5.9)	5.01	2.9	1.41	1.97	0.85		5.7	4.35	 	 IFN-gamma (pg/mL; normal range 0-17.3)	10.06	4.36	36.79	20.59	1.12		7.19	4.62	 	\nCOVID-19 was confirmed in all patients by RT-PCR. In this cohort (except patient 1 who had acute lymphocytic leukemia), leucocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, thrombocyte and hemoglobin counts were all normal or mildly increased (Table 2). Neutrophils, lymphocytes and hemoglobin were decreased in patient 1. Patient 1 was also infected with Influenza A virus. Increased C-reactive protein, procalcitonin and lactate dehydrogenase were found in five patients (5/8), and increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in four (4/8). Total bilirubin level in all patients was normal. Creatine kinase level decreased in one patient and increased in two; patient 2 had a far higher bilirubin level (20,702 U/L) than normal (normal range: 30-170 U/L). Creatinine level decreased in three patients and increased in two patients. Two patients (2/5) had high D-dimer level. TBNK lymphocyte subset analysis revealed decreased percentage of CD16 + CD56 + lymphocytes (4/8) and Th/Ts (1/8), and increased percentage of CD3 + (2/8), CD4 + (4/8) and CD8 + (1/8) lymphocytes. Cytokine detection assays showed increased levels of IL-6 (2/8), IL-10 (5/8) and IFN-gamma (2/8).\nClinical treatment and outcomes\nClinical treatments and outcomes of eight pediatric patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)\nVariables	Patient 1	Patient 2	Patient 3	Patient 4	Patient 5	Patient 6	Patient 7	Patient 8	 	Oxygen therapy	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes			Yes	Yes	 	Mechanical ventilation (invasive)	Yes		Yes						 	Antibiotic treatment	Yes	Yes	Yes		Yes	Yes			 	Antiviral treatment	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	 	Glucocorticoids	Yes	Yes	Yes			Yes	Yes		 	Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy	Yes	Yes				Yes	Yes		 	Other treatments	Traditional Chinese medicine	Enterostomy, hemopurification, transfusions of red blood cell, plasma and thrombocyte	Plasmapheresis			Traditional Chinese medicine	Traditional Chinese medicine	Traditional Chinese medicine	 	Clinical outcome	Remained in ICU	Remained in ICU	Discharged	Discharged	Discharged	Discharged	Discharged	Remained in ICU	 	\nICU intensive care unit\nTreatments of COVID-19 remained focusing on symptomatic and respiratory supports (Table 3). Among the eight patients, six (6/8) received high-flow oxygen therapy and two critically ill (2/8) patients received mechanical ventilation. All patients received antiviral treatments (virazole, oseltamivir and interferon). Antibiotics, traditional Chinese medicine, intravenous glucocorticoids and immunoglobulin were also used dependent on patients' conditions. Symptomatic treatments were given for treating complications in patient 2 and 3. Up to February 24, 2020, three patients (patients 1, 2 and 8) remained in ICU (including two critically ill patients); the others recovered and were discharged home.\nDiscussion\nSince December, 2019, COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has spread rapidly around China and the world. SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus that belongs to the beta-coronavirus cluster, which can cause the third known zoonotic coronavirus disease after severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 uses the same cell entry receptor (ACE2) to infect humans, as SARS-CoV, but the clinical features of COVID-19 seem to be more variable. The number of COVID-19 patients currently exceeds SARS and MERS; however, most patients are infected mildly, and the overall case-fatality rate (CFR) was 2.3% (1023 deaths among 44,672 confirmed patients), much lower than that of SARS (10%) and MERS (37%).\nIn the early reports, all of the patients were adults (middle-aged and elderly) in Wuhan. On entering the outbreak stage and improvement of pathogen detection, pediatric patients (even newborns) have been reported increasingly. According to the latest report from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC), 965 confirmed patients under age 19 years (2.16%, 965/44,672) were reported nationwide; no deaths have occurred in the group aged 9 years and younger, as of February 11. Children have special immune response system which is distinct from adults; therefore, pediatric patients with COVID-19 have their own clinical features and therapeutic responses. To our knowledge, this is the first report on pediatric patients with severe COVID-19.\nThe patients age ranged from 2 months to 15 years, and mostly were males (75%). Males seemed to be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, which was similar to previous reports. Five patients (62.5%) were infected due to close contacts with family members confirmed with COVID-19; therefore, family daily prevention is an important way to prevent COVID-19. Disease duration is relative to the severity of the disease. Severely affected patients had a disease duration of over 10 days, but critically ill patients had a duration of over 20 days (two remained in ICU after over 20 days of treatment).\nIn our cohort, the most common symptoms were polypnea (100%), fever (75%), cough (75%), expectoration (50%) and nausea/vomiting (50%). Fatigue/myalgia and headache, commonly described in adults, were rarely described in children. The reason may be that these symptoms are difficult to be described by young children. Half of our patients were infants or young children, who were unable to speak or speak clearly. So more data on clinical features of pediatric patients need to be studied. The ratio of patients with fever in this cohort of severe patients was lower than that of critically ill adult patients. Among the 52 critically ill adult patients reported by Yang et al., common symptoms were fever (98%), cough (77%) and dyspnoea (63.5%). Nevertheless, the ratio of patients with fever in this series was higher than those children not treated in ICU. Among the 34 infected children (most are mild patients) reported by Wang et al., fever (50%) and cough (38%) were the most common symptoms. According to our results, polypnea should be highlighted in severe pediatric patients, even without fever.\nInfected patients who develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) may present with characteristic pulmonary ground-glass changes on imaging. The CT images of our patients mainly showed multiple patch-like shadows and ground glass opacity, consistent with previous reports. Chest X-rays of patient 1 who remains in ICU demonstrate decreased brightness of the lung and &quot;white lung-like&quot; changes. This patient is still under intensive treatment and close monitoring.\nSeptic shock and MODS were common complications in critically ill patients. Multi-organ involvements were found in critically ill patients including the nervous, blood, urinary and cardiac systems. Complications were relatively mild in severe patients in our cohort, such as hypoglobulinemia and gastroenteritis.\nThe treatment modalities of COVID-19 infection were mainly symptomatic and respiratory supporting. High-flow oxygen therapy, invasive ventilation and antiviral treatments (virazole, oseltamivir and interferon) were given to the patients. Antibiotic therapy, traditional Chinese medicine, intravenous glucocorticoid and immunoglobulin therapies were also used according to the patients' conditions. Up to February 24, 2020, three patients remained in ICU (including two critically ill patients), the others recovered and were discharged without death. The overall case fatality rate of severe pediatric patients is far lower than those of adults (49.0%, 1023/2087), which indicates a better clinical outcome in pediatric patients.\nLeucocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, thrombocyte and hemoglobin counts were normal or mildly increased in severe patients. Among critically ill patients, patient 1 with acute lymphocytic leukemia, undergoing blood transfusion, showed low level of neutrophils, lymphocytes and hemoglobin; patient 2 with serious complications (septic shock, DIC, MODS) showed high level of leucocytes and neutrophils and low level of thrombocyte and hemoglobin. Blood purification and transfusion were performed to improve symptoms. Elevated C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, procalcitonin, ALT and D-dimer were also discovered in the cohort. The level of creatine kinase was significantly high in patient 2, which required high attention.\nCoronaviruses of COVID-19, SARS and MERS can induce excessive and aberrant non-effective host immune responses that are associated with severe lung pathology. The lung injury is more pronounced in critically ill patients, associated with a cytokine storm, which is characterized by increased plasma concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-12, TNF, IFN-gamma) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-10, IL-13, TGF-beta). In our cohort, decreased CD16 + CD56+ lymphocytes and increased IL-6, IL-10 and IFN-gamma were observed. The levels of IL-6 and IL-10 were significantly increased in two critically ill patients, who remained in ICU with disease durations of over 20 days. More abnormalities in cytokine spectrum were seen in critically ill patients than in severe patients. Huang et al. also found that COVID-19 patients in ICU had higher plasma levels of IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF-alpha, compared with non-ICU patients. Conversely, severe SARS patients had very low levels of IL-10. Different inflammatory responses were found between SARS and COVID-19, so more researches are needed. In addition, the level of CD4 increased, which indicating overactivation of the immune system leading to fatal immune disorders.\nIn conclusion, for severe or critically ill pediatric patients who survive intensive care, a number of specific laboratory abnormalities and aberrant and excessive immune responses may lead to long-term lung damage and severe health complications. Therefore, early identification of the specific features of severe pediatric patients and timely treatment are of crucial importance.\nPublisher's Note\nSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.\nAuthor contributions\nDS and HL contributed equally to this paper.

between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.\n\n Increasing quartile of NLR was statistically significantly associated with secondary outcome.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR is associated with outcomes in unselected critically ill patients.\n\n In patients with sepsis, there was no statistically significant relationship between NLR and mortality.\n\n Further investigation is required to increase understanding of the pathophysiology of this relationship and to validate these findings with data collected prospectively.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article

a major threat to public health1–3.\n Despite intense research efforts, how, when and where new diseases appear are still a source of considerable uncertainty.\n A severe respiratory disease was recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China5.\n This outbreak highlights the ongoing ability of viral spill-over from animals to cause

coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China.\n\n We aimed to further clarify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data.\n\n Outcomes were followed up until Jan 25, 2020.\nFindings\nOf the 99 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, 49 (49%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market.\n\n The average age of the patients was 55·5 years (SD 13·1), including 67 men and 32 women.\n\n 2019-nCoV was detected in all patients by real-time RT-PCR.\n\n 50 (51%) patients had chronic diseases.\n\n Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (82 [83%] patients),

rhinorrhoea (four [4%] patients), chest pain (two [2%] patients), diarrhoea (two [2%] patients), and nausea and vomiting (one [1%] patient).\n\n According to imaging examination, 74 (75%) patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 14 (14%) patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity, and one (1%) patient had pneumothorax.\n\n 17 (17%) patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and, among them, 11 (11%) patients worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection was of clustering onset, is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n In general, characteristics of patients who died

the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui Ming, Hui Hoy and Chow Sin Lan Charity Fund Limited, Marina Man-Wai Lee, the Hong Kong Hainan Commercial Association South China Microbiology Research Fund, Sanming Project of Medicine (Shenzhen), and High Level-Hospital Program (Guangdong Health Commission).\n\n\n","id":"PMC7159286","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Jasper Fuk-Woo","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shuofeng","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kin-Hang","surname":"Kok","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kelvin Kai-Wang","surname":"To","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hin","surname":"Chu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jin","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fanfan","surname":"Xing","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jieling","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Cyril Chik-Yan","surname":"Yip","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rosana Wing-Shan","surname":"Poon","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hoi-Wah","surname":"Tsoi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Simon Kam-Fai","surname":"Lo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kwok-Hung","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Vincent Kwok-Man","surname":"Poon","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wan-Mui","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jonathan Daniel","surname":"Ip","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jian-Piao","surname":"Cai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Vincent Chi-Chung","surname":"Cheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Honglin","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christopher Kim-Ming","surname":"Hui","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kwok-Yung","surname":"Yuen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30211-7","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study","abstract":"Background\nIn December, 2019, a pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China.\n\n We aimed to further clarify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020.

abundantly immunolabeled for viral replicase subunits.\n However, double-stranded RNA, presumably revealing the site of viral RNA synthesis, mainly localized to the DMV interior.\n Since we could not discern a connection between DMV interior and cytosol, our analysis raises several questions about the mechanism of DMV formation and the actual site of SARS-CoV RNA synthesis.\n Our data document the extensive virus-induced reorganization of host cell membranes into a network that is used to organize viral replication and possibly hide replicating RNA from antiviral defense mechanisms.\n Together

Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

health emergency of international concern.\n The CoV spike (S) glycoprotein is a key target for urgently needed vaccines, therapeutic antibodies, and diagnostics.\n To facilitate medical countermeasure (MCM) development we determined a 3.5 Å-resolution cryo-EM structure of the 2019-nCoV S trimer in the prefusion conformation.\n The predominant state of the trimer has one of the three receptor-binding domains (RBDs) rotated up in a receptor-accessible conformation.\n We also show biophysical and structural evidence that the 2019-nCoV S binds ACE2 with higher affinity than SARS-CoV S.\n Additionally we tested several published SARS-CoV RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies and found that they do not have appreciable binding to nCoV-2019 S, suggesting antibody cross-reactivity may be limited between the two virus RBDs.\n The atomic-resolution structure of 2019-nCoV S should enable rapid development and evaluation of MCMs to address the ongoing public health crisis.\n","id":"PMC7217118","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Cold Spring Harbor

Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%)

admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in

of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7159299","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

countries for infection with SARSCoV, human metapneumovirus, and other respiratory pathogens.\n\n We infected four cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) with SARS-CoV in an attempt to replicate SARS and did necropsies on day 6 after infection.\n\n\nFindings\nSARS-CoV infection was diagnosed in 329 (75%) of 436 patients fitting the case definition of SARS; human metapneumovirus was diagnosed in 41 (12%) of 335, and other respiratory pathogens were diagnosed only sporadically.\n\n SARS-CoV was, therefore, the most likely causal agent of SARS.\n\n The four SARS-CoV-infected macaques excreted SARS-CoV from nose, mouth, and pharynx from 2 days after infection.\n\n Three of four macaques developed diffuse alveolar damage, similar to that in SARS patients, and characterised by epithelial necrosis, serosanguineous exudate, formation of hyaline membranes, type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia, and the presence of syncytia.\n\n SARS-CoV was detected in pneumonic areas by virus isolation and RT-PCR, and was localised to alveolar epithelial cells and syncytia by immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy.\n\n\nInterpretation\nReplication in SARS-CoV-infected macaques of pneumonia similar to that in human beings with SARS, combined with the high prevalence of SARS-CoV infection in SARS patients, fulfill the criteria required to prove that SARS-CoV is the

to bind the E protein PBM during SARS-CoV infection by using three complementary strategies, yeast two-hybrid, reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy assays.\n Syntenin redistributed

severe acute respiratory infection.\n\n We did diagnostic RT-PCR and indirect immunofluorescence.\n\n From time of diagnosis, respiratory, faecal, and urine samples were obtained for virus

Klinikum Schwabing on March 19, 2013, on day 11 of illness.\n\n He had been diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 2008, and had received several lines of treatment.\n\n The patient died on day 18, due to septic shock.\n\n MERS-CoV was detected in two samples of bronchoalveolar fluid.\n\n Viral loads were highest in samples from the lower respiratory tract (up to 1·2?×?106 copies per mL).\n\n Maximum

mRNA in monocytes prevented their accumulation in sites of inflammation.\n Specifically, the treatment attenuated their number in atherosclerotic plaques, reduced infarct size following coronary artery occlusion, prolonged normoglycemia in diabetic mice after pancreatic islet transplantation and resulted in reduced tumor volumes and lower numbers of tumor-associated macrophages.\n Taken together, siRNA nanoparticle-mediated CCR2 gene silencing in leukocytes selectively modulates functions of innate immune cell subtypes and may allow for the development of specific anti-inflammatory therapy.\n","id":"PMC3212614","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"NULL","authors":[{"firstname":"Florian","surname":"Leuschner","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Partha","surname":"Dutta","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rostic","surname":"Gorbatov","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tatiana

SARS coronavirus","abstract":"Background\nThe complex interplay between viral replication and host immune response during infection remains poorly understood.\n\n While many viruses are known to employ anti-immune strategies to facilitate their replication, highly pathogenic virus infections can also cause an excessive immune response that exacerbates, rather than reduces pathogenicity.\n\n To investigate this dichotomy in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), we developed a transcriptional network model of SARS-CoV infection in mice and used the model to prioritize candidate regulatory targets for further investigation.\n\n\nResults\nWe validated our predictions in 18 different knockout (KO) mouse strains, showing that network topology provides significant predictive power to identify genes that are important for viral infection.\n\n We identified a novel player in the immune response to virus infection, Kepi, an inhibitory subunit of the protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) complex, which protects against SARS-CoV pathogenesis.\n\n We also found that receptors for the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF?) promote pathogenesis, presumably through excessive inflammation.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe current study provides validation of network modeling approaches for identifying important players in virus infection pathogenesis, and a step forward in understanding the host response to an important infectious disease.\n\n The results presented here suggest the role of Kepi in the host response to SARS-CoV, as well as inflammatory activity driving pathogenesis through TNF? signaling in SARS-CoV infections.\n\n Though we have reported the utility of this approach in bacterial and cell culture studies previously, this is the first comprehensive study to confirm that network topology can be used to predict phenotypes in mice with experimental validation.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this
