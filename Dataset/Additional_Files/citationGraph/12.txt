One barrier to widespread testing has been a paucity of traditional respiratory viral swab collection kits relative to the demand. Whether other sample collection kits, such as widely available MRSA nasal swabs can be used to detect SARS-CoV-2 is unknown.\nMethods\nWe compared simultaneous nasal MRSA swabs (COPAN ESwabs   480C flocked nasal swab in 1mL of liquid Amies medium) and virals wabs (BD H192(07) flexible mini-tip flocked nasopharyngeal swabs in 3mL Universal Transport Medium) for SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing using Simplexa COVID-19 Direct assay on patients over a 4-day period. When the results were discordant, the viral swab sample was run again on the Cepheid Xpert Xpress   SARS-CoV-2 assay.\nResults\nOf the 81 included samples, there were 19 positives and 62 negatives in viral media and 18 positives and 63 negative in the MRSA swabs. Amongst all included samples, there was concordance between the COPAN ESwabs   480C and the viral swabs in 78 (96.3%).\nConclusion\nWe found a high rate of concordance in test results between COPAN ESwabs   480C in Amies solution and BD H192(07) nasopharyngeal swabs in in 3 mL of Universal Viral Transport medium viral media. Clinicians and laboratories should feel better informed and assured using COPAN ESwabs   480C to help in the diagnosis of COVID-19.\nIntroduction\nAs early as December 2019, a cluster of patients with pneumonia of unknown etiology was identified in Wuhan, China and shortly thereafter, the causative agent was identified as a novel betacoronavirus, the severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The spectrum of disease severity ranges from asymptomatic disease to severe pulmonary disease including acute respiratory distress syndrome, multisystem organ failure, and death. Genetic sequencing performed early in the course of the outbreak led to the development of diagnostic testing.\nWith testing, SARS-CoV-2 was noted to be responsible for a global pandemic, and as of April 27, 2020, a total of nearly 3 million cases worldwide have been diagnosed, and at least 207,000 have died from COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). Many experts have advocated for widespread testing. Due to the rapidity of and extensive spread of the infection however, many countries, including the United States, were ill-prepared to employ widespread testing as an effective public health tool. Limitations related to the availability of testing were complex, and occurred on many levels: first, various assays had to be developed and deployed, second, physical testing sites (including drive-through) had to be operationalized, and lastly supplies of ancillary equipment had to be obtained. Key to ancillary equipment was adequate and sustained supply of viral sample collection kits. Many healthcare systems that have overcome the first two of these barriers have been faced with unexpected shortages of swabs and transport media, compounded by slow or non-existent replacements and unreliable supply chains.\nAs with creative interventions to re-purpose personal protective equipment (PPE), healthcare systems have looked for ways to overcome barriers to testing. Interim guidelines issued by the CDC on April 14, 2020 clarified the allowance of other swab types with guidance on specimen collection and transport. In these guidelines, both FDA and CDC allowed for expansion of the specimen types and swab/transport media to accommodate demand for more testing. While nasopharyngeal specimens obtained with a &quot;mini-tip&quot; viral swab and transported in viral transport medium is still the preferred choice for initial testing, acceptable alternatives include nasopharyngeal aspirates and nasal washes as well as swabs of oropharynx, anterior nares, and nasal mid-turbinates. The latter two are only appropriate in symptomatic patients and both nares must be sampled. The anterior nares specimen should be collected using a spun polyester or flocked COPAN ESwabs  used for MRSA detection. These interim guidelines allow for anterior nares and mid-turbinate specimens to be transported in viral transport medium, Amies transport medium, or sterile saline. There is no data, however on the effect on diagnostic accuracy of SARS-CoV-2 tests based on these variable swabs and transport media used for specimen collection from sites other than the nasopharynx.\nGiven the wide availability of specimen collection kits used for MRSA testing in our facility, we sought to determine whether nasal MRSA swabs (flocked polyester COPAN ESwab  480C) and their transport medium (1mL of liquid Amies medium) can be used to detect SARS-CoV-2 when viral swabs are not available. We therefore sought to assess the concordance between the test results using these two different collection kits. This of paramount importance at this critical time.\nMethods\nNasal/nasopharyngeal swabs samples were obtained at the VA Connecticut Healthcare System from either symptomatic patients or patients with a high-risk exposure to COVID-19 presenting to a pre-scheduled &quot;drive-through&quot; outpatient testing center, its emergency department, as well as the inpatient and medical intensive care COVID-19 units over a four-day period. Hospitalized inpatients on the inpatient unit and medical intensive care unit had been initially diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 from one day to 24 days prior to re-testing.\nEach patient underwent concomitant testing with both a &quot;viral swab&quot; in Becton, Dickinson and Company H192(07) flexible fine-tip flocked nasopharyngeal swab, with 3 mL of Universal Viral Transport medium (Becton Dickinson H192(07) and an &quot;MRSA swab&quot; COPAN ESwab   480C with a flocked polyester nasal swab in 1mL of liquid Amies solution. Trained nurses or physicians collected the specimens. The viral swab specimens were nasopharyngeal; each MRSA swab specimen was collected by accessing a single nare, and extending the swab as far into the mid-turbinate area as the thickness of the swab would allow. After collection, specimens were stored at room temperature until received by the lab and subsequently at -20 degrees Celsius. All specimens were tested within 24 hours of collection. We found that the COPAN ESwab  was not compatible with the Roche Cobas 6800 machine due to the high concentration of mucus and particulate matter that is incompatible with that instrument's sampling apparatus. We therefore tested both samples with the Simplexa   COVID-19 Direct Kit (DiaSorin). This real-time RT-PCR assay used manufacturer-provided fluorescent probes with corresponding forward and reverse primers to target two regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, the S gene and ORF1ab. When the MRSA and viral swabs were discordant, the viral swab was run on the Xpert  Xpress SARS-CoV-2 (Cepheid). The protocol was considered a quality improvement project and granted exemption by the VA Connecticut Research Office and deemed that review by the VA Connecticut Investigational Review Board (IRB)or R&amp;D Committee was not needed since the objective was optimization of testing supplies. The VA Connecticut IRB provided written confirmation that IRB approval was not necessary. A waiver of informed consent was obtained from its Human Studies Subcommittee.\nResults\nWe sampled 81 unique patients, of which the viral swabs were positive for SARS-CoV-2 PCR on the DiaSorin test in 19. Of these samples, there were 19 positives and 62 negatives in viral media and 18 positives and 63 negatives in the MRSA collection kits (Fig 1). Amongst all included samples, there was concordance between the COPAN ESwabs   480C and the viral swabs in 78 (96.3%). In one patient the viral swab was negative and the COPAN ESwabs   positive and in two patients the viral swab was positive and the COPAN ESwabs   negative. When the results were discordant, the viral swab was re-tested with the Cepheid assay. When this was done, in two cases, the COPAN ESwab   480C result was concordant with the Cepheid platform. Concordance was achieved in one case because a negative result with the viral swab on the DiaSorin assay was presumptive positive on the Cepheid, and in the other case because a negative result on the DiaSorin with the COPAN ESwab  was positive with Cepheid.\nTest esults on the Simplexa   COVID-19 Direct Kit (DiaSorin) comparing viral swabs and MRSA swabs.\nDiscussion\nSARS-CoV-2 infection has overwhelmed healthcare systems internationally and caused unparalleled morbidity and mortality. Efforts to mitigate this infection focus on social distancing, widespread testing, home isolation, and timely implementation of precautions for hospitalized patients. In order to meet the need for diagnosis of COVID-19, several testing platforms have been approved by FDA, and several more may become available in the near future. Currently available reverse-transcriptase PCR tests that have been granted emergency use authorization from the FDA target specific genes of SARS-CoV2, and they are thought to provide relatively comparable and accurate results. However, like most other healthcare systems across the US, our healthcare system is experiencing a shortage of viral respiratory swabs and viral transport medium. While CDC and FDA have modified their sample collection guidelines to include specimens from nares and mid-turbinate using polyester flocked swabs transported in a variety of media, the effect of these on the diagnostic accuracy of the RT-PCR tests is not known. The concept of assessment of validity of SARS-CoV2 testing using COPAN ESwabs   480C was therefore born out of necessity.\nOur primary concerns were the anticipated mismatch in the site of sampling, and the concern about RNA-survival in the Amies solution. The COPAN Eswab  is thicker than the viral respiratory swab because the targeted site of sampling for MRSA is the anterior nares. This is in contrast to the respiratory viral swab, which has a flexible mini-tip and is designed to sample beyond the turbinates, to the nasopharyngeal wall, where the yield of respiratory viruses is typically higher since the local ciliated epithelial cells support viral replication, in contrast to the squamous epithelium of the anterior nares. The yield of SARS-CoV2 from anterior nares sampling has been expected to be inadequate analogous to influenza testing, but data are limited and contradictory.\nSimilarly, the Amies solution that accompanies the swabs for bacterial preservation does not contain any antimicrobial agent in order to prevent any compromise in the yield of bacterial genetic material. Instead, it contains salts to provide essential ions, inorganic phosphate to provide buffering, and sodium thioglycolate to provide reduced environment, meant to maintain viability of bacteria during transport. This, however, can be an undesirable medium for viral transport for that very reason. Abundant bacteria, when present, may commence a destructive effect on viral RNA almost immediately after sample collection. Time from specimen collection to receipt laboratory is therefore of utmost importance for such substitutions. To minimize such concerns we ensured that our samples were transported to the laboratory expeditiously, then frozen at -20 degrees Celsius to abort any bacterial activity. We find the high concordance rate between the swabs reassuring for reproducibility of this particular substitution.\nConcerns regarding SARS-CoV-2 RNA stability in liquid Amies, however, were recently addressed by Rogers et al. They found that SARS-CoV-2 RNA, when spiked into liquid Amies specimen remnants from COVID-19 negative patients, was stable for at least seven days at room temperature and at least 14 days when refrigerated. They did note an increase in cycle threshold values of about 2-3 after two weeks of frozen storage, but those changes did not alter result interpretations. Taken together, their results with ours support the suitability of ESwabs with liquid Amies for COVID-19 testing.\nIt is interesting to note that in two of the three cases when the results of the viral swab and COPAN ESwab   were discordant on the DiaSorin platform, the Cepheid platform gave concordant results. In both cases the concordance was achieved because the Cepheid obtained a positive result where the Diasorin had obtained a negative. This is perhaps related to the fact that the Cepheid interprets results as positive up to a cycle threshold value of 44, whereas the Diasorin's cut-off for positives is 40. A recent news report of unpublished data suggests that the DiaSorin test has a false-negative rate of nearly 11% and Cepheid a false negative result in 1.8%.\nAn unexpected finding was that the Ct values for detection of the ORF1ab sequence were significantly lower overall with the COPAN ESwab  than for the viral swab. Also, if it weren't for two outliers, the same would have been true for the Ct values for S gene detection. We speculate that this might be related to the fact that the tip of the COPAN ESwab  is larger than that of the viral swab, and might collect a larger sample with a larger viral load. This would be consistent with our anecdotal observation that specimens collected with the COPAN ESwab  contained more mucus. This finding could also be related to the fact that viral RNA concentration may be higher in the COPAN ESwab  specimens because the volume of liquid Amies transport medium is one third the volume of UTM used with the viral swab (1 mL versus 3 mL). At a minimum, we can conclude that the COPAN ESwab  with liquid Amies transport medium appears as sensitive for detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA as the viral swab in UTM.\nThere are several limitations to our study. Our sample size is both small and from one center, and needs to be confirmed in future larger studies including multiple centers with multiple technicians obtaining samples. Furthermore, we used two proprietary testing formulations. Whether this is generalizable to other formulations of viral and non-viral sampling systems is not known. Ideally, we would have liked to test each sample on multiple platforms looking for concordance between several testing modalities, as it is conceivable that inhibitory substances may be present in nasal materials or different transport media. However, due to the ongoing relative shortage of available reagents, we could not justify this for this quality improvement project.\nIn addition to its tremendous physical and emotional toll, infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 has stressed supply chains. While some may have used typical MRSA swabs when there have been shortages of viral swabs, heretofore there has been little evidence of their testing characteristics. We found a high rate of concordance in test results between COPAN ESwabs   480C in Amies solution and swabs in viral media. Clinicians and laboratories should feel better informed and assured that using COPAN ESwabs   480C to help in the diagnosis of COVID-19 is acceptable in resource-limited settings.\nSupporting information\nReferences\nChina novel coronavirus Investigating and Research Team.

(Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)\nReviewer #1: The manuscript entitled SARS-CoV-2 detection in setting of viral swab scarcity: are MRSA swabs and viral swabs equivalent? describes the use of MRSA swabs with Amies media and Viral swab with universal transport media for sample collection from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Authors indicated that the MRSA swabs yields the comparable results as that of viral swabs. However, this manuscript failed to address the following;\n1. Sample size is less\n2. Sampling was done at only one center; sampling in different screening center by different technicians will require to exclude personal variation in sample collection.\n3. As the Amies media is not known as medium of choice for sample collection for viral diagnosis and it is expected that the sample will be stored for varying time period at room temperature prior to transport to lab to store at -20C; the duration of stability of RNA in the Amies media must be tested prior to recommending them for SARS-CoV-2 sample collection.\n4. References not included for several sentences in the introduction; For example- &quot;The spectrum of disease severity ranges from asymptomatic disease to severe pulmonary disease including acute respiratory distress syndrome, multisystem organ failure, and death. Genetic sequencing performed early in the course of the outbreak led to the\ndevelopment of diagnostic testing&quot;.....include references.\n5. The following sentence is not clear and need to be re-written : We sampled 81 unique patients, of which the viral swabs were positive on the DiaSorin test in 19.\n6. It is needless to mention &quot;Additionally, while our study was conducted only in Veterans, we do not believe there\nshould be a difference in test results between Veterans and non-Veterans for the positive or\nnegative predictive value of testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection&quot;\n7. Under methods, the sentence &quot;virals wabs (BD H192(07) flexible mini-tip flocked &quot; need to be written as &quot;viral swabs (BD H192(07) flexible mini-tip flocked&quot;\n8. The very short and incomplete sentences [ for example &quot;The viral swab specimens were nasopharyngeal&quot; needs to be merged with neighboring sentence or can be re-written appropriately.\nReviewer #2: The tremendous need for swab test justifies the work by Daniel et.al. and this would for sure be helpful in terms of increasing the capacity to test. The manuscript is technically sound and the data support the conclusions. Although the sample number is small, the importance of work makes it acceptable.\nPercentage correlation of the positive and negative test of two different swabs together with results from Cepheid Xpert Xpress   SARS-CoV-2 assay justify the conclusions with appropriate control.\nMinor revisions: The authors should describe the primers used for the amplification of CoV2 RNA with details of the amplification conditions in the method section.\nThe manuscript is well written and acceptable with minor reversions.\n**********\n6.

binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development

familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China,

However, nasal specimens may have a slightly lower sensitivity than nasopharyngeal specimens. We herein validated an alternative procedure to collect nasal secretions with a swab routinely used in medical bacteriology for which there is no risk of supply disruption in order to perform the molecular diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nPatients who were suspected of having coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) attending the Hopital Europeen Georges Pompidou, Paris, France, were for their own care according to medical decision prospectively included and subjected to SARS-CoV-2 molecular testing using nasopharyngeal swab (Xpert nasopharyngeal sample collection kit; Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) and nasal swab (Copan Transystem; Copan, Brescia, Italy).\nNasal and nasopharyngeal swabs were inserted in the nostril until they hit an obstacle (the inferior concha and the back of the nasopharyngeal cavity, respectively), rotated five times, and removed. The test was conducted in only one nostril per patient. After sampling, the nasopharyngeal swab was inserted into a vial containing 3 ml of virus transport medium (Xpert viral transport medium; Cepheid), and the nasal swab was placed in a 15-ml tube containing 3 ml of saline solution (0.9% NaCl). SARS CoV-2 was detected using Allplex 2019-nCoV assay (Seegene, Seoul, Korea).\nA total of 44 patients were prospectively included up to the end of March 2020. Their median age was 63.0 years, ranging from 18 to 94 years. There were 23 (52.3%) male and 21 female patients. A total of 37 (84.1%) patients showed laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection using nasopharyngeal swab, with 7 patients giving negative results (15.9%) (Table 1).\nComparison of nasopharyngeal versus nasal sampling for SARS-CoV-2 detection by molecular biology\nNasopharyngeal sample/nasal	 	sample results	No. of samples (%)	 	Concordant results		 	    Positive/positive	33 (75.0)	 	    Negative/negative	7 (15.9)	 		 	Discordant results		 	    Positive/negativea	4 (9.1)	 		 	Total	44 (100.0)	 	\nOf the four samples with discordant results, two samples had very low viral loads (CT of 38 on the N gene).\nOut of 37 patients that were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal swab testing, 33 also tested positive by nasal sampling. All SARS-CoV-2-negative patients with nasopharyngeal swabs (n = 7) gave negative test results using nasal swabs (Table 1).\nBy reference to nasopharyngeal sampling, the detection of SARS-CoV-2 by nasal sampling provided 7 (15.9%) true SARS-CoV-2-negative specimens, 4 (9.1%) false-negative specimens, and 33 (75.0%) true SARS-CoV-2-positive specimens. Thus, the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection by multiplex real-time PCR from nasal secretions was 89.2% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 75.3 to 95.7), and its specificity was 100.0% (95% CI, 94.6 to 100.0). The kappa index was 0.72, indicating substantial concordance between nasal and nasopharyngeal swabbing to detect SARS-CoV-2 according to Landlis and Koch rank. The Youden J index was calculated at 89.2%, demonstrating good efficiency to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA.\nThreshold cycle (CT) (mean +- standard deviation [SD]) values for E (envelope), RdRP (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) and N (nucleocapsid) genes by nasopharyngeal (23.9 +- 4.9 for E, 26.3 +- 5.5 for RdRP, and 28.9 +- 6.1 for N) and nasal (22.3 +- 5.2 for E, 24.6 +- 5.9 for RdRP, and 27.9 +- 6.1 for N) swab testing were similar. Differences in CT values for the E, RdRP, and N genes were not statistically significant (P = 0.56, 0.84, and 0.57, respectively).\nWe herein report that the molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 using nasal swab specimens was nearly equivalent to the detection using nasopharyngeal swab considered the gold standard. SARS-CoV-2 detection from nasal samples showed high sensitivity and specificity. Agreement and accuracy of test results using nasal sampling by reference to gold standard nasopharyngeal sampling were estimated as substantial and good, respectively. Taken together, these observations demonstrate that nasal sampling could be used to screen SARS-CoV-2 in times of nasopharyngeal swab shortage.\nREFERENCES\nComparing nose-throat swabs and nasopharyngeal aspirates collected from children with symptoms for respiratory virus identification using real-time polymerase chain reaction\nDetection of multiple respiratory pathogens during primary respiratory infection: nasal swab versus nasopharyngeal aspirate using real-time polymerase chain reaction\n","References depth 1":[{"doi":"10.1542/peds.2008-0691","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Comparing nose-throat swabs and nasopharyngeal aspirates collected from children with symptoms for respiratory virus identification using real-time polymerase chain reaction","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[]},{"doi":"10.1007/s10096-009-0865-7","date":"2009-12-21","title":"Detection of multiple respiratory pathogens during primary respiratory infection: nasal swab versus nasopharyngeal aspirate using real-time polymerase chain reaction","abstract":"In this study, we present the multiple detection of respiratory viruses in infants during primary respiratory illness, investigate the sensitivity of nasal swabs and nasopharyngeal aspirates, and assess whether patient characteristics and viral load played a role in the sensitivity.\n Healthy infants were included at signs of first respiratory tract infection.\n Paired nasopharyngeal aspirates and nasal swabs were collected.\n Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out for 11 respiratory pathogens.\n Paired nasopharyngeal aspirates and nasal swabs were collected in 98 infants.\n Rhinovirus (n?=?67) and respiratory syncytial virus (n?=?39) were the most frequently detected.\n Co-infection occurred in 48% (n?=?45) of the infants.\n The sensitivity of the nasal swab was lower than the nasopharyngeal aspirate, in particular, for respiratory syncytial virus (51% vs.\n 100%) and rhinovirus (75% vs.\n 97%).\n The sensitivity of the nasal swab was strongly determined by the cycle threshold (CT) value (p?&lt;?0.001).\n The sensitivity of the swab for respiratory syncytial virus, but not rhinovirus, was 100% in children with severe symptoms (score ?11).\n It is concluded that, for community-based studies and surveillance purposes, the nasal swab can be used, though the sensitivity is lower than the aspirate, in particular, for the detection of mild cases of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection.\n","id":"PMC2840676","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Springer-Verlag","authors":[{"firstname":"T.

Testing guidelines for the SARS-CoV-2 virus required health care workers to collect a swab of the oropharynx (OP) or nasopharynx (NP). This potentially increased transmission risk to health care workers who lacked sufficient personal protective equipment (PPE) due to wide-spread shortages.\nIn other clinical experiences, obtaining a tongue, nasal, or mid-turbinate (MT) sample is faster, better tolerated, and causes less potential for sneezing, coughing, and gagging, than an NP swab. Additional recent evidence supports the validity of non-NP samples for SARS-CoV-2 detection. If also collected by the patient, such methods would reduce health care worker high-exposure and preserve limited PPE.\nWe enrolled over 500 individuals seen in any one of five ambulatory clinics in the Puget Sound, Washington region with symptoms indicative of upper respiratory infection. Participants were provided instructions and asked to self-collect tongue, nasal, and MT samples, in that order, followed by an NP sample collected by a health care worker. All samples were submitted for RT-PCR testing at a reference laboratory which yielded qualitative results (positive/negative) and Ct values report for positive samples only. See the on-line supplement for additional inclusion criteria, sampling methods, and statistical design.\nThe study was powered to a one-sided test to determine if the non-NP sensitivities were significantly greater than 90%. For 80% power, 48 NP positive patients were needed given an assumed true sensitivity of 98%. Pairwise analyses were conducted between each patient-collected sample and the health care worker-collected NP samples, which served as the comparator across all. Of the 501 patients with tongue and NP samples, 450 were negative by both swabs, 44 were positive by both swabs, 5 were NP positive and tongue negative, and 2 were tongue positive and NP negative. Of the 498 patients with nasal and NP samples, 447 were negative by both swabs, 47 were positive by both swabs, 3 were NP positive and nasal negative, and 1 was nasal positive and NP negative. Of the 504 patients with MT and NP samples, 452 were negative by both swabs, 50 were positive by both swabs, 2 were NP positive and MT negative, and 0 were MT positive and NP negative.\nUsing health care worker-collected NP samples as the comparator, estimated sensitivities of the patient-collected tongue, nasal, and MT samples and their one-sided 95% confidence intervals were 89.8% (80.2 - 100.0), 94.0% (84.6 - 100.0), and 96.2% (87.7 - 100.0), respectively. While the sensitivity of the nasal and MT samples were greater than 90%, none of the patient-sample sensitivities were statistically significant when tested using a one-sided test of proportions (p-values 0.50, 0.24, and 0.11 for tongue, nasal, and MT, respectively). Ct values from the RT-PCR demonstrated Pearson correlations of 0.48, 0.78, and 0.86 between the positive NP results and the positive tongue, nasal, and MT results, respectively. Panel A shows plots of the Ct values for the patient collected sites against the NP site, with a linear regression fit super-imposed on the scatterplot. For patients that tested positive by both the NP and one of the test location swabs, the Ct values for the tongue, nasal, and MT swabs were less than the NP Ct values 18.6%, 50.0%, and 83.3% of the time, respectively, indicating that viral load may be higher in MT than NP, and equivalent between nasal and NP. See the on-line supplement for additional results.\nThis work demonstrates the clinical utility of using patient-collected tongue, nasal, or MT sampling to health care worker-collect NP sampling for diagnosis of COVID-19. Adoption of patient-collected sampling techniques should help reduce PPE use, and provide a more comfortable patient experience. Our analysis was cross-sectional, in a single geographic region, and limited to single comparisons to NP. Despite these limitations, we believe that self-collected samples for SARS-CoV-2 testing from sites other than NP is a useful approach during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nPlots showing the Cycle Threshold (Ct) values of the tongue, nasal, and MT tests against\nthose of the comparator NP test.

Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.\n\n\nFindings\n191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital.\n\n 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients).\n\n Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·03–1·17, per year increase; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·61–12·23; p&lt;0·0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL (18·42, 2·64–128·55; p=0·0033) on admission.\n\n Median duration of viral shedding was 20·0 days (IQR 17·0–24·0) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors.\n\n The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage.\n\n Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.\n\n\nFunding\nChinese Academy of Medical Sciences Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences; National Science Grant for Distinguished Young Scholars; National Key

characterisation and epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and

We investigated three different transport conditions, including traditional viral transport media (VTM) and dry swabs, for each of two different nasal-swab collection protocols on a total of 308 study participants, and compared categorical results and Ct values to those from standard NP swabs collected at the same time from the same patients. All testing was performed by RT-PCR on the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 RealTime EUA (limit of detection [LoD], 100 copies viral genomic RNA/mL transport medium). We found high concordance (Cohen's kappa &gt;0.8) only for patients with viral loads above 1,000 copies/mL. Those with viral loads below 1,000 copies/mL, the majority in our cohort, exhibited low concordance (Cohen's kappa = 0.49); most of these would have been missed by nasal testing alone. Previous reports of high concordance may have resulted from use of assays with higher LoD (&gt;=1,000 copies/mL). These findings counsel caution in use of nasal testing in healthcare settings and contact-tracing efforts, as opposed to screening of asymptomatic, low-prevalence, low-risk populations. Nasal testing is an adjunct, not a replacement, for NP.\nIntroduction\nControlling the COVID-19 pandemic will require a massive expansion of testing for SARS-CoV-2 in several different clinical and epidemiological contexts. Until recently, nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs were the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) preferred specimen type, as these specimens were thought to provide the most robust detection of patient infection. However, there are conflicting reports as to which of several specimen types bear the highest viral load, and ultimately the &quot;preferred-specimen&quot; specification was removed from interim CDC guidance on 29 April 2020. Sensitivity is a complex issue, however, as detection in the upper airways (nasopharynx and oropharynx) is affected by multiple factors including duration of illness prior to testing as well as the limit of detection (LoD) of the RT-PCR assay used.\nAvailability of NP swabs and the resources to establish NP collection sites with specimen collection personnel have remained critical bottlenecks. To resolve these issues, healthcare systems have adopted multiple different strategies, including engaging industrial manufacturers to mass produce novel 3D-printed NP swabs, as well as evaluating different specimen types and alternative sample-collection strategies. Assessment of nasal swabs is a rapidly growing area of interest, specifically because this specimen type involves a less invasive procedure than NP swabs, as only the anterior-to-mid-turbinate area of the nasal passages is accessed. Accordingly, such samples can be self-collected by patients with a simple set of instructions, alleviating the need for highly trained medical personnel for specimen collection and reducing use of personal protective equipment (PPE) in short supply.\nMany of the US Food and Drug Administration Emergency Use Authorization (FDA EUA) RT-PCR assays have approval for use of nasal swabs as a specimen type, but how well nasal swabs perform compared to NP swabs remains unclear. To date, nasal-swab studies have shown conflicting results, with some researchers reporting similar test performance to NP swabs and others finding decreased sensitivity. Reconciling these differences is challenging, as these studies employed different sampling materials, collection methods, and RT-PCR assays. To address these conflicting reports, here we describe results of a six-arm, 308-subject study comparing two different healthcare-worker nasal-swab collection procedures and three different transport conditions, including in viral transport media (VTM) and dry transport. We discuss our findings in the context of prior reports (including preprints), to more systematically assess nasal-swab test performance and its potential role(s) in addressing diagnostic and epidemiologic needs in the COVID-19 pandemic.\nMaterials and Methods\nTrial design.\nParticipants were adults over 18 years of age tested for SARS-CoV-2 during the normal course of clinical care, based either on clinically suspected COVID-19 infection or follow-up after previous SARS-CoV-2-positive RT-PCR testing. Participants were asked to be swabbed twice, first with one of the nasal swabs under study (see below for swab-collection protocols) and then with a standard NP swab. To control for potential variability related to self-swabbing, sample collection was performed by trained nurses or respiratory-therapy staff (&quot;study staff&quot;) with training and oversight from the respiratory therapy department at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) drive-through/walk-up (&quot;drive-through&quot;) COVID-19 testing sites. Individuals with known thrombocytopenia (&lt;50,000 platelets/mul) were excluded from the study to avoid risk of bleeding. This study was reviewed and approved by BIDMC's institutional review board (IRB protocol no. 2020P000451).\nTransport conditions and swabs used.\nStandard nasal swabs were compared under three different specimen-transport conditions: (i) a guanidine thiocyanate (GITC) transport buffer, part of the Abbott multi-Collect Specimen Collection Kit, catalog no. 09K12-004; Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL), (ii) dry, with no buffer; and (iii) in modified CDC viral transport media (VTM) (Hank's balanced salt solution containing 2% heat inactivated FBS, 100mug/mL gentamicin, 0.5mug/mL fungizone, and 10mg/L Phenol red, produced by the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center [BIDMC] Clinical Microbiology Laboratories). The nasal swab used was the included Abbot swab for the GITC arm and the Hologic Aptima Multitest Swab otherwise (catalog no. AW-14334-001-003; Hologic Inc. Marlborough, MA). The NP swab used was the Copan BD ESwab collection and transport system swab (catalog no. 220532; Copan Diagnostics Inc., Murietta, CA).\nPCR compatibility.\nAlthough all swabs are routinely used for PCR testing, as a double-check each swab type was assessed for PCR compatibility by overnight incubation in 3 mL of modified CDC VTM (allowing potential PCR inhibitors time to leech into media), spiking 1.5 mL of media with 200 copies/mL of control SARS-CoV-2 amplicon target (twice the LoD of our system), vortexed, and tested using the Abbott RealTime SARS-CoV-2 Assay on an Abbott m2000 RealTime System platform, the assay and platform used for all testing in this report, following the same protocol used for clinical testing (see below). All swabs examined in this study passed this quality-control testing for lack of RT-PCR inhibition based on observation of Ct values within expected quality control limits.\nSwab collection protocols (Fig. 1).\nFor Procedure 1, for each naris, the swab tip was inserted into the nostril, the patient was told to press a finger against the exterior of that naris, and the swab was rotated against this external pressure for 10 seconds (Fig. 1a); this procedure was repeated with the same swab on the other naris, and then the swab was placed into the collection tube for transport to the laboratory for testing. For Procedure 2, the swab was inserted into the naris until resistance was felt, and the swab was then rotated for 15 seconds without external pressure (Fig. 1b); this procedure was repeated with the same swab on the other naris, and the swab was then placed into the collection tube for transport. The NP-swab sample was collected from a single naris by standard technique: insertion to appropriate depth, 10 rotations, removal, and placement into transport-media tube containing VTM. To maximize collection of material from the nares, in all cases sampling using the nasal swab (both nares) was performed first, before the NP swab.\nSample processing and testing.\nSamples were sent to the BIDMC Clinical Microbiology Laboratories for testing. Dry swabs were eluted in 2mL of Abbott mWash1 (100mM Tris with guanidinium isothiocyanate (GITC) and detergent). Swabs transported in GITC buffer were supplemented with 1mL of Abbott mWash1 solution to achieve minimum volume requirements for testing. Tests were performed with 1.5mL of sample media using the Abbott RealTime SARS-CoV-2 assay for EUA for use with nasopharyngeal and nasal swabs. This dual-target assay detects both the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) and N (nucleocapsid) genes with an in-lab verified LoD of 100 copies/mL.\nStatistical analyses.\nRT-PCR results reported categorically as either positive or negative, and these were used for concordance testing by Cohen's kappa.\nFor analyses based on cycle-threshold (Ct) values, for discordant samples (positive nasal-swab/negative NP-swab result or vice versa), the negative result was assigned a Ct value of 37, the total number of cycles run. Conversion to viral load was performed as described previously.\nWe tested whether Ct values for a given set of nasal swabs differed from the Ct values for the paired NP swabs (the controls) using Wilcoxon's paired t-test. This tested the null hypothesis that values for controls and prototypes are drawn from the same underlying distribution; p&gt;0.05 was interpreted as no difference. We used bootstrapping to test whether the n results for a given arm exhibited appreciable differences from others, specifically by testing whether a given arm differed from random samples from (i) results pooled across the three arms that used the same nasal-swab sampling procedure or (ii) all results. For each bootstrap test, we sampled n data points at random from the larger pool to create a synthetic dataset, calculating Cohen's kappa on this synthetic dataset, and repeating this process for 100,000 synthetic datasets to create a distribution (histogram) of kappa values; this distribution constitutes a null model of the kappa one would expect to observe by chance in a sample of n results, given the data in the larger pool. Using this distribution, we then calculated the probability of observing a kappa at least as high as the kappa actually observed for the n results from a given arm, to test for consistency with expectation; inconsistency (p&lt;0.05 or p&gt;0.95) would reject the null hypothesis that the study arm and the larger pool are statistically indistinguishable (as measured by kappa). For completeness, we performed the same bootstrap analysis to compare Procedure 1 results to all results and to compare Procedure 2 results to all results.\nWe used Python (v3.6-3.8) and its NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, and ct2vl libraries for the above analyses and related visualizations.\nLiterature review.\nWe searched Pubmed and the preprint servers bioRxiv and medRxiv through June 1, 2020 for all literature on nasal-swab sampling for SARS-CoV-2 and extracted sample sizes, collection methods, RT-PCR assay information, and 2x2 contingency table data comparing nasal swabs to NP swabs wherever available.\nResults\nTable 1 shows the numbers of patients tested in each of the six arms of our nasal- vs. NP-swab study. Visual inspection of plots of the Ct values of the nasal swab vs. NP-swab controls suggested worse performance for nasal swabs across all six arms, with no obvious differences between the two swab procedures or among the dry-swab, VTM, or GITC collection methods (Fig. 2). Statistical testing confirmed that results for each arm were indistinguishable from the overall results, supporting the functional equivalence of all swab/transport-condition combinations (Table 2). For concordant positives, comparison of Ct values between nasal and NP swabs showed higher Cts for nasal swabs than for NP swabs, suggesting slightly but consistently lower yield from the nasal swabs (Wilcoxon p=9x10-11). Consistent with this conclusion, there was a marked increase in false negatives for NP-swabs with higher Ct values (lower viral loads), resulting in low concordance overall (Cohen's kappa=0.49) (Fig. 2).\nOur overall finding of low concordance was in contrast to some previous reports, which have found nasal-swab collection to exhibit excellent sensitivity as well as Ct-value concordance , but was consistent with others, including, for example, one recent study at a New York, USA, hospital that also noted lower nasal-swab concordance for higher Ct values. Close review of these previous reports revealed that they differed in the type of specimen and/or result they used as a reference (e.g. any test-sample positive versus using NP swabs as the gold standard) and in the parameters they used in order to describe test performance (e.g. positive percent agreement versus sensitivity). To control for at least the latter, we extracted 2x2 contingency-table data from these reports to facilitate comparison to each other and to our own results (Table 3). Notably, many of these studies used a modified version of the CDC assay that did not report a LoD. Furthermore, of the studies that report the Ct values of their results, no viral-load conversion was provided, which is important since different RT-PCR assays and platforms have unique conversions between Ct value and viral load. Therefore, we were unable to systematically compare nasal-swab performance at low viral loads in these reports. These differences left open the possibility that inconsistent comparative performance of nasal-swab sampling might be explained largely by differences assay LoD, and possibly also by patient viral load. (We note that while the nasal-swab sampling protocols and transport media conditions varied between studies, our results suggest these differences are unlikely to affect detection).\nWe therefore revisited the trend we observed of a rise in nasal-swab-negative discordant results (false negatives) with higher Ct value. Recently we demonstrated that Ct values for the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay and platform used in the present study are reliable quantitative measures of viral load, and introduced a conversion from Ct value to viral load. Building on those findings, here we asked what the concordance would have been, for our nasal-vs.-NP data, had the LoD of our assay been higher than its actual 100 copies/mL. Specifically, we re-calculated kappa for different LoD cutoffs, and found that kappa rose steeply from ~0.5 (low concordance) to 0.8-0.9 (excellent concordance) as the LoD cutoff was increased from 100 copies/mL through 1,000 copies/mL and beyond (Fig. 3). This finding strongly supports the view that nasal swabs miss many if not most patients with low viral load (below ~1,000 copies/mL), but is reliable for patients with medium or high viral loads, potentially resolving disagreements among previous reports.\nDiscussion\nIt is widely acknowledged that resolving the damage that the COVID-19 pandemic has wrought to health, the economy, and society will require distributing and scaling up testing to unprecedented levels. For this reason, there is great and widespread interest in developing alternatives to NP-swab sampling for COVID-19 diagnosis. Governments and medical institutions alike have expressed interest in adopting nasal swabs as an alternative, as the self-administration of these swabs would allow vastly increased testing capacity, save PPE, and ease the burden on healthcare workers. Independently, the ability to transport swabs to testing locations without need of transport media such as VTM would further streamline testing processes. Reflecting this interest in nasal swabs, the US CDC has removed the &quot;preference&quot; specification for NP swabs from their interim guidance and note that nasal swabs are an acceptable alternative specimen as of 29 April 2020. However, confidence in population-scale testing strategies based on nasal swabs is complicated by conflicting reports as to how well they perform relative NP swabs, the antecedent gold standard, as we have described.\nOur results strongly suggest that concordance between nasal and NP swabs depends on the LoD of the PCR assay used to measure positivity, with high concordance for medium-to-high viral loads and low concordance for low viral loads, which may lie below the LoDs of various assays currently in widespread use (Fig. 3). We find that nasal swab samples reliably detect patients with viral loads &gt;=1,000 copies/mL but miss many patients who have lower viral loads, the majority in our study. A complete biological explanation will require further study; however, one possibility is that in cases of high viral load, replicating virus may be more likely to spread to respiratory epithelium bordering and/or in the deeper portions of the anterior nares, where it can be recovered by nasal swab.\nour findings may reconcile disagreements in prior reports, which have compared nasal swab performance only as a function of Ct values which are not comparable from study to study, not viral load, as we have done here,. We hypothesize that the outpatient/urgent care testing sites in these studies may have selected for patients early in the course of disease, when viral load is high. For example, one study that showed high concordance used an assay with a negative Ct cutoff of 40, and only a handful of patient samples had Ct values above 35. Although again the viral loads were not reported, the discrepancy between cutoff and Ct values suggested preferential sampling of patients with only high viral loads. (Note that a Ct value of 35 can correspond to different viral loads in different assays and the LoD of this assay was 4,167 copies/mL, over 40 times the cutoff in the assay we used.) Notably, the patient population in the present study consisted of both first-time and individuals with repeat testing for test of cure. Many of the latter have been observed to exhibit low-level viral load for multiple weeks in the absence of severe symptoms and enrichment of these patients may impact the overall performance of NP and nasal swabs in individual studies. In other studies, such differences may be more or less obscured depending on the limit of detection of the assay in use which may straddle the 1,000 copies/mL threshold we found for nasal swabs to consistently detect infection.\nInterestingly, we found no difference among transport media conditions and between sampling protocols, suggesting that lower sensitivity of nasal swab sampling is an overall limitation of the anatomical location of nasal swabs and that the protocols and media conditions we tested are interchangeable. Thus, for patients above a critical threshold of 1,000 copies/mL (Fig. 2), nasal swabs collected in VTM, GITC transport medium, and as dry swabs are all likely to perform equally well in the population, providing multiple potential options for specimen acquisition.\nOur results suggest several settings in which nasal swabs may and may not best be used. Peak infectiousness is likely to occur near or shortly before symptom onset and nasopharyngeal viral load is often undetectable a week after symptom onset. Lower-sensitivity testing would therefore likely miss patients with early developing presymptomatic infections and patients presenting multiple days after symptom onset. Notably, for those presenting later to care, a false-negative diagnosis could bear significant clinical implications in not only erroneously reassuring the patient and clinical team, but also excluding them from potentially useful and rationed therapies such as remdesivir or others. Importantly, based on viral load distribution in first-time tested individuals at our institution, ~20% of newly presenting SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals would be missed if sampled solely using nasal swabs, highlighting the potential magnitude of this problem.\nNevertheless, nasal swabs provide considerable advantage in terms of ease of collection and potential self-collection. Based on our results, they would serve best in high-test-volume, point prevalence screens in healthy populations, for example, in businesses and universities, where identification of highly infectious individuals will be a prelude to targeted testing with the most sensitive techniques possible to quell outbreaks and forestall local spread. Conversely, nasal swabs should not be used for screening symptomatic and especially hospitalized patients, where the more sensitive and resource intensive nasopharyngeal sampling would be justified, and help direct care and most appropriate use of infection control resources. In summary, whilst nasal swabs are a welcome addition to the armamentarium of tools needed to combat COVID-19, we should be well aware of possible limitations in diagnostic sensitivity and use this resource judiciously.\nSupplementary Material\nReferences\nEvaluating the accuracy of different respiratory specimens in the laboratory diagnosis and monitoring the viral shedding of 2019-nCoV infections\nVirological assessment of hospitalized patients with COVID-2019\nSaliva is more sensitive for SARS-CoV-2 detection in COVID-19 patients than nasopharyngeal swabs\nInformation for Laboratories about Coronavirus (COVID-19)\nChronological Changes of Viral Shedding in Adult Inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China\nSARS-CoV2 Testing: The Limit of Detection Matters\nOpen Development and Clinical Validation Of Multiple 3D-Printed Nasopharyngeal Collection Swabs: Rapid Resolution of a Critical COVID-19 Testing Bottleneck\nA combined oropharyngeal/nares swab is a suitable alternative to nasopharyngeal swabs for the detection of SARS-CoV-2\nComparison of Abbott ID Now, Diasorin Simplexa, and CDC FDA EUA methods for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal and nasal swabs from individuals diagnosed with COVID-19\nFeasibility of SARS-CoV-2 virus detection from consumer-grade cotton swabs\nSaliva as an Alternate Specimen Source for Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in Symptomatic Patients Using Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2\nSelf-Collected Oral Fluid and Nasal Swabs Demonstrate Comparable Sensitivity to Clinician Collected Nasopharyngeal Swabs for Covid-19 Detection\nSelf-collection: An appropriate alternative during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic\nSensitivity of Nasopharyngeal, Nasal and Throat Swab for the Detection of SARS-CoV-2\nSwabs Collected by Patients or Health Care Workers for SARS-CoV-2 Testing\nPerformance of the rapid Nucleic Acid Amplification by Abbott ID NOW COVID-19 in nasopharyngeal swabs transported in viral media and dry nasal swabs, in a New York City academic institution\nLarge-scale, in-house production of viral transport media to support SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing in a multi-hospital healthcare network during the COVID-19 pandemic\nInterrater reliability: the kappa statistic\nTemporal dynamics in viral shedding and transmissibility of COVID-19\nPresymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Infections and Transmission in a Skilled Nursing Facility\nRemdesivir in adults with severe COVID-19: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial\nNasal swabbing instructions\n(a), Procedure 1; (b), Procedure 2.

flow ventilation system to prevent airborne infection during exercise in the COVID-19 crisis: A single-center observational study","abstract":"Particulate generation occurs during exercise-induced exhalation, and research on this topic is scarce.\n Moreover, infection-control measures are inadequately implemented to avoid particulate generation.\n A laminar airflow ventilation system (LFVS) was developed to remove respiratory droplets released during treadmill exercise.\n This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the number of aerosols during training on a treadmill and exercise intensity and to elucidate the effect of the LFVS on aerosol removal during anaerobic exercise.\n In this single-center observational study, the exercise tests were performed on a treadmill at Running Science Lab in Japan on 20 healthy subjects (age: 29±12 years, men: 80%).\n The subjects had a broad spectrum of aerobic capacities and fitness levels, including athletes, and had no comorbidities.\n All of them received no medication.\n The exercise intensity was increased by 1-km/h increments until the heart rate reached 85% of the expected maximum rate and then maintained for 10 min.\n The first 10 subjects were analyzed to examine whether exercise increased the concentration of airborne particulates in the exhaled air.\n For the remaining 10 subjects, the LFVS was activated during constant-load exercise to compare the number of respiratory droplets before and after LFVS use.\n During exercise, a steady amount of particulates before the lactate threshold (LT) was followed by a significant and gradual increase in respiratory droplets after the LT, particularly during anaerobic exercise.\n Furthermore, respiratory droplets ?0.3 ?m significantly decreased after using LFVS (2120800±759700 vs.\n 560 ± 170, p&lt;0.001).\n The amount of respiratory droplets significantly increased after LT.\n The LFVS enabled a significant decrease in respiratory droplets during anaerobic exercise in healthy subjects.\n This study’s findings will aid in exercising safely during this pandemic.\n","id":"PMC8580245","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public

and air cleaning to limit aerosol particle concentrations in a gym during the COVID-19 pandemic","abstract":"SARS-CoV-2 can spread by close contact through large droplet spray and indirect contact via contaminated objects.\n There is mounting evidence that it can also be transmitted by inhalation of infected saliva aerosol particles.\n These particles are generated when breathing, talking, laughing, coughing or sneezing.\n It can be assumed that aerosol particle concentrations should be kept low in order to minimize the potential risk of airborne virus transmission.\n This paper presents measurements of aerosol particle concentrations in a gym, where saliva aerosol production is pronounced.\n 35 test persons performed physical exercise and aerosol particle concentrations, CO2 concentrations, air temperature and relative humidity were obtained in the room of 886 m³.\n A separate test was used to discriminate between human endogenous and exogenous aerosol particles.\n Aerosol particle removal by mechanical ventilation and mobile air cleaning units was measured.\n The gym test showed that ventilation with air-change rate ACH = 2.2 h?1, i.\ne.\n 4.5 times the minimum of the Dutch Building Code, was insufficient to stop the significant aerosol concentration rise over 30 min.\n Air cleaning alone with ACH = 1.39 h?1 had a similar effect as ventilation alone.\n Simplified mathematical models were engaged to provide further insight into ventilation, air cleaning and deposition.\n It was shown that combining the above-mentioned ventilation and air cleaning can reduce aerosol particle concentrations with 80 to 90% , depending on aerosol size.\n This combination of existing ventilation supplemented with air cleaning is energy efficient and can also be applied for other indoor environments.\n","id":"PMC7860965","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"The Authors.

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) broke out in Wuhan.\n\n Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported, but the relationships between laboratory features and viral load has not been comprehensively described.\n\n\nMethods\nAdult inpatients (?18 years old) with COVID-19 who underwent multiple (? 5 times) nucleic acid tests with nasal and pharyngeal swabs were recruited from Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, including general patients (n=70), severe patients (n=195) and critical patients (n=43).\n\n Laboratory data, demographic and clinical data were extracted from electronic medical records.\n\n The fitted polynomial curve was used to explore the association between serial viral loads and illness severity.\n\n\nResults\nViral load of SARS-CoV-2 peaked within the first few days (2-4 days) after admission, then decreased rapidly along with virus rebound under treatment.\n\n Critical patients had the highest viral loads, in contrast to the general patients showing the lowest viral loads.\n\n The viral loads were higher in sputum compared with nasal and pharyngeal swab (p=0.026).\n\n The positive rate of respiratory tract samples was significantly higher than that of gastrointestinal tract samples (p&lt;0.001).\n\n The SARS-CoV-2 viral load was negatively correlated with portion parameters of blood routine and lymphocyte subsets, and was positively associated with laboratory features of cardiovascular system.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe serial viral loads of patients revealed whole viral shedding during hospitalization and the resurgence of virus during the treatment, which could be used for early warning of illness severity, thus improve antiviral interventions.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7314240","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Oxford University

applications has contributed to their increased use on patients.\n\n This paper summarizes the literature on surgical 3D-printing applications used on patients, with a focus on reported clinical and economic outcomes.\n\n\nMethods\nThree major literature databases were screened for case series (more than three cases described in the same study) and trials of surgical applications of 3D printing in humans.\n\n\nResults\n227 surgical papers were analyzed and summarized using an evidence table.\n\n The papers described the use of 3D printing for surgical guides, anatomical models, and custom implants.\n\n 3D printing is used in multiple surgical domains, such as orthopedics, maxillofacial surgery, cranial surgery, and spinal surgery.\n\n In general, the advantages of 3D-printed parts are said to include reduced surgical time, improved medical outcome, and decreased radiation exposure.\n\n The costs of printing and additional scans generally increase the overall cost of the procedure.\n\n\nConclusion\n3D printing is well integrated in surgical practice and research.\n\n Applications vary from anatomical models mainly intended for surgical planning to surgical guides and implants.\n\n Our research suggests that there are several advantages to 3D-printed applications, but that further research is needed to determine whether the increased intervention costs can be balanced with the observable advantages of this new technology.\n\n There is a need for a formal cost–effectiveness analysis.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article

pathogen, tentatively named 2019-nCoV, within the Coronaviridae.\n Based on phylogeny, taxonomy and established practice, the CSG recognizes this virus as forming a sister clade to the prototype human and bat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs) of the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, and designates it as SARS-CoV-2. In order to facilitate communication, the CSG proposes to use the following naming convention for individual isolates: SARS-CoV-2/host/location/isolate/date.\n While the full spectrum of clinical manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections in humans remains to be determined, the independent zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 highlights the need for studying viruses at the species level to complement research focused on individual pathogenic viruses of immediate significance.\n This will improve our understanding of virus–host interactions in an ever-changing environment and enhance our preparedness for future outbreaks.\n","id":"PMC7095448","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing Group UK","authors":[{"firstname":"Alexander E.","surname":"Gorbalenya","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Susan C.","surname":"Baker","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ralph S.","surname":"Baric","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Raoul J.","surname":"de Groot","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christian","surname":"Drosten","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Anastasia A.","surname":"Gulyaeva","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bart L.","surname":"Haagmans","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chris","surname":"Lauber","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Andrey M.","surname":"Leontovich","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Benjamin W.","surname":"Neuman","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dmitry","surname":"Penzar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Stanley","surname":"Perlman","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Leo L.

SARS-CoV-2 Infections and Transmission in a Skilled Nursing Facility","abstract":"Background\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can spread rapidly within skilled nursing facilities.\n\n After identification of a case of Covid-19 in a skilled nursing facility, we assessed transmission and evaluated the adequacy of symptom-based screening to identify infections in residents.\n\n\nMethods\nWe conducted two serial point-prevalence surveys, 1 week apart, in which assenting residents of the facility underwent nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal testing for SARS-CoV-2, including real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), viral culture, and sequencing.\n\n Symptoms that had been present during the preceding 14 days were recorded.\n\n Asymptomatic residents who tested positive were reassessed 7 days later.\n\n Residents with SARS-CoV-2 infection were categorized as symptomatic with typical symptoms (fever, cough, or shortness of breath), symptomatic with only atypical symptoms, presymptomatic, or asymptomatic.\n\n\nResults\nTwenty-three days after the first positive test result in a resident at this skilled nursing facility, 57 of 89 residents (64%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Among 76 residents who participated in point-prevalence surveys, 48 (63%) tested positive.\n\n Of these 48 residents, 27 (56%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing; 24 subsequently developed symptoms (median time to onset, 4 days).\n\n Samples from these 24 presymptomatic residents had a median rRT-PCR cycle threshold value of 23.1, and viable virus was recovered from 17 residents.\n\n As of April 3, of the 57 residents with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 11 had been hospitalized (3 in the intensive care unit) and 15 had died (mortality, 26%).\n\n Of the 34 residents whose specimens were sequenced, 27 (79%) had sequences that fit into two clusters with a difference of one nucleotide.\n\n\nConclusions\nRapid and widespread transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was demonstrated in this skilled nursing facility.\n\n More than half of residents with positive test results were asymptomatic at the time of testing and most likely contributed to transmission.\n\n Infection-control strategies focused solely on symptomatic residents were not sufficient to prevent transmission after SARS-CoV-2 introduction into this facility.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7200056","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical Society","authors":[{"firstname":"Melissa

models for diagnosis and prognosis of covid-19: systematic review and critical appraisal","abstract":"Objective\nTo review and critically appraise published and preprint reports of prediction models for diagnosing coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) in patients with suspected infection, for prognosis of patients with covid-19, and for detecting people in the general population at increased risk of becoming infected with covid-19 or being admitted to hospital with the disease.\n\n\nDesign\nLiving systematic review and critical appraisal.\n\n\nData sources\nPubMed and Embase through Ovid, Arxiv, medRxiv, and bioRxiv up to 7 April 2020.\nStudy selection\nStudies that developed or validated a multivariable covid-19 related prediction model.\n\n\nData extraction\nAt least two authors independently extracted data using the CHARMS (critical appraisal and data extraction for systematic reviews of prediction modelling studies) checklist; risk of bias was assessed using PROBAST (prediction model risk of bias assessment tool).\n\n\nResults\n4909 titles were screened, and 51 studies describing 66 prediction models were included.\n\n The review identified three models for predicting hospital admission from pneumonia and other events (as proxy outcomes for covid-19 pneumonia) in the general population; 47 diagnostic models for detecting covid-19 (34 were based on medical imaging); and 16 prognostic models for predicting mortality risk, progression to severe disease, or length of hospital stay.\n\n The most frequently reported predictors of presence of covid-19 included age, body temperature, signs and symptoms, sex, blood pressure, and creatinine.\n\n The most frequently reported predictors of severe prognosis in patients with covid-19 included age and features derived from computed tomography scans.\n\n C index estimates ranged from 0.73 to 0.81 in prediction models for the general population, from 0.65 to more than 0.99 in diagnostic models, and from 0.85 to 0.99 in prognostic models.\n\n All models were rated at high or unclear risk of bias, mostly because of non-representative selection of control patients, exclusion of patients who had not experienced the event of interest by the end of the study, high risk of model overfitting, and vague reporting.\n\n Most reports did not include any description of the study population or intended use of the models, and calibration of the model predictions was rarely assessed.\n\n\nConclusion\nPrediction models for covid-19 are quickly entering the academic literature to support medical decision making at a time when they are urgently needed.\n\n This review indicates that proposed models are poorly reported, at high risk of bias, and their reported performance is probably optimistic.\n\n Hence, we do not recommend any of these reported prediction models to be used in current practice.\n\n Immediate sharing of well documented individual participant data from covid-19 studies and collaboration are urgently needed to develop more rigorous prediction models, and validate promising ones.\n\n The predictors identified in included models should be considered as candidate predictors for new models.\n\n Methodological guidance should be followed because unreliable predictions could cause more harm than benefit in guiding clinical decisions.\n\n Finally, studies should adhere to the TRIPOD (transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis) reporting guideline.\n\n\nSystematic review registration\nProtocol

Ebola Virus Disease","abstract":"Background\nDespite the notoriety of Ebola virus disease (EVD) as one of the world’s most deadly infections, EVD has a wide range of outcomes, where asymptomatic infection may be almost as common as fatality.\n\n With increasingly sensitive EVD diagnosis, there is a need for more accurate prognostic tools that objectively stratify clinical severity to better allocate limited resources and identify those most in need of intensive treatment.\n\n\nMethods/Principal Findings\nThis retrospective cohort study analyses the clinical characteristics of 158 EVD(+) patients at the GOAL-Mathaska Ebola Treatment Centre, Sierra Leone.\n\n The prognostic potential of each characteristic was assessed and incorporated into a statistically weighted disease score.\n\n The mortality rate among EVD(+) patients was 60.8% and highest in those aged &lt;5 or &gt;25 years (p&lt;0.05).\n\n Death was significantly associated with malaria co-infection (OR = 2.5, p = 0.01).\n\n However, this observation was abrogated after adjustment to Ebola viral load (p = 0.1), potentially indicating a pathologic synergy between the infections.\n\n Similarly, referral-time interacted with viral load, and adjustment revealed referral-time as a significant determinant of mortality, thus quantifying the benefits of early reporting as a 12% mortality risk reduction per day (p = 0.012).\n\n Disorientation was the strongest unadjusted predictor of death (OR = 13.1, p = 0.014) followed by hiccups, diarrhoea, conjunctivitis, dyspnoea and myalgia.\n\n Including these characteristics in multivariate prognostic scores, we obtained a 91% and 97% ability to discriminate death at or after triage respectively (area under ROC curve).\n\n\nConclusions/Significance\nThis study proposes highly predictive and easy-to-use prognostic tools, which stratify the risk of EVD mortality at or after EVD triage.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5289426","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

Review and Meta-analysis","abstract":"Objective\nTo estimate the prevalence of olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions (OGDs) among patients infected with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n\n\nMethods\nA systematic review was conducted by searching MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the preprint server MedRxiv from their inception until May 11, 2020, using the terms anosmia or hyposmia or dysosmia or olfactory dysfunction or olfaction disorder or smell dysfunction or ageusia or hypogeusia or dysgeusia or taste dysfunction or gustatory dysfunction or neurological and COVID-19 or 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV or SARS-CoV-2.\n\n The references of included studies were also manually screened.\n\n Only studies involving patients with diagnostic-confirmed COVID-19 infection were included.\n\n Random-effects meta-analysis was performed.\n\n\nResults\nTwenty-four studies with data from 8438 patients with test-confirmed COVID-19 infection from 13 countries were included.\n\n The pooled proportions of patients presenting with olfactory dysfunction and gustatory dysfunction were 41.0% (95% CI, 28.5% to 53.9%) and 38.2% (95% CI, 24.0% to 53.6%), respectively.\n\n Increasing mean age correlated with lower prevalence of olfactory (coefficient = ?0.076; P=.\n\n02) and gustatory (coefficient = ?0.073; P=.\n\n03) dysfunctions.\n\n There was a higher prevalence of olfactory dysfunctions with the use of objective measurements compared with self-reports (coefficient = 2.33; P=.\n\n01).\n\n No significant moderation of the prevalence of OGDs by sex was observed.\n\n\nConclusion\nThere is a high prevalence of OGDs among patients infected with COVID-19. Routine screening for these conditions could contribute to improved case detection in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n However, to better inform population screening measures, further studies are needed to establish causality.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7275152","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research","authors":[{"firstname":"Akosua

settings","abstract":"id='Par1'>Diagnostic testing for the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection remains a challenge around the world, especially in low-middle-income countries (LMICs) with poor socio-economic backgrounds.\n From the beginning of the pandemic in December 2019 to August 2021, a total of approximately 3.4 billion tests were performed globally.\n The majority of these tests were restricted to high income countries.\n Reagents for diagnostic testing became a premium, LMICs either cannot afford or find manufacturers unwilling to supply them with expensive analytical reagents and equipment.\n From March to December 2020 obtaining testing kits for SARS-CoV-2 testing was a challenge.\n As the number of SARS-CoV-2 infection cases increases globally, large-scale testing still remains a challenge in LMICs.\n The aim of this review paper is to compare the total number and frequencies of SARS-CoV-2 testing in LMICs and high-income countries (HICs) using publicly available data from Worldometer COVID-19, as well as discussing possible interventions and cost-effective measures to increase testing capability in LMICs.\n In summary, HICs conducted more SARS-CoV-2 testing (USA: 192%, Australia: 146%, Switzerland: 124% and Canada: 113%) compared to middle-income countries (MICs) (Vietnam: 43%, South Africa: 29%, Brazil: 27% and Venezuela: 12%) and low-income countries (LICs) (Bangladesh: 6%, Uganda: 4% and Nigeria: 1%).\n Some of the cost-effective solutions to counteract the aforementioned problems includes using saliva instead of oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal swabs, sample pooling, and testing high-priority groups to increase the number of mass testing in LMICs.\n","id":"PMC8783193","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

travel-associated primary case: a case series","abstract":"Background\nIn December, 2019, the newly identified severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China, causing COVID-19, a respiratory disease presenting with fever, cough, and often pneumonia.\n\n WHO has set the strategic objective to interrupt spread of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide.\n\n An outbreak in Bavaria, Germany, starting at the end of January, 2020, provided the opportunity to study transmission events, incubation period, and secondary attack rates.\n\n\nMethods\nA case was defined as a person with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by RT-PCR.\n\n Case interviews were done to describe timing of onset and nature of symptoms and to identify and classify contacts as high risk (had cumulative face-to-face contact with a confirmed case for ?15 min, direct contact with secretions or body fluids of a patient with confirmed COVID-19, or, in the case of health-care workers, had worked within 2 m of a patient with confirmed COVID-19 without personal protective equipment) or low risk (all other contacts).\n\n High-risk contacts were ordered to stay at home in quarantine for 14 days and were actively followed up and monitored for symptoms, and low-risk contacts were tested upon self-reporting of symptoms.\n\n We defined fever and cough as specific symptoms, and defined a prodromal phase as the presence of non-specific symptoms for at least 1 day before the onset of specific symptoms.\n\n Whole genome sequencing was used to confirm epidemiological links and clarify transmission events where contact histories were ambiguous; integration with epidemiological data enabled precise reconstruction of exposure events and incubation periods.\n\n Secondary attack rates were calculated as the number of cases divided by the number of contacts, using Fisher's exact test for the 95% CIs.\n\n\nFindings\nPatient 0 was a Chinese resident who visited Germany for professional reasons.\n\n 16 subsequent cases, often with mild and non-specific symptoms, emerged in four transmission generations.\n\n Signature mutations in the viral genome occurred upon foundation of generation 2, as well as in one case pertaining to generation 4. The median incubation period was 4·0 days (IQR 2·3–4·3) and the median serial interval was 4·0 days (3·0–5·0).\n\n Transmission events were likely to have occurred presymptomatically for one case (possibly five more), at the day of symptom onset for four cases (possibly five more), and the remainder after the day of symptom onset or unknown.\n\n One or two cases resulted from contact with a case during the prodromal phase.\n\n Secondary attack rates were 75·0% (95% CI 19·0–99·0; three of four people) among members of a household cluster in common isolation, 10·0% (1·2–32·0; two of 20) among household contacts only together until isolation of the patient, and 5·1% (2·6–8·9; 11 of 217) among non-household, high-risk contacts.\n\n\nInterpretation\nAlthough patients in our study presented with predominately mild, non-specific symptoms, infectiousness before or on the day of symptom onset was substantial.\n\n Additionally, the incubation period was often very short and false-negative tests occurred.\n\n These results suggest that although the outbreak was controlled, successful long-term and global containment of COVID-19 could be difficult to achieve.\n\n\nFunding\nAll authors are employed and all expenses covered by governmental, federal state, or other publicly funded institutions.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7228725","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Merle M","surname":"Böhmer","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Udo","surname":"Buchholz","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Victor M","surname":"Corman","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Martin","surname":"Hoch","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Katharina","surname":"Katz","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Durdica V","surname":"Marosevic","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Stefanie","surname":"Böhm","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tom","surname":"Woudenberg","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nikolaus","surname":"Ackermann","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Regina","surname":"Konrad","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ute","surname":"Eberle","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Bianca","surname":"Treis","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alexandra","surname":"Dangel","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Katja","surname":"Bengs","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Volker","surname":"Fingerle","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Anja","surname":"Berger","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Stefan","surname":"Hörmansdorfer","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Siegfried","surname":"Ippisch","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Bernd","surname":"Wicklein","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Andreas","surname":"Grahl","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kirsten","surname":"Pörtner","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nadine","surname":"Muller","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nadine","surname":"Zeitlmann","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"T Sonia","surname":"Boender","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Cai","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Andreas","surname":"Reich","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Maria","surname":"an der Heiden","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ute","surname":"Rexroth","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Osamah","surname":"Hamouda","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Julia","surname":"Schneider","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Talitha","surname":"Veith","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Barbara","surname":"Mühlemann","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Roman","surname":"Wölfel","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Markus","surname":"Antwerpen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mathias","surname":"Walter","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ulrike","surname":"Protzer","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Bernhard","surname":"Liebl","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Walter","surname":"Haas","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Andreas","surname":"Sing","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Christian","surname":"Drosten","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Andreas","surname":"Zapf","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1186/s13223-020-00509-y","date":"2020-12-21","title":"Asthma and COVID-19: a systematic review","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>Severe coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) presents with progressive dyspnea, which results from acute lung inflammatory edema leading to hypoxia.\n\n As with other infectious diseases that affect the respiratory tract, asthma has been cited as a potential risk factor for severe COVID-19.

In a few countries, the use of diagnostic testing on a massive scale has been a cornerstone of successful containment strategies.\n In contrast, the United States, hampered by limited testing capacity, has prioritized testing for specific groups of persons.\n Real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction–based assays performed in a laboratory on respiratory specimens are the reference standard for COVID-19 diagnostics.\n However, point-of-care technologies and serologic immunoassays are rapidly emerging.\n Although excellent tools exist for the diagnosis of symptomatic patients in well-equipped laboratories, important gaps remain in screening asymptomatic persons in the incubation phase, as well as in the accurate determination of\nlive viral shedding during convalescence to inform decisions to end isolation.\n Many affluent countries have encountered challenges in test delivery and specimen collection that have inhibited rapid increases in testing capacity.\n These challenges may be even greater in low-resource settings.\n Urgent clinical and public health needs currently drive an unprecedented global effort to increase testing capacity for

Covid-19","abstract":"Background\nNo therapeutics have yet been proven effective for the treatment of severe illness caused by SARS-CoV-2.\nMethods\nWe conducted a randomized, controlled, open-label trial involving hospitalized adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, which causes the respiratory illness Covid-19, and an oxygen saturation (Sao2) of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air or a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen (Pao2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) of less than 300 mm Hg.\n\n Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lopinavir–ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively) twice a day for 14 days, in addition to standard care, or standard care alone.\n\n The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement, defined as the time from randomization to either an improvement of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital, whichever came first.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 199 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent randomization; 99 were assigned to the lopinavir–ritonavir group, and 100 to the standard-care group.\n\n Treatment with lopinavir–ritonavir was not associated with a difference from standard care in the time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio for clinical improvement, 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to 1.72).\n\n Mortality at 28 days was similar in the lopinavir–ritonavir group and the standard-care group (19.2% vs.\n\n 25.0%; difference, ?5.8 percentage points; 95% CI, ?17.3 to 5.7).\n\n The percentages of patients with detectable viral RNA at various time points were similar.\n\n In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, lopinavir–ritonavir led to a median time to clinical improvement that was shorter by 1 day than that observed with standard care (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.91).\n\n Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common in the lopinavir–ritonavir group, but

Collection of nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS), the preferred sample type for SARS-CoV-2 detection, has become difficult due to the dramatic increase in testing and consequent supply strain.\nABSTRACT\nIdentifying SARS-CoV-2 infections through aggressive diagnostic testing remains critical to tracking and curbing the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Collection of nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS), the preferred sample type for SARS-CoV-2 detection, has become difficult due to the dramatic increase in testing and consequent supply strain. Therefore, alternative specimen types have been investigated that provide similar detection sensitivity with reduced health care exposure and the potential for self-collection. In this study, the detection sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 in nasal swabs (NS) and saliva was compared to that of NPS using matched specimens from two outpatient cohorts in New York State (total n = 463). The first cohort showed only a 5.4% positivity, but the second cohort (n = 227) had a positivity rate of 41%, with sensitivity in NPS, NS, and saliva of 97.9%, 87.1%, and 87.1%, respectively. Whether the reduced sensitivity of NS or saliva is acceptable must be assessed in the settings where they are used. However, we sought to improve on it by validating a method to mix the two sample types, as the combination of nasal swab and saliva resulted in 94.6% SARS-CoV-2 detection sensitivity. Spiking experiments showed that combining them did not adversely affect the detection sensitivity in either. Virus stability in saliva was also investigated, with and without the addition of commercially available stabilizing solutions. The virus was stable in saliva at both 4 C and room temperature for up to 7 days. The addition of stabilizing solutions did not enhance stability and, in some situations, reduced detectable virus levels.\nINTRODUCTION\nIdentifying acute COVID-19 infection through diagnostic testing and screening remains critical in our efforts to care for affected patients and curb the pandemic. Accordingly, laboratory services have worked to expand testing capacity, improve turnaround times, track the course of the outbreak, and provide data for patient management and the implementation of appropriate mitigation efforts and health care services.\nThe original standard for diagnosing COVID-19 was molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA on a nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) collected in virus transport medium (VTM). Unfortunately, performing NPS necessitates the use of a specifically designed swab and requires health care workers to wear extensive personal protective equipment (PPE). Within weeks of the pandemic onset in the United States, multiple aspects of the specimen collection and testing process became extremely difficult. The desired testing capacity quickly exceeded anything attempted in the country before, and vendors were unable to meet the supply demands for all required sampling components, including the specific swabs used for NPS specimen collection, VTM, PPE, reagents, and instruments needed for testing the samples at the laboratories. In response, a number of changes were implemented: guidelines were rapidly changed to require clinicians to limit the use of (or to reuse) PPE, alternatives to VTM were tested and implemented, and numerous additional commercial diagnostic tests and instruments were authorized and distributed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-legal-regulatory-and-policy-framework/emergency-use-authorization#covid19euas). Additionally, other sample types were assessed as alternatives to NPS.\nTesting of oropharyngeal swabs (OPS), nasal swabs (NS), midturbinate swabs (MTS), and saliva provided the opportunity to be less restrictive about the type of swab used, and the last three options also offer the additional advantage of self-collection. This has been demonstrated to be successful in previous studies on influenza detection, where self-collected specimens were found to have detection rates similar to those collected by health care personnel. Major advantages of self-collection include limiting the exposure of health care workers to potentially infected patients, subsequently reducing the use of PPE, and limiting the exposure of patients to hospitals, where infection is likely more prevalent. Self-collection also allows for individuals to conveniently test themselves at home, which could lead to increased testing rates with a limited burden on health care systems.\nTherefore, numerous recent studies have focused on the comparative sensitivity of upper respiratory swabs other than NPS, which has long been considered the preferred option for the optimal detection of most respiratory viruses. Experience with saliva as a diagnostic sample type for respiratory viruses has been limited, although in recent months, several studies have suggested saliva is of acceptable or equal sensitivity to NPS or other specimen types for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. Some studies have also proposed the use of saliva stabilizing solutions, and it has been unclear whether these are necessary or advantageous.\nIn this study, nasal swabs and saliva were compared to NPS for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in outpatients from two distinct New York populations, one of which had high prevalence while the other had low. The stability of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva and the utility of three stabilizing solutions were investigated. Finally, methods for combining swabs and saliva in the laboratory were assessed to maximize detection of the virus without running multiple tests when more than one specimen type is collected.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nSpecimen collection sites and patients.\nThis study was granted nonresearch determination under the emergency response criterion by the New York State Department of Health Institutional Review Board.\nTwo sites were accessed for specimens collected between 20 and 26 March 2020. The first testing site was a large tent erected on the Albany Medical Center (AMC) Emergency Department parking lot in Albany, NY. Open from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. for 2.5 days, this walk-in site enrolled 236 subjects. Patients without an appointment could be tested for COVID-19 and were not required to be symptomatic. No patients were excluded. The second testing site was a drive-through Regional Operations Center (ROC) in New Rochelle (NR), NY, where an identified superspreader event had taken place early in the pandemic and the COVID-19 positivity rate was known to be high. Patients were required to have an appointment and qualifying symptoms or exposures; 227 subjects were enrolled from this site.\nSpecimen types, collection, and transport.\nThree specimens were collected from each subject: nasopharyngeal swab (NPS), nasal swab (NS), and saliva. Collection of NS was by bilateral swabbing on flocked swabs with insertion to approximately one inch and gentle rotation for several seconds. For NPS swabs, appropriate flocked NPS swabs were inserted in the NP cavity and gently rotated for 10 to 15 s. Both NS and NPS were placed in separate tubes containing 1 ml molecular transport medium (MTM; Longhorn Vaccines and Diagnostics, LLC, San Antonio, TX). Saliva samples were collected in sterile 50-ml conical tubes. Patients were instructed to refrain from eating, drinking, chewing gum or tobacco, or smoking for 30 min prior to collection and to work up saliva in their mouth, not cough, and to drool or gently spit the saliva into the container. Specimens from AMC were brought to the Wadsworth Center Laboratory of Viral Diseases (LVD) approximately every 2 to 4 h for accessioning and testing. Those from NR were placed in coolers and transported to the LVD within 24 h for accessioning and testing. Specimens were held at 4 C from the time of collection to the time of processing into lysis buffer for molecular testing. All testing was performed within 24 to 72 h of the time of specimen collection.\nSARS-CoV-2 testing.\nNPS and NS specimens collected in MTM did not require further processing before extraction. Saliva volumes varied from 1 to 10 ml. Many samples from the NR cohort were excessively mucoid and could not be aspirated through a 1,000-mul pipette tip for transfer into lysis buffer. To streamline the process, all samples from the NR cohort were digested prior to extraction with 0.5 to 1 ml Snap n' Digest (Scientific Device Laboratory, Des Plaines, IL), vortexed, and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Samples from AMC with mucus or excessive viscosity were selectively digested as described above.\nThe CDC 2019 nCoV real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) diagnostic panel was used to test all samples. Total nucleic acid extraction was conducted on the bioMerieux easyMAG or EMAG (bioMerieux Inc, Durham, NC) or MagNA Pure 96 system (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). Briefly, for all specimens tested using the easyMAG or EMAG, 110 mul of sample was added to 2 ml NucliSENS lysis buffer (bioMerieux) and extracted into 110 mul of eluate. For specimens extracted using the MagNA Pure 96, 100 mul specimen was added to 350 mul lysis buffer and eluted into 100 mul.\nTesting was performed on ABI 7500FAST Dx instruments as described in the instructions for use (IFU) on the FDA website. All cycle threshold (CT) values for viral RNA detection presented here are for the N1 gene.\nVirus and viral RNA quantification.\nA SARS-CoV-2 isolate, USA-WA1/2020, was obtained from BEI Resources (NIH/ATCC, Manassas, VA) and amplified in Vero E6 cells, in accordance with biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) procedures. Viral isolate RNA was extracted and quantified by standard curve using RNA transcript synthesized to contain all SARS-CoV-2 N-gene targets in the CDC 2019-nCoV real-time RT-PCR diagnostic panel (Bio-Synthesis, Inc., Lewisville, TX).\nValidation of specimen types for viral detection.\nValidation of all specimen types with the CDC 2019-nCoV real-time RT-PCR diagnostic panel included a limit of detection determination, followed by a clinical evaluation panel. To perform these experiments in a BSL-2 environment, quantified SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA, rather than infectious virus, was spiked into lysed negative specimens prior to extraction. Saliva was validated for use on the easyMAG and EMAG instruments as well as on the MagNA Pure 96 system (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). Combined saliva and nasal swab specimens were validated on the easyMAG and EMAG instruments only.\nTo investigate the possibility of maximizing virus detection without doubling the number of tests performed, mixed saliva and nasal swabs were validated as a sample type in the following manner: 110 mul of each specimen was added to the same 2-ml lysis buffer tube, eluted into 110 mul, and tested as one sample. To mimic situations in which saliva is positive and nasal swabs are negative or vice versa, and to confirm that there is no adverse impact on detection, limits of detection (LOD) were determined for spiked combined specimens.\nLOD were assessed by first testing a range-finding dilution series, in triplicate, to estimate the LOD and then confirmed by spiking that concentration of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA into 20 individual clinical specimens. The LOD was determined as that which gave at least 95% detection of the sample replicates.\nTo evaluate the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical saliva samples, individual negative saliva specimens were spiked with quantified viral RNA at the following range of concentrations in triplicate: 2x, 4x, 6x, 8x, 10x, and 100x the established LOD. These evaluations were also performed with combined saliva and nasal swab specimens. Additionally, 19 previously positive nasal swabs in viral transport medium (VTM), with original CT values ranging from 20 to 39, and three positive saliva specimens, with CT values of 21 to 33, were individually reanalyzed and tested in combination with the other negative samples.\nSaliva stabilizing experiments.\nTo evaluate the stability of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva and to determine the necessity of stabilizing solutions for virus preservation in saliva, infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus was spiked into pooled negative saliva and sampled at multiple time points, with storage at multiple temperatures, with and without the addition of various stabilizing buffers. Individual saliva specimens were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time RT-PCR before using in stability studies to verify their negative status. Table 1 summarizes the multiple parameters assessed in the stabilizing experiments.\nExperimental parameters for stability studies\nMatrix	Virus concn spiked (gene copies, gc/ml)	Temp	Time point (day)	 	Saliva only	High, 1 x 106; low, 2 x 105	4 C, room temp, -80 C	0, 1, 3, 5, 7	 	VTM only	High, 1 x 106; low, 2 x 105	4 C, room temp, -80 C	0, 1, 3, 5, 7	 	Nasal Swab only	High, 1 x 106; low, 2 x 105	4 C, room temp, -80 C	0, 1, 3	 	Saliva + Nasal Swab only	High, 1 x 106; low, 2 x 105	4 C, room temp, -80 C	0	 	Saliva + VTM	High, 1 x 106; low, 2 x 105	4 C, room temp, -80 C	0, 1, 3, 5, 7	 	Saliva + 23andMe stabilization buffer	High, 1 x 106; low, 2 x 105	4 C, room temp, -80 C	0, 1, 3, 5, 7	 	Saliva + AncestryDNA stabilization buffer	High, 1 x 106; low, 2 x 105	4 C, room temp, -80 C	0, 1, 3, 5, 7	 	Saliva + AncestryDNA stabilization buffer, combined with nasal swab	High, 1 x 106; low, 2 x 105	4 C, room temp, -80 C	0, 1, 3	 	\nSARS-CoV-2 isolate USA-WA1/2020, cultured and harvested as described above, was used in all stabilizing experiments. Stock viral RNA concentration was calculated at 2.2 x 107 RNA gene copies/mul as described above. Stock virus was diluted in Eagles minimal essential medium (EMEM) plus 2% fetal bovine serum to working concentrations, and samples in each experiment were spiked with either high (1 x 106 RNA copies/ml specimen or 5,000 RNA copies/PCR) or low (2 x 105 RNA copies/ml specimen or 200 RNA copies/PCR) concentrations in duplicate.\nSampling of all specimens for the stability studies included lysis of 110 mul specimen into 2 ml NucliSENS lysis buffer, extraction on EMAG or easyMAG instruments into 110 mul of elution buffer, and analysis by the CDC real-time RT-PCR diagnostic panel. CT values were averaged and plotted using GraphPad Prism software, version 8.3.0.\n23andMe stabilization buffer.\nSaliva stabilization kits were kindly donated by 23andMe (Sunnyvale, CA). Stabilizing buffer was removed from the kits and pooled. A total of 32 tubes (15 ml polypropylene), each containing 1 ml saliva, were spiked with SARS-CoV-2 (16 high and 16 low virus concentrations), followed by the immediate addition of 1 ml stabilization buffer, and then mixed thoroughly. An additional 32 tubes were prepared containing 0.5 ml saliva spiked with high and low virus concentrations, followed by the immediate addition of 0.5 ml VTM, and then mixed thoroughly. All samples were then sampled and analyzed by real-time RT-PCR (day 0) by standard procedures, starting with a 110-mul transfer to lysis buffer tubes as described above. Duplicate tubes at each concentration were then stored at room temperature, 4 C, and -80 C, and samples were tested on each of days 1, 3, 5, and 7, except for those stored at -80 C, which were only analyzed on day seven.\nAncestryDNA stabilization buffer.\nAncestryDNA saliva collection kits were kindly donated by the company (Lehi, UT) and used for additional saliva stability studies. In these experiments, the stability of SARS-CoV-2 was tested in saliva, VTM, saliva with VTM, and saliva with AncestryDNA (AcD) stabilization buffer. Briefly, tubes containing SARS-CoV-2-negative saliva or VTM were spiked with high and low virus concentrations (six replicates each), followed by the addition of stabilization buffer, mixing, and sampling as described above for the 23andMe experiment for day 0 analysis. The following volumes were used: saliva alone (1.5 ml), VTM alone (1.5 ml), saliva with VTM (0.5 ml saliva plus 1 ml VTM), and saliva with AcD (1 ml saliva plus 0.5 ml AcD buffer, per the manufacturer's instructions). Duplicate tubes of each concentration were prepared for each storage temperature and stored at room temperature, 4 C, and -80 C for up to 7 days. Stored, spiked samples were tested at appointed days when a 110-mul aliquot from each tube was lysed, extracted, and tested by real-time PCR at days 1, 3, and 7, except for those stored at -80 C, which were only sampled at day seven.\nStabilization with saliva and nasal swab combination.\nAncestryDNA saliva collection kits were used for stability studies in an experiment to investigate the stability of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva, nasal swab in VTM, and saliva with AcD stabilization buffer. In addition, to observe the effects of combining specimens on SARS-CoV-2 detection sensitivity, saliva alone and in combination with nasal swabs in VTM were lysed and analyzed together. Pooled negative saliva and pooled nasal swabs in VTM, all negative for SARS-CoV-2, were used in this experiment. A total of 18 tubes were prepared, 12 containing 2 ml saliva (alone) and 6 containing 2 ml NS in VTM. Four saliva tubes were spiked with high virus and four with low virus concentrations, and four remained unspiked. Two of each of these four (2 high, 2 low, and 2 no virus) were then mixed with 1 ml AcD stabilization buffer. Six NS tubes were also spiked with high, low, or no virus. Tubes were incubated at room temperature, and sampling was performed at three time points: days 0, 1.5, and 3. At each time point, 110 mul from each of the tubes was removed, lysed, extracted, and analyzed. In addition, 110 mul of each prepared saliva sample, with and without stabilization buffer, was lysed together with 110 mul of each prepared nasal swab sample, so that high, low, and negative saliva samples would be mixed with high, low, and negative nasal swab samples. Combined samples were then extracted as one specimen and analyzed.\nStatistical analyses.\nFor all statistical calculations, each CT value used is the mean of the N1 and N2 CT values for that positive specimen. In cases where a specimen type was not collected for an individual, that patient was then excluded from calculations of that specimen type's sensitivity. For the purpose of calculating sensitivities, true positives were determined as any CT value of &lt;45 for any specimen type. Sensitivities and associated confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using the R package pROC. Confidence intervals of sensitivities were calculated using 2,000 stratified bootstrap replicates. Two-sample Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to compare mean ranks of CT values between males and females for each specimen type. Wilcoxon rank sum tests were performed, and the results plotted, using the R package ggpubr. Conditional density plots were created using the R package vcd with default settings. R, version 3.6.3, was used for all preceding analyses.\nRESULTS\nPatient demographics and regional positivity rates.\nSpecimens were collected from a total of 463 individuals at two collection sites in New York State during the early weeks of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Samples were initially collected from 236 individuals at AMC. However, following initial testing of NPS, only 12 of 236 patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, a positivity rate too low (5%) to enable statistically meaningful comparisons (Fig. 1A). Specimen collection was immediately transferred to a location with known high positivity. During March 2020, New Rochelle (NR), NY, was one of the Northeast's earliest pandemic &quot;hot spots,&quot; with a significantly higher positivity rate than the rest of the state. Specimens were collected from 227 patients in NR with demographics as shown in Table 2. Of the 227 patients tested at that site, 93 (41%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2, with 74 patients positive in all three sample types, 7 positive in both NS and NPS, 5 positive in both saliva and NPS, and 5 positive in NPS alone. Interestingly, 2 patients were positive in saliva alone but none in NS alone, while NPS detected 91 of 93 positive patients (Fig. 1B). The distribution of viral load across age groups in the NR cohort, as indicated by CT value, is displayed in Fig. 2 and provides a visual indication of differences seen across sample types and age groups.\nComparison of positivity in different specimen types from the two collection sites. (A) Albany Medical Center (n = 236). (B) New Rochelle (n = 227).\nDistribution of negative, low-positive, and high-positive patients by age. Conditional density plots display the distribution of negative, low-, and high-positive samples by age. High-positive samples (darkest gray) showed CT values of &lt;24, low positives (medium gray) had 24 &lt;= CT &lt; 45, and negatives (light gray) had CT values of 45. Results are shown for NPS (A), NS (B), or saliva (C).\nPatient demographics\nParameter	Albany Medical Center cohort	New Rochelle cohort	 	All patients (n = 236)	Positive patients (n = 12)	All patients (n = 227)	Positive patients (n = 93)	 	Male gender, %	47	25	60	60	 	Age, yr	 	 0-5	4	0	0	0	 	 6-18	13	0	2	1	 	 19-45	133	6	149	63	 	 46-65	68	6	59	21	 	 &gt;65	16	0	6	4	 	 Unknown	2	0	11	4	 	 Age range	3-105	27-61	14-77	14-71	 	\nComparison of specimen sensitivities for SARS-CoV-2 detection.\nWe sought to determine whether NS or saliva specimens could be used as a surrogate sample type in place of NPS for SARS-CoV-2 detection when using the CDC 2019 nCoV real-time RT-PCR diagnostic panel. Comparisons of grouped CT values using a Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn's multiple-comparison post hoc test revealed statistically significant differences between the three sample types: the mean CT values for both NPS- and NS-positive samples were significantly lower (P &lt; 0.0001) than that of positive saliva samples, and the mean CT values for NPS and NS were not significantly different from one another (Fig. 3). When sensitivities and corresponding 95% confidence intervals for all specimen types were calculated, NPS and the combination of NS and saliva provided the highest sensitivities (97.8% and 94.6%, respectively) with overlapping 95% confidence intervals (Table 3). Both NS and saliva had lower, and identical, sensitivities and 95% confidence intervals (87.1% and 79.57 to 93.55 for both) than NPS or the combination of NS and saliva. The confidence intervals for NS and saliva overlapped that for the NS and saliva combination specimen type but not NPS specimen type (Table 3).\nComparison of SARS-CoV-2 detection by sample type and CT value. Matched CT values for NPS, NS, and saliva from all positive individuals collected at the ROC (n = 93) were compared using a Kruskal-Wallis test (P &lt; 0.0001) with Dunn's multiple comparisons post hoc test, which were used to compare the mean ranks of CT values between sample types. Bars represent means and 95% CI, and a CT value of 45 was assigned to undetected specimens. Asterisks represent P values derived from Dunn's multiple-comparison test (ns, not significant; *, P &lt;= 0.05; **, P &lt;= 0.01; ***, P &lt;= 0.001; ****, P &lt;= 0.0001).\nSensitivity of detection for NPS, NS, saliva, and NS plus saliva\nSpecimen type	Sensitivity (95% CI)	 	NPS	97.85 (94.62-100)	 	NS	87.10 (79.57-93.55)	 	Saliva	87.10 (79.57-93.55)	 	NS and saliva	94.62 (89.25-98.92)	 	\nValidation of saliva and nasal swabs for clinical testing.\nSaliva and NS as individual specimen types and the combination of NS plus saliva were all validated for testing on the CDC 2019 nCoV real-time RT-PCR diagnostic panel after extraction on the EMAG and easyMAG. The LOD for saliva, NS, and NS plus saliva were all found to be 25 RNA copies/PCR or 5 RNA copies/mul using both extraction platforms. Additionally, clinical evaluation studies of all specimen types with amended negative samples showed 100% accuracy (data not shown).\nA total of 20 individual negative saliva specimens were separately lysed and spiked with viral RNA in an amount that was calculated to result in a concentration of 25 RNA copies/PCR. Next, 20 individual negative nasal swabs, in VTM, were added to the lysed saliva, and the combined sample was analyzed. For the reverse, 20 individual negative nasal swab specimens were separately lysed and spiked with 25 copies/PCR, and the same volume of 20 negative saliva samples was added to the lysed nasal swabs. These combined samples were then extracted and analyzed.\nA clinical evaluation was also performed on samples of mixed NS and saliva specimens from positive patients. A total of 15 previously positive NS samples were retrieved and retested with and without the addition of saliva. All were positive when combined, and CT values were not adversely affected (Fig. 4). Linear regression analysis indicated a high correlation between nasal swab only CT values and nasal swab with saliva CT values, even for samples with moderately weak values (CT values between 30 and 35).\nAddition of saliva does not interfere with CT values of nasal swabs. Nasal swab specimens, previously positive for SARS-CoV-2, were retrieved from -80 C storage and retested by real-time RT-PCR. Negative saliva was extracted together with the same nasal swab specimens. Linear regression analysis was performed on both comparisons.\nSARS-CoV-2 stability in saliva with stabilization solutions.\nA series of experiments were then performed in which virus-spiked saliva was supplemented with different stabilization buffers to examine the stability of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva and the utility of commercial stabilizing solutions. Samples were tested at high and low virus levels, held at different temperatures for various time periods (as described in Materials and Methods), and analyzed for changes in CT values that would indicate a loss of detectable viral RNA.\nAn initial experiment compared the deterioration of virus in spiked saliva, stabilized by the addition of VTM, to that of spiked saliva with the stabilization buffer from 23andMe. Samples were stored at 4 C and room temperature and tested at days 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7. The SARS-CoV-2 virus in saliva was more stable in VTM than in 23andMe stabilizing solution, as indicated by CT values over time at either temperature (Fig. 5). Greatest losses in detectable viral RNA were seen at day 7 in saliva with 23andMe stabilizing solution, particularly in samples that had been stored at room temperature, while those in VTM showed little to no change. A similar experiment comparing viral RNA detection in saliva supplemented with VTM or stabilization solution from Ancestry also showed no benefit from the addition of stabilization solution and again a significant loss of detectable virus at day 7 in samples that had stabilization solution added to them. Interestingly, in this experiment the virus in spiked saliva with no additives was just as stable as that in VTM, producing unchanged CT values after 7 days of storage at either 4 C or room temperature (Fig. 6). The virus was also just as stable in NS at either 4 C or room temperature as in saliva over a 3-day test period, while again losing detectable virus in saliva if stabilization buffer was added (Fig. 7).\nVirus stability in saliva samples mixed with 23andMe stabilization buffer or VTM. Mixtures of saliva plus 23andMe buffer (blue) or VTM (purple) and virus were held at room temperature (A, dashed lines) or 4 C (B, solid lines) and sampled at days 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7 in duplicate. Mean CT values for N1 were plotted, and simple linear regression analysis was performed. The slope of all VTM curves did not deviate significantly from zero; the slope of the 23andMe low spike at 4 C did not deviate significantly from zero, and the slope of all other 23andMe plots significantly deviated from zero (P &lt; 0.02).\nVirus stability in saliva alone, saliva with VTM, or saliva combined with AncestryDNA (AcD) stabilization buffer. Saliva alone (red), saliva plus VTM (purple), and saliva plus AcD buffer, all spiked with virus, were held at room temperature (A, dashed lines) or 4 C (B, solid lines) and sampled, in duplicate, at days 0, 1, 3, and 7. Mean CT values were plotted, and simple linear regression analysis was performed. Slopes for neither saliva alone nor saliva plus VTM deviated from zero; all slopes for saliva plus AcD buffer significantly deviated from zero (P &lt; 0.02).\nVirus stability over time. Viral RNA detection at both high (A) and low (B) spiked virus concentrations in saliva (red), saliva plus AcD buffer (blue), and NS in VTM (green). Samples were held at room temperature and collected, in duplicate, at 0, 36, and 72 h; mean CT values are plotted.\nIn a final series of experiments, we explored whether adding saliva and nasal swabs together and testing as a single specimen impacted the detection of the virus and whether stabilization solution being previously added to the saliva impacted detection when stored at room temperature for up to 3 days. Results are graphed in Fig. 8 and show that (i) the presence of a high virus level in saliva is not impacted by the addition of a high, low, or negatively spiked nasal swab, (ii) a low-level spiked saliva sample is not impacted by a low or negative spike nasal swab and the addition of a high-level spiked nasal swab raises the virus level to high (detecting the high level of virus in the nasal swab), and (iii) the presence of saliva does not impact the detection of low- or high-level virus spiked into nasal swabs. All these findings are consistent across the 3 days that the sampling was performed. Interestingly, when the same sample combination experiments are performed using saliva supplemented with stabilization buffer, the presence of the solution does not affect the detection of the virus in nasal swabs; however, it does affect its detection in saliva (Fig. 8D, E, and F). With the exception of the detection of some high-level spiked virus in saliva at time point 0 (Fig. 8D), the addition of stabilization buffer effectively eliminated the virus detection in saliva at all other time points and concentrations (Fig. 8D and E), leaving detectable virus only in the NS.\nEffect of mixed saliva and NS specimens with high and low virus concentrations, with and without the addition of stabilization buffer to the saliva. (A, B, and C) High, low, and negative saliva mixed with high, low, and negative NS. (D, E, and F) High, low, and negative saliva with stabilization buffer mixed with high, low, and negative NS.\nDISCUSSION\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic continues, ongoing supply issues with collection devices and PPE at a national and international level, together with increasing demands for laboratory testing, has necessitated the exploration of alternative options for specimen types to maintain effective mitigation strategies. It will be difficult to find a consensus for the relative performance of different sample types across studies performed on different patient groups for a disease with such variable severity and presentations, across a wide range of age groups, using an array of collection devices and transport media, and with the additional variables of time postonset and time postsample collection.\nCOVID-19 has primarily affected adults and older persons. This is reflected in the populations of both cohorts tested in this study, as neither included large numbers of pediatric patient samples. The number of samples from the geriatric population (&gt;65), however, was low in both cohorts and could be a result of the collections being performed at walk-through and drive-through clinics.\nIn the study reported here, the results show that in the outpatient group tested that was not severely ill, NPS specimens produced greatest sensitivity at approximately 98%, while NS or saliva alone provided sensitivities of approximately 87%. Whether the reduction in detection sensitivity that occurs with the use of these specimen types is acceptable has to be assessed in the settings in which they are being used, taking into account the more ready availability of NS swabs, the convenience of collection, the reduced discomfort of NS and saliva collection, and the potential for self-collection of these specimens and, thus, diminished risk of transmission to health care personnel. Notably, some other studies have not found sensitivity differences this great, while others have found them more extreme. By combining the NS and saliva specimens in the laboratory, we could increase sensitivity to 95%, an additional 8% above NS or saliva alone; we believe this to be a substantial improvement and a beneficial option for sensitive diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2.\nOf note, we did find that many of the submitted saliva specimens from NR were excessively mucoid, clearly containing material that had been coughed into the specimen and had to be digested, similar to the process used for sputum. Following this experience, we issued strict instructions not to cough or do anything that would result in excess mucus in the sample but to dribble or gently spit into the collection tube. In some other publications, the term &quot;saliva&quot; has been used loosely, and, on reading the specimen description carefully, has clearly included the deliberate collection of mucus. It is unclear from descriptions in most of the published papers where saliva has been studied, however, if they were truly saliva specimens or if they were a combination of saliva and sputum and what the relative sensitivity of the two specimen types is for detecting SARS-CoV-2. Saliva does present an attractive alternative to both NPS and NS specimens, because the only collection consumable needed is a tube. Notably, this sampling strategy has limitations: it may not be suitable for children, mentally challenged patients, or severely ill patients. The collection of saliva is clearly not suitable for intubated patients, and the use of alternative sample types should be continued for those situations.\nSaliva contains many antibodies and enzymes that could ultimately affect the stability of virus particles or viral RNA, which could impede detection. In our sample comparison from the NR cohort, significantly higher CT values were observed in saliva samples than in NS or NPS. As a result, concerns were raised regarding viral stability in this sample type, and a series of experiments were undertaken to assess this and the possibility of improving stability with solutions from commercial saliva collection kits. Previous reports have shown viral RNA stability in saliva for 24 h at both room temperature and 4 C. In this study, however, we found surprising viral RNA stability in saliva alone for up to 7 days, even at room temperature, whereas the addition of stabilization solutions had adverse effects. It must be noted that these solutions are intended for stabilizing DNA, not RNA, and subsequent versions from commercial manufacturers specifically for RNA stabilization may have different results. However, at the time the work was done, neither company had equivalent saliva collection kits available with RNA stabilizing solutions, and it was their decision to have us proceed with the testing using the available stabilizers. It must also be noted that virus stability was only measured with regard to molecular detection. For investigators interested in studies on culturable infectious particles, the stability of virus infectivity may be different.\nIn symptomatic COVID-19 patients, SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA can be detected 1 to 2 days before symptom onset and several days postonset. Thereafter, viral loads decrease substantially; however, there are numerous reports of patients remaining RNA positive for prolonged periods of time and some individuals having intermittent bouts of repeated positivity. Whether these are reinfections, reactivations, or simply low levels of residual virus at the limits of detection of the assay is unclear. Moreover, we have much to learn about the behavior of viral loads in the large numbers of asymptomatic cases now being detected during mass screening of personnel and preprocedure patients. A few studies have recently become available on the relative sensitivities of various specimen types for SARS-CoV-2 detection in asymptomatic individuals and suggest that saliva can be considered an acceptable alternative sample type in these populations. The findings of our study, i.e., the combination of NS and saliva provides similar sensitivity to NPS while alleviating many of its limitations, should be carefully considered based on the setting and the study population being tested. Processes at laboratories must always be individually assessed for suitability at the site, with allowance for numerous aspects of pre- and postanalytical processes as well as the testing platforms and chemistries being utilized.

sensitivity.\n Healthy infants were included at signs of first respiratory tract infection.\n Paired nasopharyngeal aspirates and nasal swabs were collected.\n Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out for 11 respiratory pathogens.\n Paired nasopharyngeal aspirates and nasal swabs were collected in 98 infants.\n Rhinovirus (n?=?67) and respiratory syncytial virus (n?=?39) were the most frequently detected.\n Co-infection occurred in 48% (n?=?45) of the infants.\n The sensitivity of the nasal swab was lower than the nasopharyngeal aspirate, in particular, for respiratory syncytial virus (51% vs.\n 100%) and rhinovirus (75% vs.\n 97%).\n The sensitivity of the nasal swab was strongly determined by the cycle threshold (CT) value (p?&lt;?0.001).\n The sensitivity of the swab for respiratory syncytial virus, but not rhinovirus, was 100% in children with severe symptoms (score ?11).\n It is concluded that, for community-based studies and surveillance purposes, the

knowledge","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>Coronaviruses (CoVs) primarily cause enzootic infections in birds and mammals but, in the last few decades, have shown to be capable of infecting humans as well.\n\n The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and, more recently, Middle-East respiratory syndrome (MERS) has demonstrated the lethality of CoVs when they cross the species barrier and infect humans.\n\n A renewed interest in coronaviral research has led to the discovery of several novel human CoVs and since then much progress has been made in understanding the CoV life cycle.\n\n The CoV envelope (E) protein is a small, integral membrane protein involved in several aspects of the virus’ life cycle, such as assembly, budding, envelope formation, and pathogenesis.\n\n Recent studies have expanded on its structural motifs and topology, its functions as an ion-channelling viroporin, and its interactions with both other CoV proteins and host cell proteins.\n\n\nMain body\nid='Par2'>This review aims to establish the current knowledge on CoV E by highlighting the recent progress that has been made and comparing it to previous knowledge.\n\n It

rapid spread over many healthcare systems throughout the world has led to a shortage in personal protective equipment (PPE), which cannot be solved by reducing their use or by increasing production.\n\n It is thus necessary to promote PPE rational use, highlighting possible differences in terms of efficacy and promoting an effective technique to reuse them.\n\n\nMethods\nA literature search was performed on PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane database, and Google Scholar, and from the 25 top cited articles, 15 were selected for relevance and impact.\n\n\nResults\nMost studies on previous respiratory virus epidemics to date suggest surgical masks are not inferior compared with N95 respirators in terms of protective efficacy among healthcare workers.\n\n Therefore, the use of N95 respirators should be limited to high-risk situations.\n\n Concerning respirator reuse, highly energetic, short-wave, ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) at 254 nm was determined to decontaminate N95 respirators from viral respiratory agents, but UVGI requires careful consideration of the type of respirator and of the biologic target.\n\n\nConclusions\nRational use and successful reuse of respirators can help in the shortage of PPE during a pandemic.\n\n Further studies testing UVGI and other decontamination techniques are an unmet need.\n\n The definitive answer to pandemic issues can be found in artificial intelligence and deep learning.\n\n These groundbreaking modalities could help in identifying high-risk patients and in suggesting appropriate types and use of

sweeps across the world, the availability of viral transport medium (VTM) has become severely limited, contributing to delays in diagnosis and rationing of diagnostic testing.\n Given that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral RNA has demonstrated stability, we posited that phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) may be a viable transport medium, as an alternative to VTM, for clinical real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) testing.\n The intra-individual reliability and interindividual reliability of SARS-CoV-2 qPCR were assessed in clinical endotracheal secretion samples transported in VTM or PBS to evaluate the stability of the qPCR signal for three viral targets (N gene, ORF1ab, and S gene) when samples were stored in these media at room temperature for up to 18 hours.\n We report that the use of PBS as a transport medium allows high intra-individual and interindividual reliability, maintains viral stability, and compares with VTM in the detection of the three SARS-CoV-2 genes through 18 hours of storage.\n This study establishes PBS as a clinically useful medium that can be readily deployed for transporting and short-term preservation of specimens containing SARS-CoV-2. Use of PBS as a transport medium has the potential to increase testing capacity for SARS-CoV-2, aiding more widespread screening and early diagnosis of COVID-19.","id":"PMC7219422","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"American Society for Investigative

associated with human to human transmission and severe human infection has been recently reported from the city of Wuhan in China.\n\n Our objectives were to characterize the genetic relationships of the 2019-nCoV and to search for putative recombination within the subgenus of sarbecovirus.\n\n\nMethods\nPutative recombination was investigated by RDP4 and Simplot v3.5.1 and discordant phylogenetic clustering in individual genomic fragments was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods.\n\n\nResults\nOur analysis suggests that the 2019-nCoV although closely related to BatCoV RaTG13 sequence throughout the genome (sequence similarity 96.3%), shows discordant clustering with the Bat_SARS-like coronavirus sequences.\n\n Specifically, in the 5?-part spanning the first 11,498 nucleotides and the last 3?-part spanning 24,341–30,696 positions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 formed a single cluster with Bat_SARS-like coronavirus sequences, whereas in the middle region spanning the 3?-end of ORF1a, the ORF1b and almost half of the spike regions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 grouped in a separate distant lineage within the sarbecovirus branch.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe levels of genetic similarity between the 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 suggest that the latter does not provide the exact variant that caused the outbreak in humans, but the hypothesis that 2019-nCoV has originated from bats is very likely.\n\n We show evidence that the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) is not-mosaic consisting in almost half of its genome of a distinct lineage within the betacoronavirus.\n\n These

increasingly occupied by COVID-19 patients, and hospitals are struggling to keep their normal operations.\n\n We review some basic epidemiological data of this new disease, regarding its appearance, reproductive rate, ways of transmission, number of cases, death rate, usefulness of diagnostic tests, basic treatment options, and prevention and control strategies, including vaccines.\n\n\nRecent Findings\nid='Par2'>The basic control strategy falls into two well established categories: active attack (control) or organized defense (mitigation).\n\n The control strategy relies on classic testing, tracing, and tracking possible cases of COVID-19. Those actions draw from classical epidemiology: to actively find and detect cases, isolate if positive for 10 days and treat when needed.\n\n At the same time, the search for close contacts, test them when needed and quarantine and monitor for 10 to 14 days in order to break chains of transmission.\n\n The mitigation strategy include basic measures to protect people at increased risk of severe illness, like social distancing, wearing a mask when social distancing is not possible, avoiding crowds, avoiding indoor crowded spaces, increase ventilation indoors and washing or sanitizing hands often.\n\n They include also targeted restrictions in people’s mobility, and lock-downs, widely used during the first wave in order to spare the health system, become overwhelmed and increasingly used

characterisation and epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and

Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data.\n\n Outcomes were followed up until Jan 25, 2020.\nFindings\nOf the 99 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, 49 (49%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market.\n\n The average age of the patients was 55·5 years (SD 13·1), including 67 men and 32 women.\n\n 2019-nCoV was detected in all patients by real-time RT-PCR.\n\n 50 (51%) patients had chronic diseases.\n\n Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (82 [83%] patients), cough (81 [82%] patients), shortness of breath (31 [31%] patients), muscle ache (11 [11%] patients), confusion (nine [9%] patients), headache (eight [8%] patients), sore throat (five [5%] patients), rhinorrhoea (four [4%] patients), chest pain (two [2%] patients), diarrhoea (two [2%] patients), and nausea and vomiting (one [1%] patient).\n\n According to imaging examination, 74 (75%) patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 14 (14%) patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity, and one (1%) patient had pneumothorax.\n\n 17 (17%) patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and, among them, 11 (11%) patients worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection was of clustering onset, is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n In general, characteristics of patients who died were in line with the MuLBSTA score, an early warning model for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia.\n\n Further investigation is needed to explore the applicability of the MuLBSTA score in

Our whole-genome analysis revealed that SARS-CoV-2 was the descendant of Bat SARS/SARS-like CoVs and bats served as a natural reservoir.\n SARS-CoV-2 used mutations and recombination as crucial strategies in different genomic regions including the envelop, membrane, nucleocapsid, and spike glycoproteins to become a novel infectious agent.\n We confirmed that mutations in different genomic regions of SARS-CoV-2 have specific influence on virus reproductive adaptability, allowing for genotype adjustment and adaptations in rapidly changing environments.\n Moreover, for the first time we identified nine putative recombination patterns in SARS-CoV-2, which encompass spike glycoprotein, RdRp, helicase and ORF3a.\n Six recombination regions were spotted in the S gene and are undoubtedly important for evolutionary survival, meanwhile this permitted the virus to modify superficial antigenicity to find a way from immune reconnaissance in animals and adapt to a human host.\n With these combined natural selected strategies, SARS-CoV-2 emerged as a novel virus in human society.\n","id":"PMC7157669","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"Saif ur","surname":"Rehman","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Laiba","surname":"Shafique","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Awais","surname":"Ihsan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qingyou","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak: a new challenge","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Update: novel influenza A (H1N1) virus infections - worldwide,Mmay 6, 2009","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"World Health OrganizationNovel Coronavirus (COVID-2019) situation reports. https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/685d0ace521648f8a5beeeee1b9125cd","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Italian Health MinistryCOVID-19 situation reports. http://www.salute.gov.it/portale/news/p3_2_1_1_1.jsp?lingua=italiano&amp;menu=notizie&amp;p=dalministero&amp;id=4399","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30627-9","date":"1970-01-01","title":"COVID-19 and Italy: what next?","abstract":"The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has already taken on pandemic proportions, affecting over 100 countries in a matter of weeks.\n A global response to prepare health systems worldwide is imperative.\n Although containment measures in China have reduced new cases by more than 90%, this reduction is not the case elsewhere, and Italy has been particularly affected.\n There is now grave concern regarding the Italian national health system's capacity to effectively respond to the needs of patients who are infected and require intensive care for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n The percentage of patients in intensive care reported daily in Italy between March 1 and March 11, 2020, has consistently been between 9% and 11% of patients who are actively infected.\n The number of patients infected since Feb 21 in Italy closely follows an exponential trend.\n If this trend continues for 1 more week, there will be 30?000 infected patients.\n Intensive care units will then be at maximum capacity; up to 4000 hospital beds will be needed by mid-April, 2020.

profiles of viral load in posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples and serum antibody responses during infection by SARS-CoV-2: an observational cohort study","abstract":"Background\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes severe community and nosocomial outbreaks.\n\n Comprehensive data for serial respiratory viral load and serum antibody responses from patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are not yet available.\n\n Nasopharyngeal and throat swabs are usually obtained for serial viral load monitoring of respiratory infections but gathering these specimens can cause discomfort for patients and put health-care workers at risk.\n\n We aimed to ascertain the serial respiratory viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in posterior oropharyngeal (deep throat) saliva samples from patients with COVID-19, and serum antibody responses.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did a cohort study at two hospitals in Hong Kong.\n\n We included patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. We obtained samples of blood, urine, posterior oropharyngeal saliva, and rectal swabs.\n\n Serial viral load was ascertained by reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR).\n\n Antibody levels against the SARS-CoV-2 internal nucleoprotein (NP) and surface spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) were measured using EIA.\n\n Whole-genome sequencing was done to identify possible mutations arising during infection.\n\n\nFindings\nBetween Jan 22, 2020, and Feb 12, 2020, 30 patients were screened for inclusion, of whom 23 were included (median age 62 years [range 37–75]).\n\n The median viral load in posterior oropharyngeal saliva or other respiratory specimens at presentation was 5·2 log10 copies per mL (IQR 4·1–7·0).\n\n Salivary viral load was highest during the first week after symptom onset and subsequently declined with time (slope ?0·15, 95% CI ?0·19 to ?0·11; R2=0·71).\n\n In one patient, viral RNA was detected 25 days after symptom onset.\n\n Older age was correlated with higher viral load (Spearman's ?=0·48, 95% CI 0·074–0·75; p=0·020).\n\n For 16 patients with serum samples available 14 days or longer after symptom onset, rates of seropositivity were 94% for anti-NP IgG (n=15), 88% for anti-NP IgM (n=14), 100% for anti-RBD IgG (n=16), and 94% for anti-RBD IgM (n=15).\n\n Anti-SARS-CoV-2-NP or anti-SARS-CoV-2-RBD IgG levels correlated with virus neutralisation titre (R2&gt;0·9).\n\n No genome mutations were detected on serial samples.\n\n\nInterpretation\nPosterior oropharyngeal saliva samples are a non-invasive specimen more acceptable to patients and health-care workers.\n\n Unlike severe acute respiratory syndrome, patients with COVID-19 had the highest viral load near presentation, which could account for the fast-spreading nature of this epidemic.\n\n This finding emphasises the importance of stringent infection control and early use of potent antiviral agents, alone or in combination, for high-risk individuals.\n\n Serological assay can complement RT-qPCR for diagnosis.\n\n\nFunding\nRichard and Carol Yu, May Tam Mak Mei Yin, The Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Tong, Marina Lee, Government Consultancy

SARS-CoV-2 Infections and Transmission in a Skilled Nursing Facility","abstract":"Background\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can spread rapidly within skilled nursing facilities.\n\n After identification of a case of Covid-19 in a skilled nursing facility, we assessed transmission and evaluated the adequacy of symptom-based screening to identify infections in residents.\n\n\nMethods\nWe conducted two serial point-prevalence surveys, 1 week apart, in which assenting residents of the facility underwent nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal testing for SARS-CoV-2, including real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), viral culture, and sequencing.\n\n Symptoms that had been present during the preceding 14 days were recorded.\n\n Asymptomatic residents who tested positive were reassessed 7 days later.\n\n Residents with SARS-CoV-2 infection were categorized as symptomatic with typical symptoms (fever, cough, or shortness of breath), symptomatic with only atypical symptoms, presymptomatic, or asymptomatic.\n\n\nResults\nTwenty-three days after the first positive test result in a resident at this skilled nursing facility, 57 of 89 residents (64%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Among 76 residents who participated in point-prevalence surveys, 48 (63%) tested positive.\n\n Of these 48 residents, 27 (56%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing; 24 subsequently developed symptoms (median time to onset, 4 days).\n\n Samples from these 24 presymptomatic residents had a median rRT-PCR cycle threshold value of 23.1, and viable virus was recovered from 17 residents.\n\n As of April 3, of the 57 residents with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 11 had been hospitalized (3 in the intensive care unit) and 15 had died (mortality, 26%).\n\n Of the 34 residents whose specimens were sequenced, 27 (79%) had sequences that fit into two clusters with a difference of one nucleotide.\n\n\nConclusions\nRapid and widespread transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was demonstrated in this skilled nursing facility.\n\n More than half of residents with positive test results were asymptomatic at the time of testing and most likely contributed to transmission.\n\n Infection-control strategies focused solely on symptomatic residents were not sufficient to prevent transmission after SARS-CoV-2 introduction into this facility.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7200056","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical Society","authors":[{"firstname":"Melissa

features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China,

radiological, and virological changes in a community outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).\n\n\nMethods\nWe followed up 75 patients for 3 weeks managed with a standard treatment protocol of ribavirin and corticosteroids, and assessed the pattern of clinical disease, viral load, risk factors for poor clinical outcome, and the usefulness of virological diagnostic methods.\n\n\nFindings\nFever and pneumonia initially improved but 64 (85%) patients developed recurrent fever after a mean of 8.9 (SD 3.1) days, 55 (73%) had watery diarrhoea after 7.5 (2.3) days, 60 (80%) had radiological worsening after 7.4 (2.2) days, and respiratory symptoms worsened in 34 (45%) after 8.6 (3.0) days.\n\n In 34 (45%) patients, improvement of initial pulmonary lesions was associated with appearance of new radiological lesions at other sites.\n\n Nine (12%) patients developed spontaneous pneumomediastinum and 15 (20%) developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in week 3. Quantitative reverse-transcriptase (RT) PCR of nasopharyngeal aspirates in 14 patients (four with ARDS) showed peak viral load at day 10, and at day 15 a load lower than at admission.\n\n Age and chronic hepatitis B virus infection treated with lamivudine were independent significant risk factors for progression to ARDS (p=0.001).\n\n SARS-associated coronavirus in faeces was seen on RT-PCR in 65 (97%) of 67 patients at day 14. The mean time to seroconversion was 20 days.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe consistent clinical progression, shifting radiological infiltrates, and an inverted V viral-load profile suggest that worsening in week 2 is unrelated to uncontrolled viral replication but may be related to immunopathological damage.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7112410","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"JSM","surname":"Peiris","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"CM","surname":"Chu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"VCC","surname":"Cheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"KS","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"IFN","surname":"Hung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"LLM","surname":"Poon","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"KI","surname":"Law","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"BSF","surname":"Tang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"TYW","surname":"Hon","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"CS","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"KH","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"JSC","surname":"Ng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"BJ","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"WL","surname":"Ng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"RWM","surname":"Lai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Y","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"KY","surname":"Yuen","email":"kyyuen@hkucc.hku.hk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1373/clinchem.2003.024125","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Quantitative Analysis and Prognostic Implication of SARS Coronavirus RNA in the Plasma and Serum of Patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","abstract":"\nBackground: The availability of an early diagnostic tool for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) would have major public health implications.\n We investigated whether the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) can be detected in serum and plasma samples during the early stages of SARS and studied the potential prognostic implications of such an approach.\n","id":"PMC7108161","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Oxford University Press","authors":[{"firstname":"Enders K O","surname":"Ng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"David S","surname":"Hui","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"K C Allen","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Emily C W","surname":"Hung","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rossa W K","surname":"Chiu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nelson","surname":"Lee","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Alan","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Stephen S C","surname":"Chim","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yu K","surname":"Tong","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Joseph J Y","surname":"Sung","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"John S","surname":"Tam","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Y M Dennis","surname":"Lo","email":"loym@cuhk.edu.hk","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.ijid.2020.03.062","date":"2020-03-25","title":"A first case of meningitis/encephalitis associated with SARS-Coronavirus-2","abstract":"\n\n\n•\nNovel coronavirus (SARS-Coronavirus-2:SARS-CoV-2) which emerged in Wuhan, China, has spread to multiple countries rapidly.\n","id":"PMC7195378","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"The Author(s).

to Validate the Sufficiency of Provider-Observed, Home-Collected Blood, Saliva, and Oropharyngeal Samples","abstract":"Background\nThe response in the United States to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has been hampered by a lack of aggressive testing for the infection.\n\n Testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cornerstone of an effective public health response.\n\n However, efforts to test have been hampered by limited reagents, limitations in the availability of swabs used for the collection of nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens, limitations in personal protective equipment (PPE) for health care providers collecting the NPS specimens, and limitations in viral transport media for transporting the specimens.\n\n Therefore, more flexible options for screening for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and serologic responses are critical to inform clinical and public health responses.\n\n\nObjective\nWe aim to document the ability of patients to self-collect sufficient specimens for SARS-CoV-2 viral detection and serology.\n\n\nMethods\nPatient self-collection of samples will be done with observation by a health care provider during a telemedicine session.\n\n Participants will be mailed a specimen collection kit, engage in a telehealth session with a provider through a HIPPA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996)-compliant video meeting, and collect specimens while being observed by the provider.\n\n Providers will record whether they are confident in the suitability of the specimen for laboratory testing that would inform clinical decision making.\n\n We will objectively assess the sufficiency of biological material in the mailed-in specimens.\n\n\nResults\nThe protocol was approved by the Emory University Institutional Review Board (IRB) on March 30, 2020 (Protocol number 371).\n\n To date, we have enrolled 159 participants.\n\n\nConclusions\nDefining a conceptual framework for assessing the sufficiency of patient-collected samples for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and serologic responses to infection is critical for facilitating public health responses and providing PPE-sparing options to increase testing.\n\n Validation of alternative methods of specimen collection should include objective measures of the sufficiency of specimens for testing.\n\n A strong evidence base for diversifying testing modalities will improve tools to guide public health responses to the COVID-19

quantitative reverse transcription real time PCR assay (RT-qPCR), viral load can be measured and monitored in a few hours.\n In this context, the development, standardization and validation of a RT-qPCR test to quickly and efficiently quantify yellow fever virus (YFV) in all stages of vaccine production are extremely important.\n To serve this purpose we used a plasmid construction containing the NS5 region from 17DD YFV to generate the standard curve and to evaluate parameters such as linearity, precision and specificity against other flavivirus.\n Furthermore, we defined the limits of detection as 25 copies/reaction, and quantification as 100 copies/reaction for the test.\n To ensure the quality of the method, reference controls were established in order to avoid false negative results.\n The qRT-PCR technique based on the use of TaqMan probes herein standardized proved to be effective for determining yellow fever viral load both in vivo and in vitro, thus becoming a very important tool to assure the quality control for vaccine production and evaluation of viremia after vaccination or YF disease.\n","id":"PMC4514303","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Taylor &amp; Francis","authors":[{"firstname":"Alice

patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe analysed case notes and microbiological findings for 50 patients with SARS, representing more than five separate epidemiologically linked transmission clusters.\n\n We defined the clinical presentation and risk factors associated with severe disease and investigated the causal agents by chest radiography and laboratory testing of nasopharyngeal aspirates and sera samples.\n\n We compared the laboratory findings with those submitted for microbiological investigation of other diseases from patients whose identity was masked.\n\n\nFindings\nPatients' age ranged from 23 to 74 years.\n\n Fever, chills, myalgia, and cough were the most frequent complaints.\n\n When compared with chest radiographic changes, respiratory symptoms and auscultatory findings were disproportionally mild.\n\n Patients who were household contacts of other infected people and had older age, lymphopenia, and liver dysfunction were associated with severe disease.\n\n A virus belonging to the family Coronaviridae was isolated from two patients.\n\n By use of serological and reverse-transcriptase PCR specific for this virus, 45 of 50 patients with SARS, but no controls, had evidence of infection with this virus.\n\n\nInterpretation\nA coronavirus was isolated from patients with SARS that might be the primary agent associated with this disease.\n\n Serological and

discovered coronavirus, SARS-associated coronavirus (SARSCoV).\n\n We did clinical and experimental studies to assess the role of this virus in the cause of SARS.\n\n\nMethods\nWe tested clinical and postmortem samples from 436 SARS patients in six countries for infection with SARSCoV, human metapneumovirus, and other respiratory pathogens.\n\n We infected four cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) with SARS-CoV in an attempt to replicate SARS and did necropsies on day 6 after infection.\n\n\nFindings\nSARS-CoV infection was diagnosed in 329 (75%) of 436 patients fitting the case definition of SARS; human metapneumovirus was diagnosed in 41 (12%) of 335, and other respiratory pathogens were diagnosed only sporadically.\n\n SARS-CoV was, therefore, the most likely causal agent of SARS.\n\n The four SARS-CoV-infected macaques excreted SARS-CoV from nose, mouth, and pharynx from 2 days after infection.\n\n Three of four macaques developed diffuse alveolar damage, similar to that in SARS patients, and characterised by epithelial necrosis, serosanguineous exudate, formation of hyaline membranes, type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia, and the presence of syncytia.\n\n SARS-CoV was detected in pneumonic areas by virus isolation and RT-PCR, and was localised to alveolar epithelial cells and syncytia by immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy.\n\n\nInterpretation\nReplication in SARS-CoV-infected macaques of pneumonia similar to that in human beings with SARS, combined with the high prevalence of SARS-CoV infection in SARS patients, fulfill the criteria required to prove that SARS-CoV is the primary cause of SARS.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7112434","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

were studied by histology and virology.\n\n Only one full autopsy was done.\n\n Evidence of infection with the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and human metapneumovirus was sought by reverse-transcriptase PCR and serology.\n\n Pathological samples were examined by light and electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry.\n\n\nFindings\nAll six patients had serological evidence of recent infection with SARS-CoV.\n\n Diffuse alveolar damage was common but not universal.\n\n Morphological changes identified were bronchial epithelial denudation, loss of cilia, and squamous metaplasia.\n\n Secondary bacterial pneumonia was present in one case.\n\n A giant-cell infiltrate was seen in four patients, with a pronounced increase in macrophages in the alveoli and the interstitium of the lung.\n\n Haemophagocytosis was present in two patients.\n\n The alveolar pneumocytes also showed cytomegaly with granular amphophilic cytoplasm.\n\n The patient for whom full

Influenza-Like Illness Among an Internet-Based Cohort in the UK During the 2014-2015 Flu Season: Pilot Study","abstract":"Background\nRoutine influenza surveillance, based on laboratory confirmation of viral infection, often fails to estimate the true burden of influenza-like illness (ILI) in the community because those with ILI often manage their own symptoms without visiting a health professional.\n\n Internet-based surveillance can complement this traditional surveillance by measuring symptoms and health behavior of a population with minimal time delay.\n\n Flusurvey, the UK’s largest crowd-sourced platform for surveillance of influenza, collects routine data on more than 6000 voluntary participants and offers real-time estimates of ILI circulation.\n\n However, one criticism of this method of surveillance is that it is only able to assess ILI, rather than virologically confirmed influenza.\n\n\nObjective\nWe designed a pilot study to see if it was feasible to ask individuals from the Flusurvey platform to perform a self-swabbing task and to assess whether they were able to collect samples with a suitable viral content to detect an influenza virus in the laboratory.\n\n\nMethods\nVirological swabbing kits were sent to pilot study participants, who then monitored their ILI symptoms over the influenza season (2014-2015) through the Flusurvey platform.\n\n If they reported ILI, they were asked to undertake self-swabbing and return the swabs to a Public Health England laboratory for multiplex respiratory virus polymerase chain reaction testing.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 700 swab kits were distributed at the start of the study; from these, 66 participants met the definition for ILI and were asked to return samples.\n\n In all, 51 samples were received in the laboratory, 18 of which tested positive for a viral cause of ILI (35%).\n\n\nConclusions\nThis demonstrated proof of concept that it is possible to apply self-swabbing for virological laboratory testing to an online cohort study.\n\n This pilot does not have significant numbers to validate whether Flusurvey surveillance accurately reflects influenza infection in the community, but highlights that the methodology is feasible.\n\n Self-swabbing could be expanded to larger online surveillance activities, such as during the initial stages of a pandemic, to understand community transmission or to better assess interseasonal activity.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5856931","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"JMIR

objective of this study was to estimate the disease burden associated with influenza-like illness (ILI) in the United Kingdom stratified by age, risk and influenza vaccination status.\n\n\nMethods\nThis retrospective, cross-sectional, exploratory, observational study used linked data from the General Practice Research Database and the Hospital Episode Statistics databases to estimate resource use and cost associated with ILI in the UK.\n\n\nResults\nData were included from 156,193 patients with ?1 general practitioner visit with ILI.\n\n There were 21,518 high-risk patients, of whom 12,514 (58.2%) were vaccinated and 9,004 (41.8%) were not vaccinated, and 134,675 low-risk patients, of whom 17,482 (13.0%) were vaccinated and 117,193 (87.0%) were not vaccinated.\n\n High-risk vaccinated patients were older (p&lt;0.001) and had more risk conditions (p&lt;0.001).\n\n High-risk (odds ratio [OR] 2.16) or vaccinated (OR 1.19) patients had a higher probability of &gt;1 general practitioner visit compared with low-risk and unvaccinated patients.\n\n Patients who were high-risk and vaccinated had a reduced risk of &gt;1 general practitioner visit (OR 0.82; p&lt;0.001).\n\n High-risk individuals who were also vaccinated had a lower probability of ILI-related hospitalisation than individuals who were high-risk or vaccinated alone (OR 0.59).\n\n In people aged ?65 years, the mortality rate was lower in vaccinated than unvaccinated individuals (OR 0.75).\n\n The cost of ILI-related GP visits and hospital admissions in the UK over the study period in low-risk vaccinated patients was £27,391,142 and £141,932,471, respectively.\n\n In low-risk unvaccinated patients the corresponding values were £168,318,709 and £112,534,130, respectively.\n\n\nConclusions\nAlthough vaccination rates in target groups have increased, many people are still not receiving influenza vaccination, and the burden of ILI in the United Kingdom remains substantial.\n\n Improving influenza vaccination uptake may have the potential to reduce this burden.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4546056","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

of global surveillance during an influenza pandemic","abstract":"Surveillance is an essential foundation for monitoring and evaluating any disease process, and is especially critical when new disease agents appear.\n The H1N1 influenza pandemic of 2009 tested the capacities of countries to detect, assess, notify and report events as required by the 2005 International Health Regulations (IHR).\n As detailed in the IHR, the World Health Organization drew on official reports from Member States as well as unofficial sources (e.\ng.\n media alerts) to quickly report and disseminate information about the appearance of the novel influenza virus.\n The pre-existing Global Influenza Surveillance Network for virological surveillance also provided crucial information for rapid development of a vaccine and for detection of changes in the virus.\n However, the pandemic also highlighted a number of shortcomings in global epidemiological surveillance for respiratory disease.\n These included the lack of standards for reporting illness, risk factor and mortality data, and a mechanism for systematic reporting of epidemiological data.\n Such measures would have facilitated direct comparison of data between countries and improved timely understanding of the characteristics and impact of the pandemic.\n This paper describes the surveillance strategies in place before the pandemic and the methods that were used at global level to monitor the pandemic.\n Enhancements of global surveillance are proposed to improve preparedness and response for similar events in the

an online survey of healthcare-seeking behaviour to estimate the magnitude and severity of the 2009 H1N1v influenza epidemic in England","abstract":"Background\nDuring the 2009 H1N1v influenza epidemic, the total number of symptomatic cases was estimated by combining influenza-like illness (ILI) consultations, virological surveillance and assumptions about healthcare-seeking behaviour.\n\n Changes in healthcare-seeking behaviour due to changing scientific information, media coverage and public anxiety, were not included in case estimates.\n\n The purpose of the study was to improve estimates of the number of symptomatic H1N1v cases and the case fatality rate (CFR) in England by quantifying healthcare-seeking behaviour using an internet-based survey carried out during the course of the 2009 H1N1v influenza epidemic.\n\n\nMethods\nWe used an online survey that ran continuously from July 2009 to March 2010 to estimate the proportion of ILI cases that sought healthcare during the 2009 H1N1v influenza epidemic.\n\n We used dynamic age- and gender-dependent measures of healthcare-seeking behaviour to re-interpret consultation numbers and estimate the true number of cases of symptomatic ILI in 2009 and the case fatality rate (CFR).\n\n\nResults\nThere were significant differences between age groups in healthcare usage.\n\n From the start to the end of the epidemic, the percentage of individuals with influenza-like symptoms who sought medical attention decreased from 43% to 32% (p &lt; 0.0001).\n\n Adjusting official numbers accordingly, we estimate that there were 1.1 million symptomatic cases in England, over 320,000 (40%) more cases than previously estimated and that the autumn epidemic wave was 45% bigger than previously thought.\n\n Combining symptomatic case numbers with reported deaths leads to a reduced overall CFR estimate of 17 deaths per 100,000 cases, with the largest reduction in adults.\n\n\nConclusions\nActive surveillance of healthcare-seeking behaviour, which can be achieved using novel data collection methods, is vital for providing accurate real-time estimates of epidemic size and disease severity.\n\n The differences in healthcare-seeking between different population groups and changes over time have significant implications for estimates of total case numbers and the case fatality rate.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3073914","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

as well as unusually severe influenza seasons (such as the 2012–2013 influenza season).\n Wikipedia usage accurately estimated the week of peak ILI activity 17% more often than Google Flu Trends data

burden as many cases do not access health care.\n\n Community cohorts have the advantage of not requiring individuals to present at hospitals and surgeries and therefore can potentially monitor a wider variety of cases.\n\n This study reports on the incidence and risk factors for ILI in the UK as measured using Flusurvey, an internet-based open community cohort.\n\n\nMethods\nUpon initial online registration participants were asked background characteristics, and every week were asked to complete a symptoms survey.\n\n We compared the representativeness of our sample to the overall population.\n\n We used two case definitions of ILI, which differed in whether fever/chills was essential.\n\n We calculated ILI incidence week by week throughout the season, and investigated risk factors associated with ever reporting ILI over the course of the season.\n\n Risk factor analysis was conducted using binomial regression.\n\n\nResults\n5943 participants joined the survey, and 4532 completed the symptoms survey at least twice.\n\n Participants who filled in symptoms surveys at least twice filled in a median of nine symptoms surveys over the course of the study.\n\n 46.1% of

Incidence peaked just before Christmas and declined dramatically during school holidays.\n\n Multivariate regression showed that, for both definitions of ILI considered, being female, unvaccinated, having underlying health issues, having contact with children, being aged between 35 and 64, and being a smoker were associated with the highest risk of reporting an ILI.\n\n The use of public transport was not associated with an increased risk of ILI.\n\n\nConclusions\nOur results show that internet based surveillance can be used to measure ILI and understand risk factors.\n\n Vaccination is shown to be linked to a reduced risk of reporting ILI.\n\n Taking public transport does not increase the risk of reporting ILI.\n\n Flusurvey and other participatory surveillance techniques can be

information about infections circulating in the community, yet to-date are limited to self-reported syndromic information only and lacking methods of linking symptom reports to infection types.\n We developed the GoViral platform to evaluate whether a cohort of lay volunteers could, and would find it useful to, contribute self-reported symptoms online and to compare specimen types for self-collected diagnostic information of sufficient quality for respiratory infection surveillance.\n Volunteers were recruited, given a kit (collection materials and customized instructions), instructed to report their symptoms weekly, and when sick with cold or flu-like symptoms, requested to collect specimens (saliva and nasal swab).\n We compared specimen types for respiratory virus detection sensitivity (via polymerase-chain-reaction) and ease of collection.\n Participants were surveyed to determine receptivity to participating when sick, to receiving information on the type of pathogen causing their infection and types circulating near them.\n Between December 1 2013 and March 1 2014, 295 participants enrolled in the study and received a kit.\n Of those who reported symptoms, half (71) collected and sent specimens for analysis.\n Participants submitted kits on average 2.30 days (95 CI: 1.65 to 2.96) after symptoms began.\n We found good concordance between nasal

the accuracy of self-testing by untrained participants compared to healthcare worker (HCW) testing, participants’ ability to interpret sample results and user-acceptability of self-tests in Singapore.\n\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nA cross-sectional study, involving 200 known HIV-positive patients and 794 unknown HIV status at-risk participants was conducted.\n\n Participants (all without prior self-test experience) performed self-testing guided solely by visual instructions, followed by HCW testing, both using the OraQuick ADVANCE Rapid HIV 1/2 Antibody Test, with both results

2010/2011 (December-March).\n\n Weekly emails were sent to the participants (n?=?84), reminding them to come to the study center in case of new symptoms.\n\n The participants self-collected an anterior nasal swab from one nostril, and trained study personnel collected one from the other nostril.\n\n The participants self-collected another two swabs (one from each nostril) on a subsequent

surveillance of Influenza-like-illness in the UK during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic","abstract":"Background\nInternet-based surveillance systems to monitor influenza-like illness (ILI) have advantages over traditional (physician-based) reporting systems, as they can potentially monitor a wider range of cases (i.\n\ne.\n\n including those that do not seek care).\n\n However, the requirement for participants to have internet access and to actively participate calls into question the representativeness of the data.\n\n Such systems have been in place in a number of European countries over the last few years, and in July 2009 this was extended to the UK.\n\n Here we present results of this survey with the aim of assessing the reliability of the data, and to evaluate methods to correct for possible biases.\n\n\nMethods\nInternet-based monitoring of ILI was launched near the peak of the first wave of the UK H1N1v influenza pandemic.\n\n We compared the recorded ILI incidence with physician-recorded incidence and an estimate of the true number of cases over the course of the epidemic.\n\n We also compared overall attack rates.\n\n The effect of using different ILI definitions and alternative denominator assumptions on incidence estimates was explored.\n\n\nResults\nThe crude incidence measured by the internet-based system appears to be influenced by individuals who participated only once in the survey and who appeared more likely to be ill.\n\n This distorted the overall incidence trend.\n\n Concentrating on individuals who reported more than once results in a time series of ILI incidence that matches the trend of case estimates reasonably closely, with a correlation of 0.713 (P-value: 0.0001, 95% CI: 0.435, 0.867).\n\n Indeed, the internet-based system appears to give a better estimate of the relative height of the two waves of the UK pandemic than the physician-recorded incidence.\n\n The overall attack rate is, however, higher than other estimates, at about 16% when compared with a model-based estimate of 6%.\n\n\nConclusion\nInternet-based monitoring of ILI can capture the trends in case numbers if appropriate weighting is used to correct for differential response.\n\n The overall level of incidence is, however, difficult to measure.\n\n Internet-based systems may be a useful adjunct to existing ILI surveillance systems as they capture cases that do not necessarily contact health care.\n\n However, further research is required before they can be used to accurately assess the absolute level of incidence in the community.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2988734","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Natasha

amongst individuals with influenza-like illness in an internet-based cohort","abstract":"Background\nSeasonal influenza epidemics place considerable strain on health services.\n\n Robust systems of surveillance are therefore required to ensure preparedness.\n\n Sentinel surveillance does not accurately capture the community burden of epidemics as it misses cases that do not present to health services.\n\n In this study, Flusurvey (an internet-based community surveillance tool) was used to examine how severity of disease influences health-seeking behaviour in the UK.\n\n\nMethods\nLogistic regression with random effects was used to investigate the association between health-seeking and symptom severity, duration of illness and reduction in self-reported health-score over four flu seasons between 2011 and 2015.\nResults\nThe majority of individuals did not seek care.\n\n In general, there was very strong evidence for an association between all severity indicators and visiting a health service (p &lt; 0.0001).\n\n Being female (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.23–2.14, p = 0.0003) and a self-diagnosis of the flu (OR 3.39, 95% CI 2.38–4.83, p &lt; 0.0001) were also associated with increased likelihood of visiting a health service.\n\n During the 2012–13 and 2014–15 flu seasons, there was a significantly larger proportion of individuals with more severe sets of symptoms and a longer duration of illness.\n\n Despite this, the proportion of individuals with particular sets of symptoms visiting a health service showed only very slight variation across years.\n\n\nConclusions\nTraditional surveillance systems capture only the more severe episodes of illness.\n\n However, in spite of variation in flu activity, the proportion of individuals visiting a

surveillance.\n\n Similarly to other surveillance systems and to studies using online data collection, Internet-based surveillance will have biases in participation, affecting the generalizability of the results.\n\n Here we quantify the participation biases of Influenzanet, an ongoing European-wide network of Internet-based participatory surveillance systems for influenza-like-illness.\n\n\nMethods\nIn 2011/2012 Influenzanet launched a standardized common framework for data collection applied to seven European countries.\n\n Influenzanet participants were compared to the general population of the participating countries to assess the representativeness of the sample in terms of a set of demographic, geographic, socio-economic and health indicators.\n\n\nResults\nMore than 30,000 European residents registered to the system in the 2011/2012 season, and a subset of 25,481 participants were selected for this study.\n\n All age classes (10 years brackets) were represented in the cohort, including under 10 and over 70 years old.\n\n The Influenzanet population was not representative of the general population in terms of age distribution, underrepresenting the youngest and oldest age classes.\n\n The gender imbalance differed between countries.\n\n A counterbalance between gender-specific information-seeking behavior (more prominent in women) and Internet usage (with higher rates in male populations) may be at the origin of this difference.\n\n Once adjusted by demographic indicators, a similar propensity to commute was observed for each country, and the same top three transportation modes were used for six countries out of seven.\n\n Smokers were underrepresented in the majority of countries, as were individuals with diabetes; the representativeness of asthma prevalence and vaccination coverage for 65+ individuals in two successive seasons (2010/2011 and 2011/2012) varied between countries.\n\n\nConclusions\nExisting demographic and national datasets allowed the quantification of the participation biases of a large cohort for influenza-like-illness surveillance in the general population.\n\n Significant differences were found between Influenzanet participants and the general population.\n\n The quantified biases need to be taken into account in the analysis of Influenzanet epidemiological studies and provide indications on populations groups that should be targeted in recruitment efforts.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article

Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed, and the results of the two specimens were compared.\n\n\nResults\nTwo-hundred pairs of samples were collected.\n\n Sixty-nine (34.5%) individuals were male, and the median (interquartile) age was 36 (28–48) years.\n\n Using nasopharyngeal and throat swab RT-PCR as the reference standard, the prevalence of COVID-19 diagnosed by nasopharyngeal and throat swab RT-PCR was 9.5%.\n\n The sensitivity and specificity of the saliva sample RT-PCR were 84.2% (95% CI 60.4%–96.6%), and 98.9% (95% CI 96.1%–99.9%), respectively.\n\n An analysis of the agreement between the two specimens demonstrated 97.5% observed agreement (? coefficient 0.851, 95% CI 0.723–0.979; p &lt; 0.001).\n\n\nConclusions\nSaliva might be an alternative specimen for the diagnosis of COVID-19. The collection is non-invasive, and non-aerosol generating.\n\n This method could facilitate the diagnosis of the disease, given the simplicity of specimen collection and good diagnostic performance.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7227531","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases.

characteristic (ROC) curves are useful tools to evaluate classifiers in biomedical and bioinformatics applications.\n\n However, conclusions are often reached through inconsistent use or insufficient statistical analysis.\n\n To support researchers in their ROC curves analysis we developed pROC, a package for R and S+ that contains a set of tools displaying, analyzing, smoothing and comparing ROC curves in a user-friendly, object-oriented and flexible interface.\n\n\nResults\nWith data previously imported into the R or S+ environment, the pROC package builds ROC curves and includes functions for computing confidence intervals, statistical tests for comparing total or partial area under the curve or the operating points of different classifiers, and methods for smoothing ROC curves.\n\n Intermediary and final results are visualised in user-friendly interfaces.\n\n A case study based on published clinical and biomarker data shows how to perform a typical ROC analysis with pROC.\n\n\nConclusions\npROC is a package for R and S+ specifically dedicated to ROC analysis.\n\n It proposes multiple statistical tests to compare ROC curves, and in particular partial areas under the curve, allowing proper ROC interpretation.\n\n pROC is available in two versions: in the R programming language or with a graphical user interface in the S+ statistical software.\n\n It is accessible at http://expasy.\n\norg/tools/pROC/ under the GNU General Public License.\n\n It is also distributed through the CRAN and CSAN public repositories, facilitating its

RT-PCR detects RNA, not infectious virus, thus its ability to determine duration of infectivity of patients is limited.\n\n Infectivity is a critical determinant in informing public health guidelines/interventions.\n\n Our goal was to determine the relationship between E gene SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values from respiratory samples, symptom onset to test (STT) and infectivity in cell culture.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective cross-sectional study, we took SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR confirmed positive samples and determined their ability to infect Vero cell lines.\n\n\nResults\nNinety RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 positive samples were incubated on Vero cells.\n\n Twenty-six samples (28.9%) demonstrated viral growth.\n\n Median TCID50/ml was 1780 (282-8511).\n\n There was no growth in samples with a Ct &gt; 24 or STT &gt; 8 days.\n\n Multivariate logistic regression using positive viral culture as a binary predictor variable, STT and Ct demonstrated an odds ratio for positive viral culture of 0.64 (95% CI 0.49-0.84, p&lt;0.001) for every one unit increase in Ct.\n\n Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for Ct vs.\n\n positive culture was OR 0.91 (95% CI 0.85-0.97, p&lt;0.001), with 97% specificity obtained at a Ct of &gt;24.\nConclusions\nSARS-CoV-2 Vero cell infectivity was only observed for RT-PCR Ct &lt; 24 and STT &lt; 8 days.\n\n Infectivity of patients with Ct &gt;24 and duration of symptoms &gt;8 days may be low.\n\n This information can inform public health policy and guide clinical, infection control and occupational health decisions.\n\n Further studies of larger size are needed.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7314198","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Oxford University

SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic people is an urgent priority for the prevention and containment of disease outbreaks in communities.\n\n However, few data are available in asymptomatic persons regarding the accuracy of PCR testing.\n\n Additionally, although self-collected saliva has significant logistical advantages in mass screening, its utility as an alternative specimen in asymptomatic persons is yet to be determined.\n\n\nMethods\nWe conducted a mass-screening study to compare the utility of nucleic acid amplification, such as reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing, using nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) and saliva samples from each individual in two cohorts of asymptomatic persons: the contact tracing cohort and the airport quarantine cohort.\n\n\nResults\nIn this mass-screening study including 1,924 individuals, the sensitivity of nucleic acid amplification testing with nasopharyngeal and saliva specimens were 86% (90%CI:77-93%) and 92% (90%CI:83-97%), respectively, with specificities greater than 99.9%.\n\n The true concordance probability between the nasopharyngeal and saliva tests was estimated at 0.998 (90%CI:0.996-0.999) on the estimated airport prevalence at 0.3%.\n\n In positive individuals, viral load was highly correlated between NPS and saliva.\n\n\nConclusion\nBoth nasopharyngeal and saliva specimens had high sensitivity and specificity.\n\n Self-collected saliva is a valuable specimen to detect SARS-CoV-2 in mass screening of asymptomatic persons.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7543374","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Oxford University
