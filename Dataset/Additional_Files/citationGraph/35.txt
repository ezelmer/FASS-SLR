Recently, Wang et al reported the existence of myocardial injury in 7.2% of all patients with COVID-19 and in 22.2% of patients admitted to the intensive care unit versus only 2.0% patients not treated in the intensive care unit. Thus, we hypothesized that cardiac troponin I (cTNI), an established biomarker of cardiac injury, may be a clinical predictor of outcomes for patients with COVID-19.\nPatients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to Union Hospital (West Campus), Huazhong University of Science and Technology from January 12 to March 12, 2020, were enrolled, and the final date of follow-up was March 20, 2020. This study was approved by the ethics committee of Union Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology ([2020]0087) and conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was waived by the ethics commission based on the retrospective nature of the study and the emerging worldwide crisis caused by this infectious disease.\nA total of 311 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases were included on the basis of available cTNI concentrations measured during hospitalization. The data of laboratory and imaging tests performed for the first time after admission were used for analysis. The ARCHITECTSTAT high-sensitivity troponin I assay (Abbott Laboratories) was used to measure cTnI concentrations. Cardiac injury was diagnosed if the level of serum cTNI with at least 1 value was above the 99th percentile upper reference limit during hospitalization. We defined the severity of COVID-19 on admission by using the Chinese management guideline for COVID-19 (version 6.0). The primary composite end point was all-cause death. The included patients were assigned to 1 of 2 groups according to clinical outcomes: the discharged group and the nonsurvivor group. To explore the risk factors associated with mortality, univariable and then multivariable logistic regression models (backward elimination) were applied. We chose age, sex, comorbidity, body temperature, blood oxygen saturation, disease severity, lymphocyte count, D-dimer, C-reactive protein, and cTNI as the 10 variables for our multivariable logistic regression model on the basis of our univariable analysis results and previous findings. With the exception of age and blood oxygen saturation, the continuous variables of laboratory and imaging indicators were included with log2 transformation and report odds ratio (OR) per doubling of concentration (Table). A 2-tailed P&lt;0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. All analyses were performed with SPSS version 13.0 (SPSS).\nRisk Factors for Mortality in Patients With COVID-19 by Univariable and Multivariable Analysis\nFor 311 included patients, the median age was 63 years (interquartile range [IQR], 54-70 years), and 190 (61.1%) patients were male. Overall, 62.7% of patients had at least 1 comorbidity, including hypertension, cardiovascular disease (coronary heart disease/arrhythmia/heart failure), cerebrovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, malignancy, chronic kidney disease, and thyroid disease. The most common symptoms on admission were fever (77.5%), cough (32.5%), and dyspnea (24.4%). With regard to disease severity on admission, there were 101 patients (32.5%) with moderate-type, 180 (57.9%) with severe-type, and 30 (9.6%) with critical-type COVID-19. One hundred eleven patients died during hospitalization and 200 were discharged. The median time from illness onset to death was 23 days (IQR, 15-32 days). In laboratory findings, the lymphocyte count (0.5x109/L [IQR, 0.4-0.8x109/L] versus 1.2x109/L [IQR, 0.9-1.7x109/L]) was lower in the nonsurvivor group than in the discharged group. The concentrations of D-dimer (4.0 microg/mL [IQR, 1.2-8.0 microg/mL] versus 0.5 microg/mL [IQR, 0.2-1.5microg/mL]), C-reactive protein (80.2 mg/L [IQR, 48.4-121.8 mg/L] versus 8.1 mg/L [IQR, 2.4-43.6 mg/L]), and cTNI (32.5 ng/L [IQR, 11.4-304.4 ng/L] versus 2.8 ng/L [IQR, 1.5-5.8 ng/L]) in the nonsurvivor group were elevated in comparison with those in the discharged group. There were 103 patients (33.1%) with cardiac injury, including 12 patients in the discharged group and 91 patients in the nonsurvivor group. Multivariable logistic regression analysis identified cTNI concentration (OR, 1.92 [95% CI, 1.41-2.59]), lymphocyte count (OR, 0.52 [95% CI, 0.29-0.95]), C-reactive protein concentration (OR, 1.98 [95% CI, 1.34-2.92]), D-dimer concentration (OR, 1.55 [95% CI, 1.13-2.13]), comorbidity (OR, 9.07 [95% CI, 2.52-32.66]), and blood oxygen saturation (OR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.77-0.94]) as independent risk factors for death in patients with COVID-19 (Table).\nAlthough respiratory symptoms are the primary clinical manifestations of COVID-19, a portion of patients will experience severe cardiovascular injury. cTnI is the most important biomarker of cardiac injury. Our results indicate that the serum cTnI concentration was significantly higher in nonsurviving patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection than in discharged patients, and the further multivariable logistic regression identified increased cTnI concentration as an independent predictor of mortality in patients with COVID-19.\nThis study is limited by selection bias based on cTnI measurement. The determination of whether cTnI would be measured in each case was an individual decision by the clinician. The results do not totally represent the epidemiological data of COVID-19.\nDisclosures\nNone.\nDrs Nie, Yu, and Xie contributed equally.\nhttps://www.ahajournals.org/journal/circ\nThe data that

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU

Outcomes seem to be improving over time, potentially suggesting improvements in care.\nIntroduction\nOn 31 December 2019, China announced a cluster of novel pneumonia-like illness. The causative organism, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2), has to date infected more than 4.8 million people globally and been responsible for more than 318 000 known deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). The virus has resulted in a pandemic.\nThough several reports from China,  Italy,  and most recently the United States   have described some characteristics of people with covid-19, little is understood about factors associated with hospital admission and severe disease. Studies so far have included few people with severe outcomes      or have not compared people with severe disease with those with less virulent disease,   making it difficult to assess characteristics associated with poor outcomes. Few large studies have conducted multivariable regression to help identify the strongest risk factors.\nNew York City is now the epicenter of the covid-19 outbreak in the US, with more than 190 000 known cases in the city and more than 15 000 confirmed deaths as of 19 May: more than anywhere else in the country. We describe the characteristics of people with covid-19 treated at a large quaternary academic health system in New York City and Long Island, and the association of these characteristics with adverse outcomes.\nMethods\nStudy setting\nThe study was conducted at NYU Langone Health, which includes more than 260 outpatient office sites and four acute care hospitals (Tisch Hospital and NYU Langone Orthopedic Hospital in Manhattan, NYU Langone Hospital - Brooklyn in Brooklyn, and NYU Winthrop on Long Island), ranging from a quaternary care hospital to a safety net institution. As the epidemic evolved, the health system added intensive care unit (ICU) beds and inpatient capacity, resulting in a peak of about 394 ICU beds and 1357 non-ICU beds.\nStudy cohort\nWe identified all patients who were tested for SARS-Cov-2 between 1 March 2020 and 8 April 2020. We then created a cohort of those with confirmed covid-19, defined as a positive result on real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab specimens. Initial tests were conducted by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene; as of 16 March, tests were conducted in our clinical laboratory using the Roche SARS-CoV2 assay in the Cobas 6800 instruments through emergency use authorization granted by the US Food and Drug Administration. On 31 March, we added testing using the SARS-CoV2 Xpert Xpress assay in the Cepheid GeneXpert instruments also under emergency use authorization by the FDA. The targets amplified by these assays are the ORF1/a and E genes in the Roche Cobas assay and N2 and E genes in the Cepheid XpertXpress. After 16 March, only nasopharyngeal samples were collected and tested.\nTesting was performed on people presenting to the emergency department who were likely to be admitted with any symptom or sign consistent with covid-19, including fever, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, gastrointestinal problems, syncope, known exposure to a patient positive for covid-19, or clinician concern. In addition, ambulatory testing was available by appointment with clinician's referral until 26 March 2020, when New York state recommended restricting testing of people with mild or moderate illness. Outpatient testing of symptomatic or concerned employees remained available throughout the study period. Repeat testing of negative specimens was conducted at clinician discretion. If testing was repeated and discordant (ie, negative test followed by a positive test), we used the positive result.\nFrom the covid-19 cohort we excluded 287 people who were not admitted to hospital, were missing all data besides age and sex, and had no previous visits within the health system. We obtained complete follow up on the covid-19 cohort through 5 May 2020.\nData sources\nStudy data were obtained from the electronic health record (Epic Systems, Verona, WI), which is an integrated electronic health record including all inpatient and outpatient visits in the health system. For data on tobacco use, body mass index (BMI), and comorbidities, we included any data in the electronic health record, including data entered during previous inpatient or outpatient visits in the problem list, medical history section, or on encounter diagnoses.\nMain outcomes\nWe assessed three primary outcomes: inpatient hospital admissions; critical illness, defined as a composite of care in the intensive care unit, use of mechanical ventilation, discharge to hospice, or death; and discharge to hospice or death among those admitted to hospital. We assessed outcomes longitudinally over the entire study period, not just at the time of the initial testing event. For patients with multiple visits, the most severe outcome was assigned. For instance, patients who did not need hospital admission at the time of initial testing but were later admitted were assigned to the hospital group. Similarly, patients who were initially admitted and discharged and then readmitted requiring invasive ventilation were assigned to the critical illness group.\nPredictors\nWe obtained several variables from the electronic health record: age at time of testing, sex, race/ethnicity as reported by the patient (aggregated into non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic African-American, Asian, Hispanic, other/multiracial, and unknown), and history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, heart failure, pulmonary disease (defined by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma), malignancy (excluding non-metastatic non-melanoma skin cancer), diabetes, and obesity (defined by most recent BMI). We also obtained vital signs and the first set of laboratory results when available. For multivariable modeling, we grouped vital sign and laboratory results into categories by degree of abnormality based on clinical judgment because of non-linear associations with outcome. We selected these predictors based on previous published literature  and our clinical experience of patients with covid-19.\nStatistical analysis\nWe used descriptive statistics to characterize each cohort of patients: those not admitted to hospital, all those admitted, those admitted without critical illness, and those with critical illness (care in ICU, mechanical ventilation, discharge to hospice, or death). We then fitted multivariable logistic regression models with admission and with critical illness as the outcomes to identify factors associated with those outcomes. In analyses using hospital admission as the outcome, we included only patient characteristics and comorbidities, since 77% of the patients who were not admitted were evaluated in ambulatory testing centers and did not have vitals or laboratory studies collected. For the critical illness analyses, we included the above predictors and for one of the models added temperature and oxygen saturation on presentation, as well as the first result of C reactive protein, D-dimer, ferritin, procalcitonin, and troponin when obtained. We included all selected predictors based on a priori clinical significance after testing for collinearity using the variance inflation factor and ensuring none had a variance inflation factor greater than 2. We also tested for overall multicollinearity among all variables simultaneously using the determinant of correlation matrix implemented in R's mctest library and found no significant results. \nFor the admission model, we included all patients testing positive (excluding the 287 patients with no data besides age and sex). We constructed two models for association with critical illness. First, we constructed a model restricted to patients admitted to hospital, including all personal and comorbidity predictors, and a random effect for hospital to account for clustering by facility. Second, we added to that model vital signs and the first set of laboratory results, to assess clinical associations with critical illness among patients admitted to hospital. We excluded from the second model four patients who died in the emergency department before vital signs or laboratory results could be collected. We obtained odds ratios from the models and profiled confidence intervals for the odds ratios using the approach of Venables and Ripley, since assuming normality of the maximum likelihood estimate to estimate Wald-type confidence intervals can lead to biased estimates. We also calculated average marginal effects for each predictor by using the margins library in R, which uses a discrete first difference in predicted outcomes to obtain the average marginal effect.\nFinally, we fitted a competing risk model for the mortality or hospice outcome with time from first positive test result as the start point, including only patients admitted to hospital. We considered discharge from hospital to be a competing risk, since mortality data are limited after that point unless the patient is readmitted to our system (in which case the newest hospital admission would be included). Patients still in hospital as of 5 May 2020 were counted as censored. The model was fitted with the R library cmprisk, and the proportionality assumption was checked with the goffte library. We fitted two competing risk models, one adjusting for personal characteristics and comorbidities, and one adding admission vitals and laboratory studies.\nAll statistical analyses were conducted with R, version 3.6.3. All analyses used two sided statistical tests and we considered a P value less than 0.05 to be statistically significant without adjustment for multiple testing.\nPatient and public involvement\nPatients and the public were not a priori involved in the design and conduct of the study, the choice of outcomes, recruitment, or planned dissemination. However, we incorporated many comments from the public on an earlier preprint version of the paper into the final analysis.\nResults\nDuring the study period, the health system tested 11 544 people for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2). Of those tested, 5566 (48.2%) were positive and 287 were excluded for lack of data. Of the remaining 5279 patients testing positive, 2538 (48.1%) were treated only as outpatients through the end of the study period, and 2741 (51.9%) required admission to hospital. Nearly all those admitted to the hospital (2729, 99.6%) experienced a study outcome: 1739/2741 (63.4%) were discharged without critical illness and 990/2741 (36.1%) experienced critical illness, including 665/2741 (24.3%) who were discharged to a hospice or died to date.\nAmong the 990 patients with critical illness, 647 (65.4%) required mechanical ventilation, 102 (10.3%) required intensive care without mechanical ventilation, and 241 (24.3%) were discharged to a hospice or died without either intensive care or mechanical ventilation. Figure 1 shows the final outcomes to date for each subgroup.\nFlow diagram of included participants. Covid-19=coronavirus disease 2019\nCharacteristics of study population\nThe median age of the study population that tested positive for covid-19 was 54 years (interquartile range 38-66 years), and 2615 (49.5%) were men. A total of 1195 (22.6%) had diabetes, 1865 (35.3%) were obese (BMI &gt;=30), and 2752 (52.1%) had any form of cardiovascular disease. Among patients admitted to hospital, the median length of stay was 7 days (interquartile range 3-13; full range 0-52 days). Median length of stay for those still in hospital with critical illness (n=160) was 36 days (32-40, full range 3-52 days). See appendix table S1 for characteristics of those who tested negative. Among tests performed in the emergency department, 83.9% were for patients who were admitted and 16.1% were for patients who were discharged (see appendix tables S2 and S3). Appendix table S4 shows the characteristics of patients seen in the emergency department for suspected covid-19 but who were not tested.\nPeople admitted to hospital were more likely to be men (61.2% v 36.9%) and were considerably more likely to have comorbidities than people not admitted (any comorbidity, 79.7% v 44.8%), particularly cardiovascular disease (70.6% v 32.2%), diabetes (34.7% v 9.7%), and chronic kidney disease (21.2% v 2.6%; table 1). Differences in sex and comorbidities between admitted patients experiencing critical illness and those who did not were much smaller. Among these patients, differences in clinical presentation and laboratory results were more prominent. Patients with critical illness more often presented with hypoxia (initial oxygen saturation 25th centile 86% v 92%), and had higher initial levels of C reactive protein (median 136.3 v 89.1), D-dimer (median 528 v 324), ferritin (median 925 v 613), procalcitonin (0.27 v 0.10), and troponin (0.07 v 0.02; table 2).\nCharacteristics of people with coronavirus disease 2019 by hospital admission status and multivariable risk of hospital admission.

Risk of critical illness declined progressively as the study period progressed, with the lowest being in the last week (0.4, 0.2 to 0.6).\nMultivariable logistic regression results for risk of critical illness among inpatients with coronavirus disease 2019 discharged or with critical illness\nCharacteristics 	Unadjusted odds ratio (95% CI) (n=2725)	Excluding vital signs and laboratory results (n=2725)		Including vital signs and laboratory results (n=2725)	 	Adjusted odds ratio (95% CI)	P value	Adjusted odds ratio (95% CI)	P value	 	Week:							 	 10-11 (2-15 March)	Reference	Reference	: 		Reference	 :	 	 12 (16-22 March)	0.70 (0.42 to 1.19)	0.76 (0.44 to 1.3)	0.32		0.49 (0.25 to 1.0)	0.04	 	 13 (23-29 March)	0.60 (0.36 to 0.99)	0.58 (0.35 to 1.0)	0.05		0.21 (0.10 to 0.4)	&lt;0.001	 	 14 (30 March to 5 April)	0.58 (0.35 to 0.95)	0.55 (0.33 to 0.9)	0.03		0.16 (0.08 to 0.3)	&lt;0.001	 	 15 (6-8 April)	0.42 (0.25 to 0.72)	0.37 (0.21 to 0.6)	&lt;0.001		0.08 (0.04 to 0.2)	&lt;0.001	 	Age (years):							 	 19-44	Reference	Reference	:		Reference	:	 	 45-54	1.18 (0.86 to 1.64)	1.12 (0.80 to 1.6)	0.50		0.78 (0.54 to 1.1)	0.21	 	 55-64	2.01 (1.51 to 2.68)	2.04 (1.50 to 2.8)	&lt;0.001		1.32 (0.93 to 1.9)	0.12	 	 65-74	2.81 (2.12 to 3.72)	2.88 (2.09 to 4.0)	&lt;0.001		1.73 (1.19 to 2.5)	0.004	 	 &gt;=75	3.64 (2.76 to 4.79)	3.46 (2.46 to 4.8)	&lt;0.001		2.32 (1.57 to 3.4)	&lt;0.001	 	Men	1.40 (1.19 to 1.64)	1.54 (1.29 to 1.8)	&lt;0.001		1.06 (0.85 to 1.3)	0.60	 	Race/ethnicity:							 	 Non-Hispanic white	Reference	Reference	:		Reference	:	 	 Non-Hispanic African-American	0.60 (0.47 to 0.77)	0.67 (0.51 to 0.9)	0.004		0.57 (0.41 to 0.8)	0.001	 	 Asian	1.10 (0.80 to 1.51)	1.30 (0.92 to 1.8)	0.13		1.24 (0.82 to 1.9)	0.30	 	 Hispanic	0.72 (0.59 to 0.87)	0.93 (0.74 to 1.2)	0.54		0.89 (0.69 to 1.2)	0.38	 	 Other/multiracial	0.90 (0.67 to 1.21)	1.15 (0.84 to 1.6)	0.39		1.24 (0.86 to 1.8)	0.25	 	 Unknown	1.03 (0.69 to 1.53)	1.23 (0.80 to 1.9)	0.34		1.10 (0.68 to 1.8)	0.70	 	Smoking status:							 	 Never	Reference	Reference	:		Reference	:	 	 Former	1.50 (1.23 to 1.82)	1.06 (0.85 to 1.3)	0.59		1.05 (0.82 to 1.3)	0.72	 	 Current	0.94 (0.65 to 1.36)	0.77 (0.52 to 1.2)	0.21		0.82 (0.53 to 1.3)	0.39	 	 Unknown	1.58 (1.27 to 1.96)	1.52 (1.19 to 1.9)	0.001		1.42 (1.08 to 1.9)	0.01	 	BMI:							 	 &lt;25	Reference	Reference	:		Reference	:	 	 25.0-29.9	0.77 (0.62 to 0.94)	0.86 (0.69 to 1.1)	0.18		0.94 (0.73 to 1.2)	0.65	 	 30.0-39.9	0.73 (0.59 to 0.90)	0.98 (0.77 to 1.2)	0.85		1.11 (0.85 to 1.5)	0.44	 	 &gt;=40	0.87 (0.63 to 1.22)	1.52 (1.04 to 2.2)	0.03		1.71 (1.10 to 2.7)	0.02	 	 Unknown	0.86 (0.51 to 1.44)	0.80 (0.46 to 1.4)	0.43		1.05 (0.54 to 2.0)	0.89	 	Coronary artery disease	1.69 (1.41 to 2.03)	0.96 (0.77 to 1.2)	0.76		0.92 (0.71 to 1.2)	0.56	 	Heart failure	2.34 (1.87 to 2.94)	1.88 (1.43 to 2.5)	&lt;0.001		1.93 (1.40 to 2.6)	&lt;0.001	 	Hyperlipidemia	1.35 (1.15 to 1.58)	0.94 (0.77 to 1.1)	0.50		0.93 (0.75 to 1.2)	0.51	 	Hypertension	1.59 (1.34 to 1.87)	0.96 (0.77 to 1.2)	0.67		0.96 (0.75 to 1.2)	0.76	 	Diabetes	1.38 (1.17 to 1.62)	1.24 (1.03 to 1.5)	0.03		1.23 (0.99 to 1.5)	0.06	 	Asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease	1.07 (0.87 to 1.32)	0.89 (0.70 to 1.1)	0.35		0.99 (0.76 to 1.3)	0.93	 	Chronic kidney disease	1.57 (1.30 to 1.89)	1.07 (0.85 to 1.3)	0.54		0.73 (0.55 to 1.0)	0.04	 	Cancer	1.68 (1.31 to 2.14)	1.23 (0.95 to 1.6)	0.12		1.30 (0.95 to 1.8)	0.10	 	Temperature on presentation ( C):							 	 &lt;38	Reference	:	:		Reference	 :	 	 38-39	1.05 (0.86 to 1.28)	:	:		1.08 (0.85 to 1.4)	0.52	 	 &gt;39	1.06 (0.83 to 1.37)	:	:		1.06 (0.78 to 1.4)	0.71	 	Oxygen saturation on presentation (%):							 	 &gt;92	Reference	:	:		Reference	: 	 	 88-92	1.67 (1.38 to 2.03)	:	:		1.49 (1.18 to 1.9)	0.001	 	 &lt;88	5.57 (4.42 to 7.02)	:	:		3.67 (2.78 to 4.8)	&lt;0.001	 	First lymphocyte count (103/muL;

the increased risk of admission was eliminated once emergency department treat-and-release patients were included (appendix table S5). Non-Hispanic African-American patients had a risk of admission similar to white patients and a lower risk of critical illness (0.7, 0.5 to 0.9).\nAfter adding admission vital signs and first set of laboratory results to the critical illness model, only age, heart failure, and BMI greater than 40 remained associated with significant risks; in this model, the factors most associated with critical illness were oxygen saturation on admission less than 88% (3.7, 2.8 to 4.8), troponin level greater than 1 (4.8, 2.1 to 10.9), C reactive protein level greater than 200 (5.1, 2.8 to 9.2), and D-dimer level greater than 2500 (3.9, 2.6 to 6.0; table 3).\nThe competing risk mortality analysis showed similar characteristics to confer increased hazard as the critical illness model, but fewer were significant. The hazard ratio increased proportionally by age: 10.3 (95% confidence interval 6.4 to 16.8) for age 75 years or older.

Of 5279 adults, 2741 required hospital admission; and 990 required intensive care or mechanical ventilation, were discharged to hospice care, or died. A total of 94% of patients admitted to hospital have been discharged alive or to hospice care or have died, providing robust final outcome results. We find particularly strong associations of older age, male sex, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and obesity with hospital admission and risk of critical illness among all patients with covid-19, with less influence of chronic pulmonary disease (asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and other forms of heart disease. By contrast, we found comorbidities to be less strongly associated with critical illness in patients admitted to hospital. Among those patients, we noted the importance of hypoxia despite the provision of supplemental oxygen and early increases in inflammatory markers (especially D-dimer and C reactive protein) in distinguishing between patients who go on to develop critical illness and those who do not. In the population admitted to hospital, measures of inflammation were much more important than personal characteristics and comorbidities.\nComparison with other studies\nThe first detailed covid-19 case series included 1099 hospital inpatients with laboratory confirmed infection in China, of whom only 25 (2.3%) underwent invasive ventilation and 15 (1.4%) died. A recent report of 5700 patients admitted to hospital from a different health system in New York City found that at least 9.7% had already died (24.5% of mechanically ventilated patients); however, 53.8% of the patients in this study (72.2% of ventilated) were still in hospital, with a median follow-up of only 4.5 days. By contrast, 23.6% of patients admitted to hospital in our case series required invasive ventilation and 24.3% have died as of 5 May, with 94% of patients having completed hospital admissions. If all remaining inpatients died, the overall mortality would be a maximum of 30.5%. Given the high prevalence of disease in New York City and the relative paucity of baseline hospital beds per capita (1.5-2.7 beds per 1000 in all boroughs except Manhattan), admission thresholds might be higher in New York City than in China (4.2 beds per 1000).  Moreover, in the series from China, only a quarter of the patients had any chronic comorbidity, whereas in our series 80% of patients admitted to hospital had at least one of eight major chronic diseases. \nIn fact, outcomes in most of the reports were similar to ours. A commentary by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention described outcomes for 72 314 patients, of whom 14% had severe disease (similar to patients admitted to hospital in our series) and 5% had critical illness with respiratory or multi-organ failure (similar to those requiring intensive care unit (ICU) level care or mechanical ventilation in our series). Among patients with critical illness, mortality was 49%; we found this to be 57% among all ICU or ventilated patients. Finally, our results are also consistent with a recent national case series reported by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which found that 457 of 1037 (44.1%) patients admitted to hospital required ICU admission, and that three quarters had at least one chronic condition. Overall, the death rate we find for critically ill patients is a bit higher than the typical mortality rate from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) of about 35-45%.  \nThe comorbidities we identified as associated with hospital admission in covid-19 are largely similar to those associated with any type of severe infectious disease requiring hospital admission or ICU level care, though we were surprised that chronic pulmonary disease did not feature more prominently. Others have also noted the absence of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as risks for severity of illness in patients with covid-19. The epidemiologic and/or pathophysiologic reasons for this are unknown. The demographic distribution of patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 is also similar to those admitted with other acute respiratory infections. For instance, though advanced age was by far the most important predictor of hospital admission and severe outcomes (as it is for most illnesses), 53% of patients admitted to hospital were younger than 65 years. This is typical of the pattern for hospital admissions in viral respiratory disease. Studies of patients admitted to hospital with influenza in the United States have found that people younger than 65 years (including children) account for 53-57% of influenza related hospital admissions.  \nSurprisingly, though some have speculated that high rates of smoking in China explained some of the morbidity in those patients, we did not find tobacco use to be associated with increased risk of hospital admission or of critical illness; in fact, it even seemed protective for hospital admission. However, this could be artifactual: patients with unknown smoking status had significantly higher risks of admission and of critical illness. It is possible that data are disproportionately missing for current or former smokers who might not care to answer that question; if so, that would attenuate the apparent benefit of smoking. Few (&lt;5%) patients had a recorded history of vaping; separate analyses could not be conducted for this group.\nWe noted a striking association of inflammatory markers with mortality and critical illness among patients admitted to hospital; particularly, early increases in C reactive protein and D-dimer levels. Hyperinflammatory states are well described in severe sepsis; however, the degree to which covid-19 related inflammation is similar to or different from that typically found in sepsis is unknown. Some emerging case reports suggest that patients with severe covid-19 disease are developing complications from hypercoagulability, including both pulmonary emboli and microscopic thrombi. It is notable that one of the chronic conditions strongly associated with critical illness was obesity. Obesity is well recognized to be a pro-inflammatory condition.  In addition, this might explain why hyperlipidemia seemed protective for hospital admission in multivariable analysis, though not in univariate analysis and not for critical illness: statin treatment is anti-inflammatory and has been shown to reduce cytokine levels. Some studies suggest that an increased low density lipoprotein cholesterol level itself might be beneficial in reducing mortality from respiratory diseases through direct anti-infectious properties, though mean low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were low in our population. Finally, we noted that early increases in procalcitonin levels were strongly associated with critical illness and mortality, although covid-19 appears to be characterized by low procalcitonin levels in general. Though many patients with increased procalcitonin levels and critical illness were treated with antibiotics, it remains unclear whether these patients actually had bacterial disease or whether the increase in procalcitonin levels was another manifestation of a general hyperinflammatory state.\nLast, we were interested to note that, while risk of hospital admission was constant across the study period, risk of critical illness (and directionally, but not significantly, mortality) decreased over time. Our institution was stretched but not overwhelmed by the epidemic and did not experience important equipment or treatment shortages. The improvement in outcomes over time (in the setting of a functioning health system) raises the possibility that familiarity with the disease, ongoing iteration of protocols and practices in response to observed outcomes, and initiation of new treatments might improve outcomes even in the absence of vaccination or regimens known to be effective.\nLimitations of this study\nThis study has several limitations. Most important, data on patients who were not admitted to hospital were more limited because many did not have vital signs or blood samples collected and might not have had as detailed a medical history taken. They are also a heterogeneous group, made even more heterogeneous by changing testing thresholds over time. We might therefore have overestimated the importance of chronic disease in risk of hospital admission. This limitation could be further exacerbated by the fact that patients treated and discharged from the emergency department were not commonly tested and thus omitted from our analysis unless later admitted to hospital, yet they might be more likely to have comorbidities than those tested in outpatient settings. However, a sensitivity analysis including these patients showed similar results. Our patients were all from a single geographic region, treated within a single health system; factors associated with poor outcomes might differ elsewhere, though our patient population is diverse. We did not have data on inflammatory markers available for patients not admitted to hospital; it is possible that these would have been associated with risk of hospital admission, not just critical illness, if available. Moreover, a standardized admission laboratory protocol was only established about two weeks into the epidemic, resulting in missing laboratory data for earlier patients, especially those who were less acutely ill. Finally, our outcome assignments might be imperfect: some patients in the group who were not admitted to hospital might have been admitted to other institutions, and some discharged patients might have been readmitted elsewhere with critical illness or could have died post-discharge.\nConclusion\nOverall, we found that age and comorbidities are powerful predictors of requirement for admission to hospital rather than outpatient care; however, degree of oxygen impairment and markers of inflammation are most strongly associated with poor outcomes during hospital admission. Clinicians should consider routinely obtaining inflammatory markers during hospital stay for people with covid-19.\nWhat is already known on this topic\nDemographics and prevalence of comorbidities in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), particularly those admitted to hospital, have been described in several countries\nEarly outcomes of people with critical illness have been described but usually include a substantial portion of patients still with incomplete follow-up\nIt is uncertain which characteristics, comorbidities, and laboratory results are associated with an increase in risk for adverse outcomes\nWhat this study adds\nIn this study of people with covid-19 tested and treated at a health system in New York City the overall mortality rate for patients admitted to hospital was between 24% and 30%\nAge, heart failure, male sex, chronic kidney disease, and obesity were associated with hospital admission and development of critical illness once admitted\nHypoxia and increased inflammatory laboratory studies early in hospital admission were important markers for adverse events\nExtra material supplied by authors\nContributors: CMP, LO'D, KAT, RJC, FF, and LIH conceived the project.

considered as high-priority subjects for COVID-19 vaccination.\n\n We report on the compliance with the COVID-19 vaccine of patients affected by solid tumours.\n\n\nMaterials and methods\nPatients with cancer afferent to Medical Oncology 1 Unit of Regina Elena National Cancer Institute in Rome were considered eligible for vaccination if they were receiving systemic immunosuppressive antitumor treatment or received it in the last 6 months or having an uncontrolled advanced disease.\n\n The Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine was proposed to all candidates via phone or during a scheduled visit.\n\n The reasons for refusal were collected by administrating a 6-item multiple-choice questionnaire.\n\n\nResults\nFrom 1st March to 20th March 2021, of 914 eligible patients, 102 refused vaccination (11.2%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 9.1–13.2).\n\n The most frequent (&gt;10%) reasons reported were concerns about vaccine-related adverse events (48.1%), negative interaction with concomitant antitumor therapy (26.7%), and the fear of allergic reaction (10.7%).\n\n The refusal rate (RR) after 15th March (date of AstraZeneca-AZD1222 suspension) was more than doubled compared with the RR observed before (19.7% versus 8.6%, odds ratio [OR] 2.60, 95% CI 1.69–3.99; P &lt; 0.0001).\n\n ECOG-PS 2 was associated with higher RR compared with ECOG-PS 0-1 (OR 2.94, 95% CI 1.04–8.34; P = 0.04).\n\n No statistically significant differences in RR according to other clinical characteristics were found.\n\n\nConclusions\nOur experience represents the first worldwide report on the adherence of patients with cancer to COVID-19 vaccination and underlines how regulatory decisions and media news spreading could influence the success of the campaign.\n\n\n","id":"PMC8149194","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Vincenzo","surname":"Di

disease 2019 (Covid-19), have spread to millions of persons worldwide.\n\n Multiple vaccine candidates are under development, but no vaccine is currently available.\n\n Interim safety and immunogenicity data about the vaccine candidate BNT162b1 in younger adults have been reported previously from trials in Germany and the United States.\n\n\nMethods\nIn an ongoing, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded, dose-escalation, phase 1 trial conducted in the United States, we randomly assigned healthy adults 18 to 55 years of age and those 65 to 85 years of age to receive either placebo or one of two lipid nanoparticle–formulated, nucleoside-modified RNA vaccine candidates: BNT162b1, which encodes a secreted trimerized SARS-CoV-2 receptor–binding domain; or BNT162b2, which encodes a membrane-anchored SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike, stabilized in the prefusion conformation.\n\n The primary outcome was safety (e.\n\ng.\n\n, local and systemic reactions and adverse events); immunogenicity was a secondary outcome.\n\n Trial groups were defined according to vaccine candidate, age of the participants, and vaccine dose level (10 ?g, 20 ?g, 30 ?g, and 100 ?g).\n\n In all groups but one, participants received two doses, with a 21-day interval between doses; in one group (100 ?g of BNT162b1), participants received one dose.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 195 participants underwent randomization.\n\n In each of 13 groups of 15 participants, 12 participants received vaccine and 3 received placebo.\n\n BNT162b2 was associated with a lower incidence and severity of systemic reactions than BNT162b1, particularly in older adults.\n\n In both younger and older adults, the two vaccine candidates elicited similar dose-dependent SARS-CoV-2–neutralizing geometric mean titers, which were similar to or higher than the geometric mean titer of a panel of SARS-CoV-2 convalescent serum samples.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe safety and immunogenicity data from this U.\n\nS.\n\n phase 1 trial of two vaccine candidates in younger and older adults, added to earlier interim safety and immunogenicity data regarding BNT162b1 in younger adults from trials in Germany and the United States, support the selection of BNT162b2 for advancement to a pivotal phase 2–3 safety and efficacy evaluation.\n\n (Funded by BioNTech and Pfizer; ClinicalTrials.\n\ngov number,

disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and

and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had

survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%)

Each patient had at least 14 days of follow-up.\n\n\nResults\nWe identified 24 patients with confirmed Covid-19. The mean (±SD) age of the patients was 64±18 years, 63% were men, and symptoms began 7±4 days before admission.\n\n The most common symptoms were cough and shortness of breath; 50% of patients had fever on admission, and 58% had diabetes mellitus.\n\n All the patients were admitted for hypoxemic respiratory failure; 75% (18 patients) needed mechanical ventilation.\n\n Most of the patients (17) also had hypotension and needed vasopressors.\n\n No patient tested positive for influenza A, influenza B, or other respiratory viruses.\n\n Half the patients (12) died between ICU day 1 and day 18, including 4 patients who had a do-not-resuscitate order on admission.\n\n Of the 12 surviving patients, 5 were discharged home, 4 were discharged from the ICU but remained in the hospital, and 3 continued to receive mechanical ventilation in the ICU.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 3 weeks of the Covid-19 outbreak in the Seattle area, the most common reasons for admission to the ICU were hypoxemic respiratory failure leading to mechanical ventilation, hypotension requiring vasopressor treatment, or both.\n\n Mortality among these critically ill patients was high.\n\n (Funded by the National Institutes of Health.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7143164","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical Society","authors":[{"firstname":"Pavan K.","surname":"Bhatraju","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bijan J.","surname":"Ghassemieh","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Michelle","surname":"Nichols","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Richard","surname":"Kim","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Keith R.","surname":"Jerome","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Arun K.","surname":"Nalla","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alexander L.","surname":"Greninger","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sudhakar","surname":"Pipavath","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mark M.","surname":"Wurfel","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Laura","surname":"Evans","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Patricia A.","surname":"Kritek","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"T.

The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and

Design for Mendelian Randomization Studies: Subsample and 2-Sample Instrumental Variable Estimators","abstract":"Mendelian randomization (MR) is a method for estimating the causal relationship between an exposure and an outcome using a genetic factor as an instrumental variable (IV) for the exposure.\n In the traditional MR setting, data on the IV, exposure, and outcome are available for all participants.\n However, obtaining complete exposure data may be difficult in some settings, due to high measurement costs or lack of appropriate biospecimens.\n We used simulated data sets to assess statistical power and bias for MR when exposure data are available for a subset (or an independent set) of participants.\n We show that obtaining exposure data for a subset of participants is a cost-efficient strategy, often having negligible effects on power in comparison with a traditional complete-data analysis.\n The size of the subset needed to achieve maximum power depends on IV strength, and maximum power is approximately equal to the power of traditional IV estimators.\n Weak IVs are shown to lead to bias towards the null when the subsample is small and towards the confounded association when the subset is relatively large.\n Various approaches for confidence interval calculation are considered.\n These results have important implications for reducing the costs and increasing the feasibility of MR studies.\n","id":"PMC3783091","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Oxford University Press","authors":[{"firstname":"Brandon

genetic association analysis identifies 50 new risk loci for gastro-oesophageal reflux, seven new loci for Barrett’s oesophagus and provides insights into clinical heterogeneity in reflux diagnosis","abstract":"Objective\nGastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) has heterogeneous aetiology primarily attributable to its symptom-based definitions.\n\n GERD genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have shown strong genetic overlaps with established risk factors such as obesity and depression.\n\n We hypothesised that the shared genetic architecture between GERD and these risk factors can be leveraged to (1) identify new GERD and Barrett’s oesophagus (BE) risk loci and (2) explore potentially heterogeneous pathways leading to GERD and oesophageal complications.\n\n\nDesign\nWe applied multitrait GWAS models combining GERD (78?707 cases; 288?734 controls) and genetically correlated traits including education attainment, depression and body mass index.\n\n We also used multitrait analysis to identify BE risk loci.\n\n Top hits were replicated in 23andMe (462?753 GERD cases, 24?099 BE cases, 1?484?025 controls).\n\n We additionally dissected the GERD loci into obesity-driven and depression-driven subgroups.\n\n These subgroups were investigated to determine how they relate to tissue-specific gene expression and to risk of serious oesophageal disease (BE and/or oesophageal adenocarcinoma, EA).\n\n\nResults\nWe identified 88 loci associated with GERD, with 59 replicating in 23andMe after multiple testing corrections.\n\n Our BE analysis identified seven novel loci.\n\n Additionally we showed that only the obesity-driven GERD loci (but not the depression-driven loci) were associated with genes enriched in oesophageal tissues and successfully predicted BE/EA.\n\n\nConclusion\nOur multitrait model identified many novel risk loci for GERD and BE.\n\n We present strong evidence for a genetic underpinning of disease heterogeneity in GERD and show that GERD loci associated with depressive symptoms are not strong predictors of BE/EA relative to obesity-driven GERD loci.\n\n\n","id":"PMC9120377","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BMJ Publishing

diseases and is responsible for over 5% of the global disease burden.\n Well-known genetic variants in alcohol metabolizing genes, for example, ALDH2 and ADH1B, are strongly associated with alcohol consumption but have limited impact in European populations where they are found at low frequency.\n We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of self-reported alcohol consumption in 112?117 individuals in the UK Biobank (UKB) sample of white British individuals.\n We report significant genome-wide associations at 14 loci.\n These include single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in alcohol metabolizing genes (ADH1B/ADH1C/ADH5) and two loci in KLB, a gene recently associated with alcohol consumption.\n We also identify SNPs at novel loci including GCKR, CADM2 and FAM69C.\n Gene-based analyses found significant associations with genes implicated in the neurobiology of substance use (DRD2, PDE4B).\n GCTA analyses found a significant SNP-based heritability of self-reported alcohol consumption of 13% (se=0.01).\n Sex-specific analyses found largely overlapping GWAS loci and the genetic correlation (rG) between male and female alcohol consumption was 0.90 (s.\ne.\n=0.09, P-value=7.16 × 10?23).\n Using LD score regression, genetic overlap was found between alcohol consumption and years of schooling (rG=0.18, s.\ne.\n=0.03), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (rG=0.28, s.\ne.\n=0.05), smoking (rG=0.40, s.\ne.\n=0.06) and various anthropometric traits (for example, overweight, rG=?0.19, s.\ne.\n=0.05).\n This study replicates the association between alcohol consumption and alcohol metabolizing genes and KLB, and identifies novel gene associations that should be the focus of future studies investigating the neurobiology of alcohol consumption.\n","id":"PMC5622124","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing

for the initiation of the disease, and so far both genetic factors, such as mutations in telomerase and MUC5B genes as well as environmental components, like cigarette smoking, exposure to asbestos and viral infections have been implicated as potential initiating triggers.\n The injured epithelium then enters a state of senescence-associated secretory phenotype whereby it produces both pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic factors that contribute to the wound healing process in the lung.\n Immune cells, like macrophages and neutrophils as well as activated myofibroblasts then perpetuate this cascade of epithelial cell apoptosis and proliferation by release of pro-fibrotic transforming growth factor beta and continuous deposition of ECM stiffens the basement membrane, altogether having a deleterious impact on epithelial cell function.\n In this review, we describe the role of the epithelium as both a physical and immunological barrier between environment and self in the

as well.\n The possible effects of vitamin D on asthma have led researchers to consider this vitamin a potential prophylactic and therapeutic tool for managing children with variant degrees of asthma.\n Adding vitamin D to the routine corticosteroid therapy of asthmatic children is another field of interest that has shown promising results.\n In this narrative review study, we aim to elaborate on the existing knowledge on the role of vitamin D in asthma pathogenesis and prognosis, explain the controversies that exist on the effectiveness of treating patients with vitamin D supplements, and make a general conclusion about how vitamin D actually is linked to asthma in children.\n","id":"PMC9307373","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Hindawi","authors":[{"firstname":"Fardis","surname":"Salmanpour","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Naghmeh","surname":"Kian","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Naghmeh","surname":"Kian","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Noosha","surname":"Samieefar","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Noosha","surname":"Samieefar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mohammad

analysis","abstract":"Background\nThere is increasing evidence that elevated body mass index (BMI) is associated with reduced survival for women with breast cancer.\n\n However, the underlying reasons remain unclear.\n\n We conducted a Mendelian randomization analysis to investigate a possible causal role of BMI in survival from breast cancer.\n\n\nMethods\nWe used individual-level data from six large breast cancer case-cohorts including a total of 36 210 individuals (2475 events) of European ancestry.\n\n We created a BMI genetic risk score (GRS) based on genotypes at 94 known BMI-associated genetic variants.\n\n Association between the BMI genetic score and breast cancer survival was analysed by Cox regression for each study separately.\n\n Study-specific hazard ratios were pooled using fixed-effect meta-analysis.\n\n\nResults\nBMI genetic score was found to be associated with reduced breast cancer-specific survival for estrogen receptor (ER)-positive cases [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.11, per one-unit increment of GRS, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01–1.22, P = 0.03).\n\n We observed no association for ER-negative cases (HR = 1.00, per one-unit increment of GRS, 95% CI 0.89–1.13, P = 0.95).\n\n\nConclusions\nOur findings suggest a causal effect of increased BMI on reduced breast cancer survival for ER-positive breast cancer.\n\n There is no evidence of a causal effect of higher BMI on survival for ER-negative breast cancer cases.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5837506","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Oxford University

five cases","abstract":"Acute respiratory failure and a systemic coagulopathy are critical aspects of the morbidity and mortality characterizing infection with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome-associated coronavirus-2, the etiologic agent of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n We examined skin and lung tissues from 5 patients with severe COVID-19 characterized by respiratory failure (n= 5) and purpuric skin rash (n?=?3).\n COVID-19 pneumonitis was predominantly a pauci-inflammatory septal capillary injury with significant septal capillary mural and luminal fibrin deposition and permeation of the interalveolar septa by neutrophils.\n No viral cytopathic changes were observed and the diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with hyaline membranes, inflammation, and type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, hallmarks of classic acute respiratory distress syndrome, were not prominent.\n These pulmonary findings were accompanied by significant deposits of terminal complement components C5b-9 (membrane attack complex), C4d, and mannose binding lectin (MBL)-associated serine protease (MASP)2, in the microvasculature, consistent with sustained, systemic activation of the complement pathways.\n The purpuric skin lesions similarly showed a pauci-inflammatory thrombogenic vasculopathy, with deposition of C5b-9 and C4d in both grossly involved and normally-appearing skin.\n In addition, there was co-localization of COVID-19 spike glycoproteins with C4d and C5b-9 in the interalveolar septa and the cutaneous microvasculature of 2 cases examined.\n In conclusion, at least a subset of sustained, severe COVID-19 may define a type of catastrophic microvascular injury syndrome mediated by activation of complement pathways and an associated procoagulant state.\n It provides a foundation for further exploration of the pathophysiologic importance of complement in COVID-19, and could suggest targets for specific

papulosis","abstract":"Background\nDegos disease is a frequently fatal and incurable occlusive vasculopathy most commonly affecting the skin, gastrointestinal tract and brain.\n\n Vascular C5b-9 deposition and a type I interferon (IFN) rich microenvironment are held to be pathogenetically important in the evolution of the vascular changes.\n\n We recently discovered the use of eculizumab as a salvage drug in the treatment of near fatal Malignant atrophic papulosis (MAP).\n\n The effects of eculizumab on the pathology of MAP are explored.\n\n\nMethods\nArchival skin and gastrointestinal biopsy material was procured over a 2.5-year period before and after eculizumab therapy in our index case.\n\n Routine light microscopy and immunohistochemical assessment for C3d, C4d, C5b-9, MxA and caspase 3 were examined.\n\n Direct immunofluorescent studies were also conducted on select biopsy material.\n\n\nResults\nThe patient had received eculizumab as a emergent life saving measure and following rapid improvement he continued with biweekly infusions for 4 years.\n\n Although improved he continues to have signs and symptoms of persistent abdominal disease.\n\n Pre-Eculizumab biopsies showed an active thrombotic microangiopathy associated with a high type I interferon signature and extensive vascular deposits of C5b-9 in skin and gastrointestinal biopsies.\n\n Endothelial cell apoptosis as revealed by Caspase 3 expression was noted.\n\n Inflammation comprising lymphocytes and macrophages along with mesenchymal mucin was observed as well.\n\n Post-eculizumab biopsies did not show active luminal thrombosis but only chronic sequelae of prior episodes of vascular injury.\n\n There was no discernible caspase 3 expression.\n\n After 12 months of therapy, C5b-9 was no longer detectable in tissue.\n\n The high type I IFN signature and inflammation along with mucin deposition was not altered by the drug.\n\n In addition, there was little effect of the drug on the occlusive fibrointimal arteriopathy which appears to be one characterized by extensive myofibroblastic expansion of the intima potentially as revealed by staining for smooth muscle actin without immunoreactivity for desmin and myogenin.\n\n\nConclusions\nComplement activation and enhanced endothelial cell apoptosis play an important role in the thrombotic complications of MAP.\n\n However, the larger vessel proliferative intimal changes appear to be independent of complement activation and may be on the basis of other upstream mechanisms.\n\n Monitoring C5b-9 deposition in tissue is likely not of great value in assessing treatment response to eculizumab given the persistence of C5b-9 in tissue for several months despite clinically effective C5 blocking therapy.\n\n A more integrated approach addressing upstream and downstream pathways in addition to those attributable to complement activation are critical for the successful treatment of MAP.\n\n Eculizumab may be used as salvage therapy in critically ill patients with thrombotic microangiopathy.\n\n \n","id":"PMC3879088","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

In contrast, obesity causes alteration of the constituent immune cells, in which TH1 cells, B cells, neutrophils, or mast cells induce M1 activation of macrophages by the elevated secretion of TNF? and IFN?.\n Increased secretion of TNF? and free fatty acids from hypertrophied adipocytes also contributes to the M1 activation of macrophages.\n Since obesity-induced insulin resistance is established by macrophage infiltration and the activation of immune cells inside tissues, identification of the factors that regulate accumulation and the intracellular signaling cascades that define polarization of M1/M2 would be indispensable.\n Regulation of these factors would lead to the pharmacological inhibition of obesity-induced insulin resistance.\n In this review, we introduce molecular mechanisms relevant to the pathophysiology and review the most recent studies of clinical applications targeting chronic inflammation.\n","id":"PMC3737462","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Frontiers Media S.A.","authors":[{"firstname":"Sanshiro","surname":"Tateya","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Francis","surname":"Kim","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yoshikazu","surname":"Tamori","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Obesity induces a phenotypic switch in adipose tissue macrophage polarization","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.4049/jimmunol.1103426","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Defining GM-CSF- and macrophage-CSF-dependent macrophage responses by in vitro models","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1161/ATVBAHA.108.165100","date":"1970-01-01","title":"T-lymphocyte infiltration in visceral adipose tissue: a primary event in adipose tissue inflammation and the development of obesity-mediated insulin resistance","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.tem.2012.05.011","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Adipose tissue-resident immune cells: key players in immunometabolism","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Adipose expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha: direct role in obesity-linked insulin resistance","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Association between circulating adiponectin and interleukin-10 levels in android obesity: effects of weight loss","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1155/2013/967067","date":"2013-01-09","title":"Serum IL-12 Is Increased in Mexican Obese Subjects and Associated with Low-Grade Inflammation and Obesity-Related Parameters","abstract":"Interleukin-(IL-) 12 has been recently suggested to participate during development of insulin resistance in obese mice.\n Nevertheless, serum IL-12 levels have not been accurately determined in overweight and obese humans.\n We thus studied serum concentrations of IL-12 in Mexican adult individuals, examining their relationship with low-grade inflammation and obesity-related parameters.\n A total of 147 healthy individuals, 43 normal weight, 61 overweight, and 43 obese subjects participated in the study.\n Circulating levels of IL-12, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-?), leptin, insulin, glucose, total cholesterol, and triglyceride were measured after overnight fasting in all of the study subjects.\n Waist circumference and body fat percentage were recorded for all the participants.\n Serum IL-12 was significantly higher in overweight and obese individuals than in normal weight controls.\n Besides being strongly related with body mass index (r = 0.5154), serum IL-12 exhibited a significant relationship with abdominal obesity (r = 0.4481), body fat percentage (r = 0.5625), serum glucose (r = 0.3158), triglyceride (r = 0.3714), and TNF-?

socioeconomic issue all over the world, affecting more than 300 million individuals.\n The disease is considered as an inflammatory disease in the airway, leading to airway hyperresponsiveness, obstruction, mucus hyper-production and airway wall remodeling.\n The presence of airway inflammation in asthmatic patients has been found in the nineteenth century.\n As the information in patients with asthma increase, paradigm change in immunology and molecular biology have resulted in an extensive evaluation of inflammatory cells and mediators involved in the pathophysiology of asthma.\n Moreover, it is recognized that airway remodeling into detail, characterized by thickening of the airway wall, can be profound consequences on the mechanics of airway narrowing and contribute to the chronic progression of the disease.\n Epithelial to mesenchymal transition plays an important role in airway remodeling.\n These epithelial and mesenchymal cells cause persistence of the inflammatory infiltration and induce histological changes in the airway wall, increasing thickness of the basement membrane, collagen deposition and smooth muscle hypertrophy and hyperplasia.\n Resulting of airway inflammation, airway remodeling leads to the airway wall thickening and induces increased airway smooth muscle mass, which generate asthmatic symptoms.\n Asthma is classically recognized as the typical Th2 disease, with increased IgE levels and eosinophilic inflammation in the airway.\n Emerging Th2 cytokines modulates the airway inflammation, which induces airway remodeling.\n Biological agents, which have specific molecular targets for these Th2 cytokines, are available and clinical trials for asthma are ongoing.\n However, the relatively simple paradigm has been doubted because of the realization that strategies designed to suppress Th2 function are not effective enough for all patients in the clinical trials.\n In the future, it is required to understand more details for

contribution of immune cell-derived factors to inflammatory, fibrotic and metabolic alterations in adipose tissue is not well established in human obesity.\n Human primary adipose tissue cells,

adipocyte function, inducing inflammatory responses and decreasing insulin sensitivity.\n Identification of the major factors that mediate detrimental effects of macrophages on adipocytes may offer potential therapeutic targets.\n IL-1?, a proinflammatory cytokine, is suggested to be involved in the development of insulin resistance.\n This study investigated the role of IL-1? in macrophage-adipocyte cross-talk, which affects insulin signaling in human adipocytes.\n Using macrophage-conditioned (MC) medium and human primary adipocytes, we examined the effect of IL-1? antagonism on the insulin signaling pathway.\n Gene expression profile and protein abundance of insulin signaling molecules were determined, as was the production of proinflammatory cytokine/chemokines.\n We also examined whether IL-1? mediates MC medium-induced alteration in adipocyte lipid storage.\n MC medium and IL-1? significantly reduced gene expression and protein abundance of insulin signaling molecules, including insulin receptor substrate-1, phosphoinositide 3-kinase p85?, and glucose transporter 4 and phosphorylation of Akt.\n In contrast, the expression and release of the proinflammatory markers, including IL-6, IL-8, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5 by adipocytes were markedly increased.\n These changes were significantly reduced by blocking IL-1? activity, its receptor binding, or its production by macrophages.\n MC medium-inhibited expression of the adipogenic factors and -stimulated lipolysis was also blunted with IL-1? neutralization.\n We conclude that IL-1? mediates, at least in part, the effect of macrophages on insulin signaling and proinflammatory response in human adipocytes.\n Blocking IL-1? could be beneficial for preventing obesity-associated insulin resistance and inflammation in human adipose tissue.\n","id":"PMC4121578","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"American

diet-induced insulin resistance (IR); however, the contribution of interleukin-1 receptor I (IL-1RI)-mediated signals to this phenotype has not been defined.\n\n We hypothesized that lack of IL-1RI

originating from subjects with wide range of body mass index and from paired biopsies of Sc and omental (Om) AT from obese subjects, was studied by gene expression analysis in the native and activated states.\n\n The paracrine effects of ScATM on the phenotype of human ScAT progenitor cells (CD34+CD31?) were investigated.\n\n\nResults\nTwo main ATM phenotypes were distinguished based on gene expression profiles.\n\n For ScAT-derived ATM, obesity and adipocyte-derived factors favored a pro-fibrotic/remodeling phenotype whereas the OmAT location and hypoxic culture conditions favored a pro-angiogenic phenotype.\n\n Treatment of native human ScAT progenitor cells with ScATM-conditioned media induced the appearance of myofibroblast-like cells as shown by expression of both ?-SMA and the transcription factor SNAIL, an effect mimicked by TGF?1 and activinA.\n\n Immunohistochemical analyses showed the presence of double positive ?-SMA and CD34 cells in the stroma of human ScAT.\n\n

Black race was not associated with higher in-hospital mortality than white race, after adjustment for differences in sociodemographic and clinical characteristics on admission.\nSurveillance of the clinical characteristics and outcomes of hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is imperative for elucidating the epidemiology of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the United States. As of May 13, 2020, the United States had 1,364,061 reported cases with 82,246 deaths. The epidemiologic characteristics are not yet fully known; however, early studies conducted in China and Italy have described a full spectrum of illnesses, ranging from mild to severe, with adults 65 years of age or older and people of all ages with chronic conditions having the highest risk of severe disease, including death. Preliminary U.S. data suggested that persons with diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or chronic lung disease are at higher risk for severe Covid-19-associated disease. The cumulative incidence of Covid-19 ranged widely across the United States, with eight jurisdictions reporting the highest rates (New York, New Jersey, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Michigan, the District of Columbia, and Rhode Island). Case doubling times in these same jurisdictions have exceeded the nationwide average, and these jurisdictions have had some of the highest mortality rates.\nAt the time of this report, Louisiana had 32,662 reported cases and 2315 deaths. Approximately 43% of the cases and 39% of the reported deaths are in the city of New Orleans and surrounding area. Louisiana was one of the first states to publish public health statistics according to race, which showed that black patients represent 59% of all Covid-19-related deaths in the state, even though blacks represent only 33% of the overall population. Although many reports on Covid-19 have highlighted age- and sex-related differences in health outcomes, racial and ethnic differences in outcomes have yet to be described in depth. The objective of this report is to compare the clinical characteristics and hospital course of laboratory-confirmed cases of Covid-19 among black non-Hispanic and white non-Hispanic subpopulations in Louisiana.\nMethods\nStudy Design, Setting, and Population\nThis retrospective, observational, cohort study included patients seen at an Ochsner Health facility between March 1 and April 11, 2020, who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on qualitative polymerase-chain-reaction assay; in-hospital deaths were assessed through May 7, 2020. Ochsner Health, based in New Orleans, is the largest integrated-delivery health system in Louisiana, with 40 owned, managed, and affiliated hospitals; more than 100 health centers and urgent care centers; approximately 25,000 employees; and more than 1300 employed physicians in more than 90 specialties and subspecialties. Ochsner Health facilities are geographically dispersed across the southeastern, western, and northern portions of the state. Among the 522,679 established patients who received care within the past 12 months (e.g., not new to Ochsner Health), 65% identified themselves as white non-Hispanic and 31% as black non-Hispanic. The institutional review board of Ochsner Health approved this study.\nData Collection\nClinical data were extracted from the health system's electronic medical record system, Epic, with the use of an enterprise data warehouse. The data extraction included the following: demographic characteristics (age, sex, patient-reported race and ethnic group, and insurance plan); chronic conditions documented through diagnosis codes linked to ambulatory primary care and specialty encounters (codes in the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision [ICD-10]: E66, Z72.0, J45, J44, E10, E11, I10, I50, I25, N18, Z94, K70 through K77, C0 through D49, and B20) and body-mass index (BMI, the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) recorded within the previous 12 months; selected outpatient medications (immunosuppressants, glucocorticoids, chemotherapy, and immune modulators); symptoms and diagnosis codes linked to primary care, emergency department (ED), or urgent care encounter during which Covid-19 testing occurred; and vital signs, medications, and laboratory or procedure codes and diagnoses (J10 through J18, N17, K72, I42, J96, J80, E11.10, and E87.2) linked to inpatient encounters. ZIP Codes were used to determine whether patients lived in areas where the percentage of low-income residents exceeds the Louisiana benchmark of 39.5%, as defined by the Uniform Data System Mapper.\nStatistical Analysis\nWe compared characteristics of Covid-19-positive patients according to race (black non-Hispanic vs. white non-Hispanic). Patient characteristics are summarized in Table 1 (3481 patients). Covid-19-positive patients who identified themselves as Asian, American Indian or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, or Hispanic or who did not have a recorded race or ethnic group were excluded from the analysis. Clinical characteristics and outcomes (including length of hospital stay, death from any cause, and survival to discharge) are presented for hospitalized patients in Table 2 (1382 patients). Some laboratory studies were performed only in a subgroup of patients; where applicable, the relevant denominators are shown. Calculations for length of hospital stay were restricted to patients for whom the full length of stay could be determined (e.g., those who survived to discharge or died). Categorical measures are presented as percentages. Continuous measures are presented as means and standard deviations or medians and interquartile ranges.\nOutcomes were assessed with unadjusted and multivariable models. Factors that are associated with hospitalization were examined with the use of multivariable logistic regression. Factors that are associated with in-hospital death were investigated with the use of Cox proportional-hazards models. Each outcome (hospitalization and in-hospital death) was assessed with three models: model 1 included race only, model 2 included race with additional covariates of age and sex, and model 3 included race with additional covariates of age, sex, Charlson Comorbidity Index score (with higher scores indicating a greater burden of illness), residence in a low-income area (yes vs. no), and obesity (yes vs. no). In addition, insurance was included in model 3 for hospitalization. A fourth model for in-hospital death included baseline vital signs and laboratory measures (detailed below). All model covariates were selected a priori on the basis of clinical relevance or results of bivariate analyses with outcomes. The selected covariates have been studied previously and shown to be associated with clinical outcomes or health care use. Select interactions with race were investigated, but associations were negligible.\nFor variables for which less than 25% of the data was missing, values were imputed with the use of multiple imputation by fully conditional specification. The multiple-imputation models incorporated all available baseline data, and 50 imputations were carried out. BMI was imputed for 683 Covid-19-positive patients. Baseline laboratory measures for venous lactate level (268 patients), C-reactive protein level (287), procalcitonin level (305), and lymphocyte count (32) were imputed among hospitalized patients. Results from the analysis of hospitalization are presented in Table 3 as odds ratios. Results from the analyses of in-hospital death are presented in Table 4 as hazard ratios.\nThe models for in-hospital death all considered time to death, with data from patients discharged alive or still admitted treated as censored observations. Before the construction of the multivariable models for in-hospital death, baseline laboratory measures and vital signs were compared between outcome groups (dead vs. alive) through standardized differences (Tables S1 and S2 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). Oxygen saturation was not included in the model because of a moderate correlation with respiratory rate as well as a recent meta-analysis that indicated that dyspnea is a strong prognostic indicator of Covid-19 progression. Levels of troponin I, brain-type natriuretic peptide, and ferritin were not considered because these are not standard laboratory measures at admission that are relevant to all patients. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was not considered because of a high correlation with aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Variables with standardized differences greater than 0.1 between outcome groups were then incorporated into the final analysis (model 4).\nAfter balance diagnostics were performed, the final Cox proportional-hazards model incorporated race, age, sex, Charlson Comorbidity Index score, residence in a low-income area (yes vs. no), insurance, obesity (yes vs. no), respiratory rate, AST level, venous lactate level, platelet count, creatinine level, bilirubin level, procalcitonin level, C-reactive protein level, and lymphocyte count. The proportional-hazards assumption for the Cox models was investigated and confirmed graphically through survival functions over time. All model-based results are presented with 95% confidence intervals. All analyses were conducted with the use of the SAS System for Windows, version 9.4 (SAS Institute).\nResults\nCharacteristics of Covid-19-Positive Patients\nA total of 3626 patients tested positive, of whom 145 were excluded (84 had missing data on race or ethnic group, 9 were Hispanic, 43 were Asian, 6 were American Indian or Alaska Native, and 3 were Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander). Among the 3481 patients included in the analysis, the mean age was 54 years, most were female (60.0%), and 70.4% were black non-Hispanic (Table 1). The percentage of black patients with Medicaid insurance was three times as high as the percentage of white non-Hispanic patients, and black patients were almost twice as likely to live in low-income areas as white patients. Black patients had higher prevalences of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease than white patients. Black patients were also more likely than white patients to present with fever, cough, or dyspnea at the time of Covid-19 testing. Most patients were tested for Covid-19 in the ED (1992 patients, 57.2%), with a higher percentage of black patients having been tested in the ED than white patients (65.3% vs. 38.0%).\nCharacteristics and Outcomes of Hospitalized Patients\nA total of 39.7% of the patients who tested positive for Covid-19 were hospitalized. Among the 1992 patients tested for Covid-19 in the ED, 40.3% of black patients (646 of 1601 patients) and 44.2% of white patients (173 of 391 patients) were admitted to the hospital on the same day they were tested. Overall, black patients composed 76.9% of the hospital admissions (Table 2). A higher percentage of black patients than white patients were febrile on admission. A higher percentage of white patients than black patients presented with low white-cell, lymphocyte, or platelet counts; low sodium levels; or elevated levels of brain-type natriuretic peptide. However, a higher percentage of black patients than white patients presented with elevated levels of creatinine, AST, procalcitonin, and C-reactive protein. The most common acute medical conditions observed among all patients at any time during hospitalization were hypoxic respiratory failure and pneumonia coinfection (defined as a Covid-19-positive test and viral or bacterial pneumonia). A higher percentage of black patients than white patients had acute renal failure during hospitalization (15.3% vs. 10.7%). More than one third of admitted patients (474 patients) received care in an intensive care unit, among whom 80.2% were black patients. Among the 364 patients receiving mechanical ventilation, 81.6% were black.\nOf the 326 patients who died in the hospital, 230 (70.6%) were black. Among deceased patients, a higher percentage of black patients than white patients had been treated with mechanical ventilation (73.9% vs. 36.5%). The unadjusted case-fatality rate for white patients was 30.1%, as compared with 21.6% among black patients. The median length of hospital stay was similar across racial groups. Additional descriptions of the clinical course of care for patients who received critical care services are provided in Tables S3 and S4.\nFactors Associated with Hospitalization\nTable 3 shows the unadjusted and adjusted odds of hospital admission. In the adjusted analysis (model 3), black race was associated with approximately twice the odds of hospital admission as white race (odds ratio, 1.96; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.62 to 2.37). In addition, increasing age, a higher score on the Charlson Comorbidity Index, public insurance (Medicare or Medicaid), residence in a low-income area, and obesity were associated with an increased odds of admission, whereas female sex was associated with lower odds of admission.\nFactors Associated with In-Hospital Death\nTable 4 shows the Cox proportional-hazards models for factors associated with in-hospital death. In the adjusted time-to-event analyses (model 4), variables that were associated with higher in-hospital mortality were increasing age and presentation with an elevated respiratory rate; elevated levels of venous lactate, creatinine, or procalcitonin; or low platelet or lymphocyte counts. However, black race was not independently associated with risk of in-hospital death (hazard ratio, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.68 to 1.17).\nDiscussion\nThis study examined the characteristics and clinical outcomes of a large cohort of Covid-19-positive patients in Louisiana. Blacks and female patients represented the majority of all Covid-19-positive patients. Black patients had higher prevalences of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease at baseline than white patients. Although black patients represent 31% of the patients routinely cared for by Ochsner Health, they made up 76.9% of Covid-19-positive patients hospitalized within the health system. A higher percentage of blacks than whites presented with elevated levels of creatinine, AST, or inflammatory markers. Among the patients who received critical care or mechanical ventilation, approximately 80% were black. Black race, increasing age, a higher score on the Charlson Comorbidity Index, public insurance (Medicare or Medicaid), residence in a low-income area, and obesity were associated with increased odds of hospital admission. Blacks were overrepresented among all patients who died in the hospital (70.6%). However, black race was not associated with higher in-hospital mortality than white race, after adjustment for differences in sociodemographic and clinical characteristics on admission; this finding is similar to that of a recent study in the state of Georgia in which 80% of hospitalized patients with Covid-19 were black.\nThe racial differences in the frequency of Covid-19 observed in the study population are probably multifactorial. They may reflect underlying racial differences in the types of jobs that may have an increased risk of community exposure (e.g., service occupations). In a 2015 report on the civilian labor force in Louisiana, most service workers in New Orleans and surrounding areas were members of minority groups. Approximately 40% of service occupations in New Orleans were jobs related to food preparation and serving. Racial differences in Covid-19 that were observed may also reflect differences in the prevalence of chronic conditions that appear to increase the risk of severe illness. According to a 2018 Health Report Card, Louisiana ranked 45th of 50 states for obesity, 46th for heart disease or strokes, and 47th for diabetes. The report further showed that the incidences of obesity and diabetes were higher in the black population than in the white population. The incidences of these conditions are also higher among persons with lower education and low-income levels across all race groups.\nThis study confirms previously described clinical presentations, laboratory findings, and outcomes of Covid-19-related hospital admissions but also highlights racial differences. Hypoxic respiratory failure and pneumonia coinfection were the most common acute medical conditions during hospitalization (25.3% and 37.8%, respectively, of all patients). Frequent laboratory abnormalities included leukopenia and thrombocytopenia with elevated levels of creatinine, aminotransferases, and markers of inflammation. Unlike in previous studies, we observed racial differences in several laboratory results. This difference in clinical presentation may reflect a longer wait to access care among black patients, resulting in more severe illness on presentation to health care facilities. It is notable that similar percentages of black patients and white patients presented with severe illness requiring hospitalization on the same day that the disease was diagnosed (40.3% and 44.2% respectively). However, for the remaining patients who had tested positive as outpatients and were subsequently admitted, the type and frequency of interim care received in the ambulatory setting and whether there were racial differences in the receipt of care remain unclear.\nThe observed differences in clinical presentation may also reflect differences in underlying chronic conditions on hospital presentation. For example, chronic renal insufficiency at baseline and acute renal failure during hospitalization were more common among black patients than white patients. Black patients were more likely to have fever on testing or elevated levels of procalcitonin, or C-reactive protein. These findings may suggest a different immune response to Covid-19 according to race. In a study examining population differences in the immune response to pathogens, Nedelec et al. found that African ancestry was associated with a stronger inflammatory response to pathogens than European ancestry. Our findings suggest that more studies are warranted to assess the immune response to this novel coronavirus with regard to racial and ethnic differences, other factors that may influence the difference in hospitalizations, and the effect on outcomes.\nThis study also showed associations between the risk of in-hospital death and demographic factors (age) and clinical factors (respiratory rate) as well as several biomarkers (levels of venous lactate, creatinine, procalcitonin and platelet count), findings similar to those of other studies. For example, in a meta-analysis of 13 studies (involving 3027 Covid-19-positive patients), Zheng et al. reported that fever and dyspnea were associated with progression of disease. In a meta-analysis of 21 studies (involving 3377 patients and 33 laboratory variables), Henry et al. reported that biomarkers of cardiac injury, liver and kidney function, and inflammation and coagulation measures were significantly elevated in patients with severe and fatal Covid-19. It remains unclear whether the direction and strength of the associations between these biomarkers and in-hospital death differ in their prognostic implications across different populations. Further research on predictive modeling of in-hospital death is needed to better inform management of the care of inpatients with Covid-19.\nThis study has several limitations. The study analysis was limited to one integrated-delivery health system in Louisiana and therefore may have limited external generalizability to other health care settings. However, the strength of this study is the addition of Covid-19 epidemiologic data based on a large population of black non-Hispanic patients in the southern region of the United States. Patients with chronic lung disease and conditions that are associated with immunosuppression and related therapy were only a small percentage of the population tested. We cannot draw any conclusions regarding those subpopulations. Not all laboratory studies were performed in all patients. Therefore, their roles in the clinical presentation of the study population may not be sufficiently represented. Nonetheless, variation in laboratory testing probably reflects rapid changes in clinical management of Covid-19 as the public health crisis unfolded globally. Finally, this study relied solely on structured data captured in the electronic medical record. Study findings are therefore subject to the accuracy and completeness of electronic documentation by the care team.\nNotwithstanding these limitations, this study provides comparative epidemiologic characteristics of black non-Hispanic patients who are underrepresented in the Covid-19 medical literature to date. The study also sheds light on differences in clinical presentations.\nIn-kind support was provided by the Ochsner Health Center for Outcomes and Health Services Research.\nDisclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.\nThis article was published on May 27, 2020, at NEJM.org.\nSupplementary Appendix\nDisclosure Forms\nReferences\nCOVID-19: cases in the US.

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020.

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.\n\n Increasing quartile of NLR was statistically significantly associated with secondary outcome.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR is associated with outcomes in unselected critically ill patients.\n\n In patients with sepsis, there was no statistically significant relationship between NLR and mortality.\n\n Further investigation is required to increase understanding of the

recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like

municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found

suggests that rapid activation of social distancing can arrest epidemic development due to a novel strain of influenza","abstract":"Background\nSocial distancing interventions such as school closure and prohibition of public gatherings are present in pandemic influenza preparedness plans.\n\n Predicting the effectiveness of intervention strategies in a pandemic is difficult.\n\n In the absence of other evidence, computer simulation can be used to help policy makers plan for a potential future influenza pandemic.\n\n We conducted simulations of a small community to determine the magnitude and timing of activation that would be necessary for social distancing interventions to arrest a future pandemic.\n\n\nMethods\nWe used a detailed, individual-based model of a real community with a population of approximately 30,000. We simulated the effect of four social distancing interventions: school closure, increased isolation of symptomatic individuals in their household, workplace nonattendance, and reduction of contact in the wider community.\n\n We simulated each of the intervention measures in isolation and in several combinations; and examined the effect of delays in the activation of interventions on the final and daily attack rates.\n\n\nResults\nFor an epidemic with an R0 value of 1.5, a combination of all four social distancing measures could reduce the final attack rate from 33% to below 10% if introduced within 6 weeks from the introduction of the first case.\n\n In contrast, for an R0 of 2.5 these measures must be introduced within 2 weeks of the first case to achieve a similar reduction; delays of 2, 3 and 4 weeks resulted in final attack rates of 7%, 21% and 45% respectively.\n\n For an R0 of 3.5 the combination of all four measures could reduce the final attack rate from 73% to 16%, but only if introduced without delay; delays of 1, 2 or 3 weeks resulted in final attack rates of 19%, 35% or 63% respectively.\n\n For the higher R0 values no single measure has a significant impact on attack rates.\n\n\nConclusion\nOur results suggest a critical role of social distancing in the potential control of a future pandemic and indicate that such interventions are capable of arresting influenza epidemic development, but only if they are used in combination, activated without delay and maintained for a relatively long period.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2680828","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Joel K","surname":"Kelso","email":"joel@csse.uwa.edu.au","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"George J","surname":"Milne","email":"milne@csse.uwa.edu.au","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Heath","surname":"Kelly","email":"Heath.Kelly@mh.org.au","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1126/science.abb6105","date":"2020-03-27","title":"An investigation of transmission control measures during the first 50 days of the COVID-19 epidemic in China","abstract":"By 23 February 2020, China had imposed a national emergency response to restrict travel and impose social distancing measures on its populace in an attempt to inhibit the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome–coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).\n However, which measures were most effective is uncertain.\n Tian et al.\n performed a quantitative analysis of the impact of control measures between 31 December 2019 and 19 February 2020, which encompasses the Lunar New Year period when millions of people traveled across China for family visits.\n Travel restrictions in and out of Wuhan were too late to prevent the spread of the virus to 262 cities within 28 days.\n However, the epidemic peaked in Hubei province on 4 February 2020, indicating that measures such as closing citywide public transport and entertainment venues and banning public gatherings combined to avert hundreds of thousands of cases of infection.\n It is unlikely that this decline happened because the supply of susceptible people was exhausted, so relaxing control measures could lead to a resurgence.\n","id":"PMC7164389","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"American Association for the Advancement of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Huaiyu","surname":"Tian","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yonghong","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yidan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chieh-Hsi","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Chieh-Hsi","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Moritz U.

pulmonary embolism: a propensity score matching analysis","abstract":"id='Par1'>Older patients, especially those with malignancy, may have an increased risk of pulmonary embolism (PE).\n However, few studies have evaluated the clinical characteristics and prognosis of older patients.\n We evaluated the clinical characteristics, prognosis, and risk factors in older patients with lung cancer complicated with PE.\n This was a single-center, prospective cohort study.\n Older patients (?65 years) with lung cancer admitted in Beijing Hospital from January 2006 to December 2016 were enrolled.\n The patients were divided into two groups according to the presence of PE using propensity score matching (PSM).\n After PSM, one hundred and six patients (53 per group) with an average age of (77.3?±?10.9) years were enrolled.\n Adenocarcinoma was the most common histology in patients with PE (52.8%, n?=?28), and most lung cancer patients were in stages III and IV (59.4%, n?=?63).\n Patients with PE were stratified to low risk (52.8%, n?=?28), intermediate-low risk (24.5%, n?=?13), intermediate-high risk (15.1%, n?=?8), high-risk (7.5%, n?=?4) subgroups.\n Most PE patients presented with dyspnea (75.5%), and the majority of patients (86.8%, n?=?46) developed PE within 3 months after the diagnosis of cancer.\n The median follow-up time was 23.7 months (12.0–62.0 months), and 7 patients (6.6%) were lost to follow-up.\n During the follow-up period, 92 patients (86.8%) died, including 8 cases (8.7%) of PE-related death, 73 (79.3%) of tumor death, and 11 (11.9%) of unknown cause.\n There were significant differences in all-cause mortality (94.3% vs.\n 83.0%) and PE-related mortality (15.1% vs.\n 0) between the PE and control groups, but the rate of tumor-related mortality (75.5% vs.\n 66.0%) was comparable between the groups.\n Among the 92 patients who died, the mortality rates at 3, 6, 12, and?&gt;?12 months after tumor diagnosis were 33.0% (33/106), 57.5% (61/106), 78.3% (83/106), and 89.6% (95/106), respectively.\n Kaplan–Meier survival analysis showed that the median overall survival time was significantly different between the PE and the control groups (4.3 vs.\n 9.2 months, P?=?0.0015).\n Multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis showed that age???77 years (OR?=?2.58, 95%CI: 1.66–4.01), clinical stage III–IV (OR?=?2.21, 95%CI: 1.03–4.74), adenocarcinoma (OR?=?3.24, 95%CI: 1.75–6.00), high D-dimer (?600?mg/L) (OR?=?2.73, 95%CI: 1.25–5.96), and low partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2; &lt;75?mmHg) (OR?=?2.85, 95%CI: 1.74–4.67)

between clinicopathological characteristics of lung adenocarcinoma and the risk of venous thromboembolism","abstract":"Background\nPatients with primary lung adenocarcinoma are at increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE).\n\n However, lung adenocarcinoma characteristics differ across histological subtypes.\n\n Therefore, we performed comprehensive analyses on the clinicopathological characteristics of lung adenocarcinoma and risk of VTE.\n\n\nMethods\nA total of 952 surgically resected lung adenocarcinoma cases were reviewed and classified according to criteria of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC)/American Thoracic Society (ATS) /European Respiratory Society (ERS).\n\n The correlation between this classification and VTE risk was retrospectively analyzed.\n\n The risks of other clinicopathological features including pleural invasion, vascular invasion and associated surgical intervention risks were also assessed.\n\n\nResults\nOf the 952 patients, 100 (10.4%) cases experienced VTE events during the follow?up period.\n\n Among those with VTE, 28 (28%) were found before surgery, 47 (47%) were found within 1?month after surgery, and 91 (91%) were found in hospital.\n\n Univariate analysis revealed that ages, extent of resection and presence of micropapillary features were predictive of VTE risk.\n\n Furthermore, multivariable analysis demonstrated that the presence of micropapillary features (subdistribution hazard ratio [SHR] 1.560, 95% CI: 1.043–2.330) and age?&gt;60 (SHR: 2.270, 95%

Chemotherapy Is a Strong Risk Factor for Thromboembolic Events in Small-Cell Lung Cancer","abstract":"Purpose\nCisplatin-associated arterial and venous thromboembolic events (TEEs) are becoming an increasing concern.\n\n In patients with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) who are treated using cisplatin-based chemotherapy, we assume that the overall risk of TEEs is high.\n\n However, cisplatin-associated vascular toxicity in patients with SCLC has been overlooked to date.\n\n The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of TEEs in patients with SCLC and to analyze the predictors for TEE occurrence.\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\nWe retrospectively analyzed 277 patients who received chemotherapy for SCLC between 2006 and 2012. As the influence of chemotherapy on TEE occurrence developed after its initiation, a time-dependent Cox regression analysis was used to estimate the significant predictors for TEE.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the 277 patients, 30 patients (11%) developed a TEE.\n\n The 3-month, 6-month, and 1-year cumulative incidences of TEEs were 5.0%, 9.1%, and 10.2%, respectively.\n\n Of 30 total TEEs, 22 (73%) occurred between the time of initiation and 4 weeks after the last dose of platinum-based chemotherapy.\n\n Approximately 218 patients (79%) received cisplatin-based chemotherapy.\n\n In multivariate analysis, cisplatin-based chemotherapy was an independent risk factor for TEE occurrence (hazard ratio [HR], 4.36; p=0.05).\n\n Variables including smoking status (common HR, 2.14; p=0.01) and comorbidity index (common HR, 1.60; p=0.05) also showed significant association with TEE occurrence.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe 1-year cumulative incidence of TEE is 10.2% in Asian patients with SCLC.\n\n Cisplatin-based chemotherapy in SCLC might be a strong predictor for the risk of TEE.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4614217","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Korean Cancer

The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on

In conclusion, cardiac injury was common in patients admitted with COVID-19. The extent of cardiac injury and peak hs-cTnI concentrations were associated with worse outcomes.\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in a global pandemic affecting more than 10 million people worldwide and more than 2.5 million in the United States. Although the reported case-fatality rates have been variable, in-hospital mortality has been reported to be as high as 21%. Several risk factors have been reported to be associated with worse disease and outcomes. Preexisting cardiac comorbid conditions and acute cardiac complications from COVID-19 correlated with more severe disease and higher fatality rates.   Small cohort studies have described the association between cardiovascular disease and cardiac injury with outcomes in patients with COVID-19, but data is still limited. We present the largest comprehensive study looking at myocardial injury and mortality in patients with COVID-19 in the U.S. This study aims to evaluate outcomes of U.S. patients with cardiovascular comorbidities, determine factors associated with cardiac injury, and examine the association of cardiac injury with the severity of illness in patients with COVID-19.\nMethods\nPatients admitted to Henry Ford Health System, a tertiary care center in Southeast Michigan, USA, between March 9 and April 15, 2020, was included in the study. Patients selected were &gt;=18 years of age, diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2, and hospitalized. Patients were excluded if high-sensitivity troponin (hs-cTnI) levels were not obtained, they were transferred to or out of our center, or developed cardiac arrest before presentation. Records were retrospectively reviewed. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB# 13774), and informed consent was waived.\nSARS-CoV-2 was diagnosed by onsite molecular diagnostic testing for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using RT-PCR (NeuMoDx assay). This method has been validated against the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reference method to meet or exceed the level of detection required under the Food and Drug Administration and Emergency Use Authorization guidelines.\nThe epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory data were manually extracted from electronic health records. Symptoms were deemed positive if endorsed within 24 hours of presentation. Comorbid conditions were identified based on admission and discharge diagnoses. Baseline levels refer to initial blood samples collected in the emergency department (ED) or the first values within 24 hours of admission. Patients admitted with COVID-19 had hs-cTnI (Beckman-Coulter) and inflammatory markers such as D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin, and C-reactive protein performed in the ED. These laboratory tests were repeated after 48 hours. Serial testing, however, was performed earlier based on an abnormal initial result at the discretion of the responsible provider. Peak concentrations referred to the highest laboratory value before the corresponding outcome. Imaging findings were described in accordance to Radiological Society of North America Expert Consensus Statement on Reporting Chest CT Findings Related to COVID-19. \nCardiac injury was defined as hs-cTnI concentration &gt;18ng/L, which is &gt;99th percentile of the upper limit of normal. Hs-cTnI, D-dimer, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, and C-reactive protein levels were documented at presentation, and then at peak during hospitalization. Acute kidney injury was defined according to the &quot;Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes&quot; criteria for creatinine.

Descriptive statistical analysis was obtained for all included study variables and are summarized in Table 1 . Categorical variables were described by frequency and percentages, and continuous variables were defined by the median and interquartile range. Patient characteristics were compared using analysis of variance or Kruskal Wallis test for continuous variables based on the normality of the data, and chi-square test or Fisher exact tests for categorical variables. Univariate analysis was first performed to identify the significant variables associated with cardiac injury and mortality on admission. Multivariable and multivariate logistic regression analyses were then performed to identify significant predictors of mortality. Candidate variables for model inclusion included clinically relevant variables associated with COVID-19 mortality   and those with a p-value &lt;=0.05 on univariable analysis, with model exit criteria p-value &gt;=0.1. Time-to-event analysis was done using Kaplan-Meier curves for patients with and without cardiac injury stratified by initial hs-cTnI levels, first abnormal hs-cTnI, and maximum hs-cTnI levels. Post-hoc testing was done and a Benjami-Hochberg adjustment was applied to control for type 1 error. Log-rank test was used to identify any difference between the 3 groups of interest. Statistical analyses were considered significant if p &lt;= 0.05.\nResults\nOne thousand and forty-four patients met the initial inclusion criteria. Four patients who developed cardiac arrest or intubation before presentation or were transferred to and out of our center were excluded. Twenty patients without hs-cTnI levels were also excluded. A total of 1,020 patients were included in the final analysis. Baseline characteristics included a median age of 63 (52-73) years, body mass index (BMI) of 31 (20-42) kg/m2, 511 (50%) were female, and 403 (40%) were Caucasian. Additional characteristics are detailed in Table 1.\nOf those included in the final analysis, 390 (38%) demonstrated cardiac injury on presentation to the ED. In these patients, the median age was 70 (51-89) years, BMI 30 (19-41) kg/m2, 161 (41%) were female, and 152 (39%) were white. Patients with cardiac injury were noted to have a higher burden of cardiac risk factors including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation/flutter, and cerebrovascular disease. Patients in this group were more likely to be smokers or have a history of pulmonary or kidney disease (Table 1). Baseline laboratory data, including inflammatory markers, were compared between both groups. Patients with cardiac injury had higher median levels of lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, ferritin, and D-dimer. There were no significant differences on chest X-ray or CT chest imaging findings (Table 1).\nIn-hospital outcomes categorized according to presenting levels of high sensitivity\nTable 2	 	\nVariable	Presenting high sensitivity troponin levels (ng/L)	p-value	 	Undetectable &lt;2.3 (n = 80)	2.3-18 (n = 550)	&gt;18-99 (n = 303)	&gt;= 100 (n = 87)	 	Hs-cTnI level (ng/L)	2.3 (2.3-2.3)	9 (5-16)	35 (25-51)	186 (129-334)	&lt;0.001	 	Acute kidney injury	21 (26%)	157 (29%)	175 (58%)	49 (56%)	&lt;0.001	 	Renal replacement therapy	2 (3%)	8 (2%)	18 (6%)	8 (9%)	&lt;0.001	 	Intensive care unit transfer	9 (11%)	84 (16%)	76 (25%)	29 (34%)	&lt;0.001	 	ARDS	7 (9%)	54 (10%)	62 (21%)	31 (36%)	&lt;0.001	 	 Mild	1 (1%)	8 (2%)	10 (3%)	6 (7%)	&lt;0.001	 	 Moderate	2 (3%)	25 (5%)	18 (6%)	10 (12%)	 	 Severe	5 (6%)	23 (4%)	33 (11%)	16 (18%)	 	Mechanical ventilation	10 (13%)	59 (11%)	68 (22%)	32 (37%)	&lt;0.001	 	Mortality	7 (9%)	45 (8%)	84 (28%)	44 (51%)	&lt;0.001	 	Mechanical ventilation, and death	12 (15%)	110 (20%)	122 (40%)	57 (66%)	&lt;0.001	 	ICU, mechanical ventilation, and death	12 (15%)	110 (20%)	303 (40%)	87 (66%)	&lt;0.001	 	\nAbbreviations: ARDS = Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome; Hs-cTnI = High Sensitivity Troponin; ICU = Intensive Care Unit.\nUsing presenting hs-cTnI trends, patients with higher levels by categories &lt;=18 ng/L, &gt;18-99 ng/L, and &gt;=100 ng/L were more likely to develop in-hospital complications and adverse events including acute kidney injury, need for renal replacement therapy, mechanical ventilation, ICU transfer, and mortality (Table 2). A nondetectable hs-cTnI on presentation did not rule out significant events (15% risk for the need for mechanical ventilation or death, Table 2).\nPredictors of inpatient mortality after multivariate regression using patient risk factors, inpatient complications as well as peak serum biomarkers levels\nTable 3	 	\nVariables	Odds ratio (95% confidence interval)	p-value	 	Age &gt;= 65 (years)	3.9 (2.2-6.7)	&lt;0.001	 	Atrial fibrillation/flutter	2.5 (1.2-5.3)	0.014	 	Cerebrovascular disease	2.5 (1.3-5.0)	0.008	 	Peak D-dimer &lt; 1 microg/ml	Reference	0.013	 	Peak D-dimer &gt;= 1 &lt; 1.8 microg/ml	1.2 (0.4-3.7)	0.696	 	Peak D-dimer &gt;= 1.8 &lt; 4 microg/ml	2.7 (1.0-7.4)	0.049	 	Peak D-dimer &gt;= 4 microg/ml	3.3 (1.2-9.0)	0.017	 	Peak high sensitivity troponin &lt;= 18 ng/L	Reference	&lt;0.001	 	Peak high sensitivity troponin 19-99 ng/L	3.0 (1.5-6.0)	0.002	 	Peak high sensitivity troponin &gt;=100 ng/L	7.7 (3.7-16.0)	&lt;0.001	 	Acute respiratory distress syndrome	14.6 (8.2-25.7)	&lt;0.001	 	\nVariables controlled for:\nRisk factors: Age &gt;= 65, Gender, Body Mass Index, Hypertension, Coronary Artery Disease, Heart Failure, Atrial Fibrillation/ Flutter, Cerebrovascular Disease, Immunosuppressed State, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Kidney Disease, Cirrhosis. Inpatient Clinical Data Elements: Peak levels of High Sensitivity Troponin, Lactate Dehydrogenase, C-Reactive Protein, Ferritin and D-dimer levels based on quartiles, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Acute Kidney Injury\nMultivariate logistic regression analysis identified the clinical data elements independently predictive of mortality using comorbidities, peak values of laboratory data, and inpatient complications. These independent predictors included age &gt;=65, atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascular disease, D-dimer quartiles, hs-cTnI categories (&lt;=18, &gt;18-99, and &gt;=100 ng/L), and ARDS. Clinical data elements included in the multivariate analysis are detailed in Table 3 .\nSurvival probability of patients according to cardiac injury incidence categories. Kaplan Meier survival curves reveal the survival probability of patients according to cardiac injury incidence categories. Patients with injury on presentation (C), (red) have a lower survival probability than those who develop cardiac injury later in their stay (B), (purple) (adjusted log-rank p=0.012), and both have a lower survival probability than those who never develop cardiac injury (A), (green) (adjusted log-rank p &lt;0.001 and p=0.003, respectively). Cardiac injury was defined by a hs-cTnI concentration &gt;99th percentile.\nFigure 1\nThe Kaplan-Meier curves in Figure 1 demonstrate the survival probability between patient groups according to the incidence of cardiac injury. Patients with injury on presentation have a lower survival probability than those who develop cardiac injury later in their stay (adjusted log-rank p=0.012), and both have a lower survival probability than those who never develop cardiac injury (adjusted log-rank p &lt; 0.001 and p=0.003, respectively) (Figure 1).\nDiscussion\nThis is one of the largest studied cohorts in the U.S. describing cardiac injury and its associated outcomes in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Patients with cardiovascular risk factors (older age, hypertension, diabetes) and cardiovascular disease (coronary artery disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and cerebrovascular disease) were at an increased risk of developing cardiac injury. Subsequently, those with cardiac injury were associated with a higher risk of intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilator support, and mortality. These findings are similar to the reports published in Chinese cohorts.       \nA notable finding was the higher prevalence of cardiac injury on admission in our patients compared to what was reported in China (38% vs 20%).   Our patient cohort also had a higher prevalence of cardiovascular conditions including hypertension (73% vs 31%), diabetes mellitus (44% vs 14%), and cerebrovascular disease (12% vs 5%). These comorbid conditions were associated with cardiac injury (p &lt; 0.05), which likely explains the higher incidence of cardiac injury in our cohort. The higher incidence of cardiac injury may also contribute to the higher mortality rates seen in the U.S. cohort. From the available data, ARDS and cardiac injury are noted to be the strongest predictors of need for mechanical ventilation and mortality in patients with COVID-19. Although data from Wuhan showed cardiac injury on presentation was an independent factor associated with mortality, our current U.S. study did not reproduce similar results. However, our study did show that patients with higher peak hs-cTnI levels during admission had significantly higher rates of mechanical ventilation or death. This suggests that the extent of cardiac injury is associated with outcomes including mortality.\nPotential cardiac injury mechanisms in COVID-19. This figure illustrates the proposed mechanisms of cardiac injury in COVID-19. Systemic infection is likely mediated through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptors found on multiple cell lineages, including the alveolar and cardiac cells. The proposed mechanisms of injury include myopericarditis through direct viral infection or systemic inflammation, hypercoagulability leading to coronary bed microthrombi, vasculitis, stress cardiomyopathy, acute coronary syndrome, and type-II myocardial infarction from supply-demand mismatch.\nFigure 2\nThe exact mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 leads to cardiac injury is not fully elucidated. Figure 2 illustrates the multiple proposed mechanisms. SARS-CoV-2 infection is mediated through the viral surface spike protein to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor. Systemic infection is likely due to entry through pulmonary alveolar ACE-2 receptors, which are also present on the heart, kidneys, vascular endothelium, and others.   During the SARS outbreak, SARS-CoV-1 viral RNA was detected in 35% of hearts on autopsy. In murine models with previous SARS-CoV-1, cardiac viral infection was mediated by an ACE-2-dependent myocardial viral entry; it has been proposed that a similar mechanism of cardiac injury exists where SARS-CoV-2 can directly affect cardiac myocytes, inducing myocarditis or pericarditis as supported by case reports of pericardial effusion and tamponade in patients with COVID-19.   An early controversy in the treatment of COVID-19 was whether the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockers confer a higher risk of mortality in these patients. This theory is based on the speculation that these drugs may upregulate the expression of ACE-2 receptors. This, however, is not the case in published cohorts, including our study. Supply-demand mismatch is another mechanism by which cardiac injury can occur. The severe systemic immune response from infection may lead to increased physiologic stressors resulting in a combination of hypotension, increased metabolic demands, and hypoxia from acute lung injury. This has been historically well described in other disease processes causing sepsis, and commonly leads to type II myocardial infarction. Sepsis, inflammation and ARDS are well-known entities that cause coagulation disorders. Hypercoagulability leading to microthrombi has also been described in patients with COVID-19. In this study, patients with cardiac injury were more likely to have elevated D-dimer levels (1.9 vs 1.1 microg/ml, p &lt; 0.001), raising the possibility of microthrombi formation as another mechanism by which cardiac injury occurs. Additionally, new reports of higher incidence of Kawasaki's disease in Italy after the COVID-19 pandemic surge may suggest vascular involvement, which can affect the coronary vessels. Finally, the development of acute coronary syndrome in the setting of infection and heightened cytokine response is possible. A case series from New York identified patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction in COVID-19 and revealed variability in presentation and presence of obstructive disease, suggesting that myocardial injury could be due to plaque rupture, coronary spasm, or direct endothelial injury. Confirmation of these proposed mechanisms will require future post-mortem analysis.\nThere are multiple strengths and limitations to our study. To date, our study is one of the largest to describe patterns of cardiac injury, particularly from the U.S. The main limitation of this study is the retrospective design. Given the retrospective nature of the analysis and changes in contemporary COVID-19 management, the timing of laboratory blood sampling could not be standardized in all patients. Patients who remain admitted were not included, as our primary outcome could not be assessed. Additionally, hs-cTnI is a biomarker, and categorization of the type of injury and mechanism behind hs-cTnI elevation is not easily determined when performing a retrospective analysis. Larger prospective trials with standardized protocols may better verify these results.\nIn conclusion, the presence of cardiovascular risk factors was associated with an increased risk of developing cardiac injury in patients admitted with COVID-19. The extent of cardiac injury was associated with worse outcomes, including mortality.\nAuthor contributions\nMohamad Raad, MD: Conceptualization, methodology, data curation, data analysis, writing, reviewing and editing of the original and revised drafts.

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

Coronavirus–Infected Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nThe initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7121484","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.\n\n Increasing quartile of NLR was statistically significantly associated with secondary outcome.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR is associated with outcomes in unselected critically ill patients.\n\n In patients with sepsis, there was no statistically significant relationship between NLR and mortality.\n\n Further investigation is required to increase understanding of the

China","abstract":"Background\nSince December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7092819","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical Society","authors":[{"firstname":"Wei-jie","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng-yi","surname":"Ni","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng-yi","surname":"Ni","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yu","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wen-hua","surname":"Liang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chun-quan","surname":"Ou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jian-xing","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Shan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chun-liang","surname":"Lei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"David S.C.","surname":"Hui","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Du","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lan-juan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guang","surname":"Zeng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kwok-Yung","surname":"Yuen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ru-chong","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chun-li","surname":"Tang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tao","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ping-yan","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jie","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shi-yue","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jin-lin","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zi-jing","surname":"Liang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi-xiang","surname":"Peng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Li","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ya-hua","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Peng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jian-ming","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ji-yang","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhong","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gang","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhi-jian","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shao-qin","surname":"Qiu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jie","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chang-jiang","surname":"Ye","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shao-yong","surname":"Zhu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nan-shan","surname":"Zhong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical features predicting mortality risk in patients with viral pneumonia: the MuLBSTA Score","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical courses and outcomes of hospitalized adult patients with seasonal influenza in Korea, 2011-2012: Hospital-based Influenza Morbidity &amp;

This study aims to investigate its epidemiologic history, and analyze the clinical characteristics, treatment regimens, and prognosis of patients infected with 2019-nCoV during this outbreak.\n\n\nMethods\nClinical data from 137 2019-nCoV-infected patients admitted to the respiratory departments of nine tertiary hospitals in Hubei province from December 30, 2019 to January 24, 2020 were retrospectively collected, including general status, clinical manifestations, laboratory test results, imaging characteristics, and treatment regimens.\n\n\nResults\nNone of the 137 patients (61 males, 76 females, aged 20–83 years, median age 57 years) had a definite history of exposure to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market.\n\n Major initial symptoms included fever (112/137, 81.8%), coughing (66/137, 48.2%), and muscle pain or fatigue (44/137, 32.1%), with other, less typical initial symptoms observed at low frequency, including heart palpitations, diarrhea, and headache.\n\n Nearly 80% of the patients had normal or decreased white blood cell counts, and 72.3% (99/137) had lymphocytopenia.\n\n Lung involvement was present in all cases, with most chest computed tomography scans showing lesions in multiple lung lobes, some of which were dense; ground-glass opacity co-existed with consolidation shadows or cord-like shadows.\n\n Given the lack of effective drugs, treatment focused on symptomatic and respiratory support.\n\n Immunoglobulin G was delivered to some critically ill patients according to their conditions.\n\n Systemic corticosteroid treatment did not show significant benefits.\n\n Notably, early respiratory support facilitated disease recovery and improved prognosis.\n\n The risk of death was primarily associated with age, underlying chronic diseases, and median interval from the appearance of initial symptoms to dyspnea.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe majority of patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia present with fever as the first symptom, and most of them still showed typical manifestations of viral pneumonia on chest imaging.\n\n Middle-aged and elderly patients with underlying comorbidities are susceptible to respiratory failure and may have a poorer prognosis.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7147277","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Wolters Kluwer

associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile

Finally, by highlighting the potency and the evasiveness of SARS-CoV-2, the study provides insight into intervention strategies that target its cell entry mechanisms.\n","id":"PMC7260975","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"National Academy of

ACE phenotyping in prostate cancer","abstract":"Epithelial cells of prostate express significant level of ACE and, as a result, seminal fluid has 50-fold more ACE than plasma.\n The substitution of highly specialized prostate epithelial cells by tumor cells results in dramatic decrease in ACE production in prostate tissues.\n We performed detailed characterization of ACE status in prostate tissues from patients with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer (PC) using new approach- ACE phenotyping, that includes evaluation of: 1) ACE activity with two substrates (HHL and ZPHL); 2) the ratio of the rates of their hydrolysis (ZPHL/HHL ratio); 3) the ratio of immunoreactive ACE protein to ACE activity; 4) the pattern of mAbs binding to different epitopes on ACE – ACE conformational fingerprint - to reveal conformational changes in prostate ACE due to prostate pathology.\n ACE activity dramatically decreased and the ratio of immunoreactive ACE protein to ACE activity increased in PC tissues.\n The catalytic parameter, ZPHL/HHL ratio, increased in prostate tissues from all patients with PC, but was did not change for most |BPH patients.\n Nevertheless, prostate tissues of several patients diagnosed with BPH based on histology, also demonstrated decreased ACE activity and increased immunoreactive ACE protein/ACE activity and ZPHL/HHL ratios, that could be considered as more early indicators of prostate cancer development than routine histology.\n Thus, ACE phenotyping of prostate biopsies has a potential to be an effective approach for early diagnostics of prostate cancer or at least for differential diagnostics of BPH and PC.\n","id":"PMC6824872","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Impact Journals

mechanisms and applications","abstract":"Viral and bacterial infections are involved in the development of human cancers, such as liver, nasopharyngeal, cervical, head and neck, and gastric cancers.\n Aberrant DNA methylation is frequently present in these cancers, and some of the aberrantly methylated genes are causally involved in cancer development and progression.\n Notably, aberrant DNA methylation can be present even in non-cancerous or precancerous tissues, and its levels correlate with the risk of cancer development, producing a so-called ‘epigenetic field for cancerization’.\n Mechanistically, most viral or bacterial infections induce DNA methylation indirectly via chronic inflammation, but recent studies have indicated that some viruses have direct effects on the epigenetic machinery of host cells.\n From a translational viewpoint, a recent multicenter prospective cohort study demonstrated that assessment of the extent of alterations in DNA methylation in non-cancerous tissues can be used to predict cancer risk.\n Furthermore, suppression of aberrant DNA methylation was shown to be a useful strategy for cancer prevention in an animal model.\n Here, we review the involvement of aberrant DNA methylation in various types of infection-associated cancers, along with individual induction mechanisms, and we discuss the application of these findings for cancer prevention, diagnosis, and therapy.\n","id":"PMC4731931","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese

We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7121484","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical Society","authors":[{"firstname":"Qun","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuhua","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoye","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yeqing","surname":"Tong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ruiqi","surname":"Ren","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kathy S.M.","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Eric H.Y.","surname":"Lau","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jessica Y.","surname":"Wong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuesen","surname":"Xing","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nijuan","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chao","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tian","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Man","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wenxiao","surname":"Tu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chuding","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lianmei","surname":"Jin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rui","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Suhua","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rui","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yinbo","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ge","surname":"Shao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhongfa","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhiqiang","surname":"Deng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Boxi","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhitao","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yanping","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guoqing","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tommy T.Y.","surname":"Lam","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Joseph T.","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"George F.","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Benjamin J.","surname":"Cowling","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gabriel M.","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zijian","surname":"Feng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30566-3","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study","abstract":"Background\nSince December, 2019, Wuhan, China, has experienced an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).\n\n Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (?18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.\n\n\nFindings\n191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital.\n\n 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients).\n\n Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·03–1·17, per year increase; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·61–12·23; p&lt;0·0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL (18·42, 2·64–128·55; p=0·0033) on admission.\n\n Median duration of viral shedding was 20·0 days (IQR 17·0–24·0) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors.\n\n The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage.\n\n Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.\n\n\nFunding\nChinese Academy of Medical Sciences Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences; National Science Grant for Distinguished Young Scholars; National Key

In conclusion, myocardial injury occurs in significant proportion of hospitalized Covid-19 patients and is an independent predictor of clinical outcomes, with higher values associated with worse outcomes.\nIntroduction\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has caused a global pandemic resulting in thousands of deaths worldwide. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent for coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), infects cells through spike (S) protein binding to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, found primarily in the alveolar lung cells, heart, and gastrointestinal tract. Cardiac injury reflected by elevated cardiac troponin I (cTnI) concentrations among infected patients has been shown in multiple studies, and was also shown to be a predictor of mortality. Among those with elevated cTnI, it is unknown whether higher values are associated with a further increase in mortality. Thus, the primary objectives of our study are: (i) to determine if elevated cTnI is an independent predictor of mortality in hospitalized Covid-19 patients, and (ii) whether incremental cTnI values are associated with further increase in mortality in the same cohort. The secondary objectives of our study are: (i) to determine if elevated cTnI is an independent predictor for need for mechanical ventilation, dialysis, and transfer to intensive care unit (ICU) in hospitalized Covid-19 patients, and (ii) whether incremental cTnI values are associated with further increase in those outcomes in the same cohort.\nMethods\nThis study was a case-series conducted at Phoebe Putney Health System (PPHS), the largest community health system in Southwest Georgia, serving 42 counties and approximately 815,000 population. The PPHS institutional review board approved the study and waived the requirement for informed consent due to minimal risk. The original study showing demographics and baseline characteristics for this study population is published somewhere else. Confirmed Covid-19 positive patients were admitted to any of the 3 Phoebe Putney hospitals between March 2, 2020 and June 7, 2020, inclusive of those dates. Patients who had at least 1 cTnI value during hospitalization, and had an outcome were included in the analysis. The outcome was defined as discharged alive or death during hospitalization. Hospitalized patients who did not have an outcome by the end of the study period or did not have at least 1 cTnI measurement during hospitalization were not included in the analysis. The patients transferred to another hospital (due to the hospital being at full capacity or need for treatment not available at our facility) were not included as well.\nData were collected from the electronic medical records (Meditech and Athena Health). Data collection included demographics, insurance, baseline comorbidities, tobacco use, alcohol use, illicit drug use, home medications, symptoms on presentation, vitals, laboratory test results, initial electrocardiogram, the severity of presenting illness, treatment course (intensive care unit [ICU] care, need for mechanical ventilation and dialysis), length of stay (LOS), and outcomes (discharged alive or death). The comorbidities included hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, chronic kidney disease (CKD), cancer, immunosuppression, and chronic liver disease. All comorbidities except immunosuppression were adjudicated based on the 10th version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). Patients were considered immunosuppressed if they had been on chronic steroids or other immunosuppressive therapy. The highest values of cTnI, D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), ferritin, procalcitonin, and C-reactive protein (CRP) were used for analysis. Severe Covid-19 was defined if ARDS, septic shock, or severe pneumonia was present on admission. A decision to intubate or transfer to ICU was at the discretion of the attending physician. The standardized laboratory value of the upper limit of the 99th percentile of normal cTnI is 0.05 ng/ml at our institution, and any value above this was considered elevated in this study. The decision to order cTnI was at the discretion of the treating physician. Accordingly, patients were divided into 2 groups: with and without elevated troponin.\nWe utilized Statistical Analysis Software (SAS) version 9.4 (Cary, NC) for all the statistical analyses. Categorical variables were expressed in numbers and percentages and analyzed using the Pearson chi-square test. Continuous variables were expressed in mean +- standard deviation and analyzed using the Student's T-test. Hierarchical multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to adjust for variation in baseline characteristics. In this model, we included age, gender, race, body mass index, comorbidities, presenting illness severity, D-dimer, LDH, procalcitonin, ferritin, and CRP. C-statistics was above 0.7 for all the models to be acceptable. To determine if the higher value of cTnI was associated with worse outcomes, we divided cTnI values in 4 groups: normal values (&lt;0.05 ng/ml), 0 to 50th percentile (0.05 to 0.22 ng/ml), 50 to 75th percentile (0.23 to 0.73 ng/ml) and 75 to 100th percentile (&gt;0.73 ng/ml).\nResults\nDemographics, comorbidities, laboratory parameters, and outcomes in hospitalized Covid-19 patients with and without elevated troponins\nTable 1	 	\nCharacteristics	Elevated Troponin	P Value	 		No (N=193)	Yes (N=116)		 	Mean age (years)	59.9+-14.0	68.2+-14.1	&lt;0.001	 	Women	123 (63.7 %)	54 (46.5 %)	0.003	 	Mean Body mass index, kg/m2	35.8+-10.1	33.6+-9.8	0.06	 	White	22 (11.4 %)	15 (12.9 %)	0.28	 	Black	167 (86.5 %)	101 (87.1 %)		 	Others	4 (2.1 %)	0 (0)		 	Hypertension	153 (79.3 %)	108 (93.1 %)	0.001	 	Coronary artery disease	9 (4.7 %)	19 (16.4 %)	&lt;0.001	 	Congestive heart failure	28 (14.5 %)	37 (31.9 %)	&lt;0.001	 	Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease	20 (10.4 %)	17 (14.7 %)	0.26	 	Asthma	34 (17.6 %)	17 (14.7 %)	0.50	 	Chronic kidney disease	19 (9.8 %)	29 (33.6 %)	&lt;0.001	 	End stage renal disease (dialysis)	3 (1.8 %)	18 (17.3 %)	&lt;0.001	 	Diabetes	86 (44.6 %)	57 (49.1 %)	0.43	 	Cancer	22 (11.4 %)	12 (10.3 %)	0.77	 	Immunosuppression	9 (4.7 %)	9 (7.8 %)	0.26	 	Chronic liver disease	2 (1 %)	3 (2.6 %)	0.29	 	Smoking	29 (15 %)	28 (24.1 %)	0.04	 	Severe Covid-19 disease	95 (49.2 %)	59 (50.9 %)	0.78	 	Laboratory Values				 	D-Dimer (mcg/ml)	4.8+-4.2	6.1+-5.2	0.019	 	Lactate Dehydrogenase (U/L)	429+-408	448+-311	0.66	 	Procalcitonin (ng/ml)	5.1+-17.5	10.5+-25.3	&lt;0.001	 	Ferritin (ng/ml)	1600+-2922	2983+-3605	&lt;0.001	 	C-Reactive Protein (mg/L)	16.1+-10.4	18.6+-10.7	&lt;0.001	 	In-hospital Outcomes				 	In-hospital Mortality	22 (11.4 %)	44 (37.9 %)	&lt;0.001	 	New Dialysis Requirement	5 (2.6 %)	13 (11.2 %)	0.002	 	Mechanical Ventilation	38 (19.7 %)	49 (42.2 %)	&lt;0.001	 	Intensive Care Unit Transfer	52 (26.9 %)	58 (50.0 %)	&lt;0.001	 	\nOutcomes stratified by 4 different groups based on cardiac troponin I level.\nGroup 1: Normal value &lt; 0.05 ng/ml; Group 2: 0 to 50th percentile and value of cardiac troponin I = 0.05 to 0.22 ng/ml; Group 3: 51 to 75th Percentile and value of cardiac troponin I = 0.22 to 0.73 ng/ml; Group 4: 75th to 100th percentile and value of cardiac troponin I = &gt;0.73 ng/ml.\nFigure 1\nA total of 635 consecutive patient records were reviewed, out of which cTnI was measured at least once during the hospitalization in 309 patients. Out of 309 total patients, 116 (37.5%) had elevated cTnI. Those with elevated cTnI were older (59.9 vs. 68.2 years, p &lt;0.001), and more likely to be males (53.5% vs. 36.3%, p = 0.003). Majority of the patients were African Americans in both groups (~ 87%). Patients with elevated cTnI were more likely to have hypertension (93.1% vs. 79.3%, p = 0.001), coronary artery disease (16.4% vs. 4.7%, p &lt;0.001), congestive heart failure (31.9% vs. 14.5%, p &lt;0.001), chronic kidney disease (33.6% vs. 9.8%, p &lt;0.001), and dialysis (17.3% vs. 1.8%, p &lt;0.001) at baseline (Table 1 ). They also had higher D-dimer, procalcitonin, ferritin, and C-reactive protein levels (Table 1). After multivariable adjustment, overall mortality was significantly higher in elevated cTnI group (37.9% vs. 11.4%, odds ratio {OR}:4.45; confidence interval {CI}:1.78 to 11.14, p &lt;0.001). The need for mechanical ventilation (42.2% vs. 19.7%, OR:5.18; CI: 2.12 to 12.69, p &lt;0.001), and transfer to ICU (50% vs. 26.9%, OR:4.95; CI:2.19 to 11.17, p &lt;0.001) were also significantly higher in elevated cTnI group (Table 1). With higher cTnI levels, the mortality increases further. Among those with elevated cTnI, mortality was 23.2% for 50th percentile, 48.4% for 75th percentile, and 55.2% for 100th percentile. The need for new dialysis, mechanical ventilation, and ICU care was significantly higher in patients with higher cTnI (Figure 1 ).\nDiscussion\nOur results indicate that more than one-third of the patients hospitalized with Covid-19 have evidence of cardiac injury, assessed by elevated cTnI, and is an independent predictor of mortality. The prevalence of myocardial injury in our study was higher than reported in studies from China. These studies reported a prevalence ranging from 7% to 28% compared to 37.5% in our study. But a recent study from New York showed a similar prevalence of myocardial injury in hospitalized Covid-19 patients. There is evidence to suggest acute myocardial injury at hospital admission is also associated with increased in-hospital mortality in Covid-19. However, ours is the first study to demonstrate increased mortality with higher cTnI levels. In our study, the mortality was 5 times higher for patients with troponins in the highest quartile compared to those with normal troponin values. Similar to previous studies, we found that patients with myocardial injury were older, had a higher prevalence of the cardiovascular disease, and had higher inflammatory markers.   Possible mechanisms of myocardial injury in Covid-19 include direct damage to the cardiomyocytes, systemic inflammation, myocardial interstitial fibrosis, interferon -mediated immune response, exaggerated cytokine response by Type 1 and 2 helper T cells, coronary plaque destabilization, oxygen supply-demand mismatch, microembolic infarcts, hyperadrenergic state, and pulmonary embolism.   Based on the Fourth Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction, there were very few patients who met the strict criteria for acute myocardial infarction. Although we could not ascertain the etiology of myocardial injury in all the patients, the majority were believed to have a noncoronary mediated mechanism. This remains an ongoing challenge and none of the previous studies have been able to identify the etiology of myocardial injury in Covid-19 patients.\nThe decision to measure cTnI was at the discretion of the treating physician and hence there is a selection bias based on cTnI measurement. Since we used electronic medical records, some data elements might not be accurately captured. We did not have electrocardiograms and echocardiograms in all patients at the time of troponin measurement to correlate with troponin elevations.\nMyocardial injury is present in a significant proportion of hospitalized Covid-19 patients. Even though respiratory symptoms are the most common presentation, cTnI is a relatively cheap test to risk-stratify patients based on their cTnI level which has prognostic value and is independently associated with higher mortality as shown in this study. Future studies should explore the etiology as well as best management strategies in Covid-19 patients with evidence of myocardial injury.\nAuthors' contribution\nPriyank Shah: Conceptualization, data curation, formal analysis, methodology, writing original draft, review and editing.

Aberrant DNA methylation is frequently present in these cancers, and some of the aberrantly methylated genes are causally involved in cancer development and progression.\n Notably, aberrant DNA methylation can be present even in non-cancerous or precancerous tissues, and its levels correlate with the risk of cancer development, producing a so-called ‘epigenetic field for cancerization’.\n Mechanistically, most viral or bacterial infections induce DNA methylation indirectly via chronic inflammation, but recent studies have indicated that some viruses have direct effects on the epigenetic machinery of host cells.\n From a translational viewpoint, a recent multicenter prospective cohort study demonstrated that assessment of the extent of alterations in DNA methylation in non-cancerous tissues can be used to predict cancer risk.\n Furthermore, suppression of aberrant DNA methylation was shown to be a useful strategy for cancer prevention in an animal model.\n Here, we review the involvement of aberrant DNA methylation in various types of infection-associated cancers, along with individual induction mechanisms, and we discuss the application of these findings for

of myocardial injury, as reflected by troponin elevation, and associated outcomes among U.\n\nS.\n\n hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) are unknown.\n\n\nObjectives\nThe purpose of this study was to describe the degree of myocardial injury and associated outcomes in a large hospitalized cohort with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19.\nMethods\nPatients with COVID-19 admitted to 1 of 5 Mount Sinai Health System hospitals in New York City between February 27, 2020, and April 12, 2020, with troponin-I (normal value &lt;0.03 ng/ml) measured within 24 h of admission were included (n = 2,736).\n\n Demographics, medical histories, admission laboratory results, and outcomes were captured from the hospitals’ electronic health records.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age was 66.4 years, with 59.6% men.\n\n Cardiovascular disease (CVD), including coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure, was more prevalent in patients with higher troponin concentrations, as were hypertension and diabetes.\n\n A total of 506 (18.5%) patients died during hospitalization.\n\n In all, 985 (36%) patients had elevated troponin concentrations.\n\n After adjusting for disease severity and relevant clinical factors, even small amounts of myocardial injury (e.\n\ng.\n\n, troponin I &gt;0.03 to 0.09 ng/ml; n = 455; 16.6%) were significantly associated with death (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.75; 95% CI: 1.37 to 2.24; p &lt; 0.001) while greater amounts (e.\n\ng.\n\n, troponin I &gt;0.09 ng/dl; n = 530; 19.4%) were significantly associated with higher risk (adjusted HR: 3.03; 95% CI: 2.42 to 3.80; p &lt; 0.001).\n\n\nConclusions\nMyocardial injury is prevalent among patients hospitalized with COVID-19; however, troponin concentrations were generally present at low levels.\n\n Patients with CVD are more likely to have myocardial injury than patients without CVD.\n\n Troponin elevation among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is associated with higher risk of mortality.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7279721","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

Patients With Non-ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction","abstract":"Background\nUp-sloping ST-segment depression has not been historically considered as representing ischemia as this electrocardiographic change can be seen in normal subjects during exercise stress testing or tachycardia.\n\n We aimed to clarify the prevalence and clinical significance of up-sloping ST-segment depression in patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed a retrospective analysis of 330 consecutive patients with NSTEMI who underwent coronary angiography.\n\n ST-segment depression ? 0.05 mV in more than two contiguous leads was recorded and categorized as being up-sloping or non-up-sloping.\n\n\nResults\nOf 330 patients, 109 patients (33%) had ST-segment depression; six of these patients had up-sloping ST-segment depression.\n\n All six patients with up-sloping ST-segment depression had a culprit lesion and underwent in-hospital revascularization.\n\n Three of these six patients had a culprit lesion in the left anterior descending artery; the culprit lesion in two others was in the left circumflex artery, while one patient had severe three-vessel disease.\n\n No statistically significant difference was found in the rate of in-hospital revascularization between patients with up-sloping and non-up-sloping ST-segment depression (100% vs.\n\n 75%, P = 0.33).\n\n\nConclusions\nPatients with up-sloping ST-segment depression had a comparable rate of in-hospital revascularization compared to those with non-up-sloping ST-segment depression, suggesting that up-sloping ST-segment depression should be recognized as a manifestation of ischemia in NSTEMI.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5295568","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elmer

0.001).\n\n In-hospital mortality of RBBB patients was similar to LBBB (14.3 vs.\n\n 13.1%, P = 0.661).\n\n Patients with new or presumably new blocks had the highest (LBBB 15.8% and RBBB 15.4%) incidence of cardiogenic shock from all ECG subgroups.\n\n Percutaneous coronary intervention was done more frequently (84.8%) in patients with new or presumably new RBBB when compared with other patients with blocks (old RBBB 66.0%, old LBBB 62.3%, new or presumably new LBBB 73.0%).\n\n In-hospital mortality was highest (18.8%) among patients presenting with new or presumably new RBBB, followed by new or presumably new LBBB (13.2%), old LBBB (10.1%), and old RBBB (6.4%).\n\n Among 35 patients with acute left main coronary artery occlusion, 26% presented with RBBB (mostly with LAH) on the admission ECG.\n\n\nConclusion\nAcute myocardial infarction with RBBB is frequently caused by the complete occlusion of the infarct-related artery and is more frequently treated with primary PCI when compared with AMI + LBBB.\n\n In-hospital mortality of patients with AMI and RBBB is highest from all ECG presentations of AMI.\n\n Restoration of coronary flow by primary PCI may lead to resolution of the conduction delay on the discharge ECG.\n\n Right bundle branch block should strongly be considered for listing in future guidelines as a standard indication for reperfusion therapy, in the same way as LBBB.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3249219","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Oxford University Press","authors":[{"firstname":"Petr","surname":"Widimsky","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Filip","surname":"Rohá?","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Josef","surname":"Štásek","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Petr","surname":"Kala","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Richard","surname":"Rokyta","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Boyko","surname":"Kuzmanov","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Martin","surname":"Jakl","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Martin","surname":"Poloczek","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jan","surname":"Ka?ovský","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ivo","surname":"Bernat","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ota","surname":"Hlinomaz","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jan","surname":"B?lohlávek","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ales","surname":"Král","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Vratislav","surname":"Mrázek","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Vladimir","surname":"Grigorov","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Slaveyko","surname":"Djambazov","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Robert","surname":"Petr","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jiri","surname":"Knot","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Dana","surname":"Bílková","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Michaela","surname":"Fischerová","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Karel","surname":"Vondrák","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Marek","surname":"Malý","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alena","surname":"Lorencová","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1161/01.CIR.10.4.564","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Recommendations for Standardization of Electrocardiographic and Vectorcardiographic Leads","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]}]}]}]}
