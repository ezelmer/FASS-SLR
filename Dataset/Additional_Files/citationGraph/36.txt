The SARS-CoV-2 disease was officially given the name of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) on 11 February, 2020. In this study, we examine which treatments are being used, assess clinical and laboratory features and short-term outcomes of patients with COVID-19 in intensive care unit (ICU). \nThis retrospective case series involved 102 adult patients with COVID-19 admitted to Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital in Wuhan, China, between January 3 and February 1, 2020. All those patients received a laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis. Epidemiological, clinical, radiological characteristics, underlying diseases, laboratory tests at admission and during hospitalization, treatment, complications and outcomes data were collected. Patients outcomes (discharge or death) and admission to ICU (yes or no) were followed up at discharge until February 15, 2020. The study was approved by Zhongnan Hospital Ethics Committee, and oral consent was obtained from patients or relatives.\nThe timeline of SARS-CoV-2 onset in ICU patients. a Timeline of SARS-CoV-2 onset in ICU survivors (N = 12). b Timeline of SARS-CoV-2 onset in ICU non- survivors (N = 6). The results were presented as number (%). The onset of symptom was defined as day 0. The points represent the median value. ICU, intensive care unit; SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; MV, mechanical ventilation; NV, noninvasive ventilation; IMV, invasive mechanical ventilation; EMCO, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; OI, oxygen inhalation; ACI, acute cardiac injury; AKI, acute kidney injury; ALI, acute liver injury\nDemographic details of the included 102 patients are shown in the supplementary table 1. All patients were isolated. Seventeen patients died (discharge mortality, 16.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 9.4-23.9%), and eighteen patients were admitted to the ICU with a rate of 17.6% (95% CI, 10.2-25.0%). The reasons for admission included need for mechanical ventilation (N = 6), breathing rate increases/oxygen saturation &lt; 90%/no-compliance with noninvasive ventilator (N = 7), and combined shock and/or organ failure (N = 5). The timeline of SARS-CoV-2 onset in ICU patients is shown in Fig. 1. The ICU patients were older (66[54-76] vs. 31[35-62]) and more likely exposed to source of transmission (66.7% vs. 40.2%) when compared to the non-ICU patients. Health care workers were less likely admitted to the ICU (0% vs. 28.2%). ICU patients more likely suffered from comorbidities (Any [100.0% vs. 34.5%]; hypertension [55.5% vs. 21.4%]; and chronic liver disease [11.1% vs. 0%]). Those patents needed more time to confirm the laboratory diagnosis (12[7-19] vs. 8[4-11]). They also needed longer hospital stays (15[8-21] vs. 10[7-14]) and more medical expenses (62,556[48,938-160,629] vs. 12,808[8166-27,691] CNY, See the supplementary table 1).\nAs shown in the supplementary table 1, the treatment in ICU included the administration of a antiviral therapy (100.0%), the use of antibiotics (100.0%), glucocorticoid therapy (61.1%), oxygen inhalation (61.1%), noninvasive ventilation (11.1%), invasive mechanical ventilation (38.9%), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (16.7%) and CRRT (22.2%). Furthermore, there were no significant difference in drugs treatment, oxygen inhalation and noninvasive ventilation between ICU group and non-ICU group (P &gt; 0.05 all). ICU patients received more intensive treatment with invasive mechanical ventilation (38.9% vs. 4.8%), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (16.7% vs. 0%) and CRRT (22.2% vs. 2.4%). They also more likely suffered from in-hospital complications (ARDS [44.4% vs. 14.3%]; acute infection [38.9% vs. 11.9%]; acute cardiac injury [33.3% vs. 10.7%]; arrhythmia [38.9% vs. 13.1%]; acute kidney injury [44.4% vs. 14.3%] and acute liver injury [66.7% vs. 26.2%]). ICU patients had a higher mortality rate than non-ICU patients (33.3% vs. 13.1%), but this difference was not significant (P = 0.081).\nOur results suggest that ICU patients suffer at admission from more comorbidities and develop many complications due to hospitalization. During hospitalization they receive more aggressive treatment, and can result in a similar mortality when compared to non-ICU patients. We found that 17.6% of patients required admission to the ICU and 16.7% died. A previous study including 138 patients with COVID-19 showed that 26% of patients required admission to the ICU and 4.3% died. Another study reported that 23% of patients with COVID-19 required admission to the ICU and 11.0% died. It should be noted that most patients in those two studies were still hospitalized at the time of manuscript submission. Our hospital is one of the major tertiary teaching hospitals and is responsible for the treatment of critically ill patients with COVID-19. Thus, our cohort might represent the more severe COVID-19 patients and the rates of death and ICU admission may be overestimated. A recent large-sample and multicenter study showed that only 5% of the included COVID-19 patients were admitted to ICU and 1.36% succumbed.\nElectronic supplementary material\nBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material.\nThe original version of this article was revised: There was an error in Xiaorong Hu's name.\nPublisher's Note\nSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.\nJianlei Cao and Xiaorong Hu have contributed equally to this work.\nChange history\n4/14/2020\nThe original version of this article unfortunately contained a mistake.

quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.\n\n Increasing quartile of NLR was statistically significantly associated with secondary outcome.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR is associated with outcomes in unselected critically ill patients.\n\n In patients with sepsis, there was no statistically significant relationship between NLR and mortality.\n\n Further investigation is required to increase understanding of the pathophysiology of this relationship and to validate these findings with data collected prospectively.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article

recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like

collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had

bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens from five patients with severe pneumonia from Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, Hubei province, China.\n\n Nucleic acids of the BAL were extracted and subjected to next-generation sequencing.\n\n Virus isolation was carried out, and maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees were constructed.\n\n\nResults\nFive patients hospitalized from December 18 to December 29, 2019 presented with fever, cough, and dyspnea accompanied by complications of acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n Chest radiography revealed diffuse opacities and consolidation.\n\n One of these patients died.\n\n Sequence results revealed the presence of a previously unknown ?-CoV strain in all five patients, with 99.8% to 99.9% nucleotide identities among the isolates.\n\n These isolates showed 79.0% nucleotide identity with the sequence of SARS-CoV (GenBank NC_004718) and 51.8% identity with the sequence of MERS-CoV (GenBank NC_019843).\n\n The virus is phylogenetically closest to a

coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7121484","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical Society","authors":[{"firstname":"Qun","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuhua","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoye","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yeqing","surname":"Tong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ruiqi","surname":"Ren","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kathy S.M.","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Eric H.Y.","surname":"Lau","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jessica Y.","surname":"Wong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuesen","surname":"Xing","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nijuan","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chao","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tian","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Man","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wenxiao","surname":"Tu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chuding","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lianmei","surname":"Jin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rui","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Suhua","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rui","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yinbo","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ge","surname":"Shao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhongfa","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhiqiang","surname":"Deng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Boxi","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhitao","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yanping","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guoqing","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tommy T.Y.","surname":"Lam","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Joseph T.","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"George F.","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Benjamin J.","surname":"Cowling","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gabriel M.","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zijian","surname":"Feng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"30 January 2020 pneumonia epidemic situation of C SARS-CoV-2 infection in Hubei province, China-Hubei Provincial Health Committee","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"4 February 2020 pneumonia epidemic situation of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Hubei province, China-Hubei Provincial Health Committee","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30211-7","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study","abstract":"Background\nIn December, 2019, a pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China.\n\n We aimed to further clarify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020.

Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data. Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection. Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).

Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission.\nIntroduction\nCoronaviruses are enveloped non-segmented positive-sense RNA viruses belonging to the family Coronaviridae and the order Nidovirales and broadly distributed in humans and other mammals. Although most human coronavirus infections are mild, the epidemics of the two betacoronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), have caused more than 10 000 cumulative cases in the past two decades, with mortality rates of 10% for SARS-CoV and 37% for MERS-CoV. The coronaviruses already identified might only be the tip of the iceberg, with potentially more novel and severe zoonotic events to be revealed.\nIn December, 2019, a series of pneumonia cases of unknown cause emerged in Wuhan, Hubei, China, with clinical presentations greatly resembling viral pneumonia. Deep sequencing analysis from lower respiratory tract samples indicated a novel coronavirus, which was named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Thus far, more than 800 confirmed cases, including in health-care workers, have been identified in Wuhan, and several exported cases have been confirmed in other provinces in China, and in Thailand, Japan, South Korea, and the USA. \nResearch in context\n Evidence before this study \nHuman coronaviruses, including hCoV-229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1, cause mild respiratory diseases. Fatal coronavirus infections that have emerged in the past two decades are severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. We searched PubMed and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure database for articles published up to Jan 11, 2020, using the keywords &quot;novel coronovirus&quot;, &quot;2019 novel coronavirus&quot;, or &quot;2019-nCoV&quot;. No published work about the human infection caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) could be identified.\n Added value of this study \nWe report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics, treatment, and clinical outcomes of 41 laboratory-confirmed cases infected with 2019-nCoV. 27 (66%) of 41 patients had a history of direct exposure to the Huanan seafood market. The median age of patients was 49 0 years (IQR 41 0-58 0), and 13 (32%) patients had underlying disease. All patients had pneumonia. A third of patients were admitted to intensive care units, and six died. High concentrations of cytokines were recorded in plasma of critically ill patients infected with 2019-nCoV.\n Implications of all the available evidence \n2019-nCoV caused clusters of fatal pneumonia with clinical presentation greatly resembling SARS-CoV. Patients infected with 2019-nCoV might develop acute respiratory distress syndrome, have a high likelihood of admission to intensive care, and might die. The cytokine storm could be associated with disease severity. More efforts should be made to know the whole spectrum and pathophysiology of the new disease.\nWe aim to describe epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics, treatment, and outcomes of patients confirmed to have 2019-nCoV infection, and to compare the clinical features between intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU patients. We hope our study findings will inform the global community of the emergence of this novel coronavirus and its clinical features.\nMethods\nPatients\nFollowing the pneumonia cases of unknown cause reported in Wuhan and considering the shared history of exposure to Huanan seafood market across the patients, an epidemiological alert was released by the local health authority on Dec 31, 2019, and the market was shut down on Jan 1, 2020. Meanwhile, 59 suspected cases with fever and dry cough were transferred to a designated hospital starting from Dec 31, 2019. An expert team of physicians, epidemiologists, virologists, and government officials was soon formed after the alert.\nSince the cause was unknown at the onset of these emerging infections, the diagnosis of pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan was based on clinical characteristics, chest imaging, and the ruling out of common bacterial and viral pathogens that cause pneumonia. Suspected patients were isolated using airborne precautions in the designated hospital, Jin Yin-tan Hospital (Wuhan, China), and fit-tested N95 masks and airborne precautions for aerosol-generating procedures were taken. This study was approved by the National Health Commission of China and Ethics Commission of Jin Yin-tan Hospital (KY-2020-01.01). Written informed consent was waived by the Ethics Commission of the designated hospital for emerging infectious diseases.\nProcedures\nLocal centres for disease control and prevention collected respiratory, blood, and faeces specimens, then shipped them to designated authoritative laboratories to detect the pathogen (NHC Key Laboratory of Systems Biology of Pathogens and Christophe Merieux Laboratory, Beijing, China). A novel coronavirus, which was named 2019-nCoV, was isolated then from lower respiratory tract specimen and a diagnostic test for this virus was developed soon after that. Of 59 suspected cases, 41 patients were confirmed to be infected with 2019-nCoV. The presence of 2019-nCoV in respiratory specimens was detected by next-generation sequencing or real-time RT-PCR methods. The primers and probe target to envelope gene of CoV were used and the sequences were as follows: forward primer 5'-ACTTCTTTTTCTTGCTTTCGTGGT-3'; reverse primer 5'-GCAGCAGTACGCACACAATC-3'; and the probe 5'CY5-CTAGTTACACTAGCCATCCTTACTGC-3'BHQ1. Conditions for the amplifications were 50 C for 15 min, 95 C for 3 min, followed by 45 cycles of 95 C for 15 s and 60 C for 30 s.\nInitial investigations included a complete blood count, coagulation profile, and serum biochemical test (including renal and liver function, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and electrolytes). Respiratory specimens, including nasal and pharyngeal swabs, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, sputum, or bronchial aspirates were tested for common viruses, including influenza, avian influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV using real-time RT-PCR assays approved by the China Food and Drug Administration. Routine bacterial and fungal examinations were also performed.\nGiven the emergence of the 2019-nCoV pneumonia cases during the influenza season, antibiotics (orally and intravenously) and oseltamivir (orally 75 mg twice daily) were empirically administered. Corticosteroid therapy (methylprednisolone 40-120 mg per day) was given as a combined regimen if severe community-acquired pneumonia was diagnosed by physicians at the designated hospital. Oxygen support (eg, nasal cannula and invasive mechanical ventilation) was administered to patients according to the severity of hypoxaemia. Repeated tests for 2019-nCoV were done in patients confirmed to have 2019-nCoV infection to show viral clearance before hospital discharge or discontinuation of isolation.\nData collection\nWe reviewed clinical charts, nursing records, laboratory findings, and chest x-rays for all patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection who were reported by the local health authority. The admission data of these patients was from Dec 16, 2019, to Jan 2, 2020. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and outcomes data were obtained with standardised data collection forms (modified case record form for severe acute respiratory infection clinical characterisation shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium) from electronic medical records. Two researchers also independently reviewed the data collection forms to double check the data collected. To ascertain the epidemiological and symptom data, which were not available from electronic medical records, the researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\nCytokine and chemokine measurement\nTo characterise the effect of coronavirus on the production of cytokines or chemokines in the acute phase of the illness, plasma cytokines and chemokines (IL1B, IL1RA, IL2, IL4, IL5, IL6, IL7, IL8 (also known as CXCL8), IL9, IL10, IL12p70, IL13, IL15, IL17A, Eotaxin (also known as CCL11), basic FGF2, GCSF (CSF3), GMCSF (CSF2), IFNgamma, IP10 (CXCL10), MCP1 (CCL2), MIP1A (CCL3), MIP1B (CCL4), PDGFB, RANTES (CCL5), TNFalpha, and VEGFA were measured using Human Cytokine Standard 27-Plex Assays panel and the Bio-Plex 200 system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) for all patients according to the manufacturer's instructions. The plasma samples from four healthy adults were used as controls for cross-comparison. The median time from being transferred to a designated hospital to the blood sample collection was 4 days (IQR 2-5).\nDetection of coronavirus in plasma\nEach 80 muL plasma sample from the patients and contacts was added into 240 muL of Trizol LS (10296028; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Carlsbad, CA, USA) in the Biosafety Level 3 laboratory. Total RNA was extracted by Direct-zol RNA Miniprep kit (R2050; Zymo research, Irvine, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions and 50 muL elution was obtained for each sample. 5 muL RNA was used for real-time RT-PCR, which targeted the NP gene using AgPath-ID One-Step RT-PCR Reagent (AM1005; Thermo Fisher Scientific). The final reaction mix concentration of the primers was 500 nM and probe was 200 nM. Real-time RT-PCR was performed using the following conditions: 50 C for 15 min and 95 C for 3 min, 50 cycles of amplification at 95 C for 10 s and 60 C for 45 s. Since we did not perform tests for detecting infectious virus in blood, we avoided the term viraemia and used RNAaemia instead. RNAaemia was defined as a positive result for real-time RT-PCR in the plasma sample.\nDefinitions\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and shock were defined according to the interim guidance of WHO for novel coronavirus. Hypoxaemia was defined as arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) over inspiratory oxygen fraction (FIO2) of less than 300 mm Hg. Acute kidney injury was identified and classified on the basis of the highest serum creatinine level or urine output criteria according to the kidney disease improving global outcomes classification. Secondary infection was diagnosed if the patients had clinical symptoms or signs of nosocomial pneumonia or bacteraemia, and was combined with a positive culture of a new pathogen from a lower respiratory tract specimen (including the sputum, transtracheal aspirates, or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, or from blood samples taken &gt;=48 h after admission). Cardiac injury followed the definition used in our previous study in H7N9 patients. In brief, cardiac injury was diagnosed if serum levels of cardiac biomarkers (eg, troponin I) were above the 99th percentile upper reference limit, or new abnormalities were shown in electrocardiography and echocardiography.\nStatistical analysis\nContinuous variables were expressed as median (IQR) and compared with the Mann-Whitney U test; categorical variables were expressed as number (%) and compared by chi2 test or Fisher's exact test between ICU care and no ICU care groups. Boxplots were drawn to describe plasma cytokine and chemokine concentrations.\nA two-sided alpha of less than 0 05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were done using the SAS software, version 9.4, unless otherwise indicated.\nRole of the funding source\nThe funder of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. The corresponding authors had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.\nResults\nDate of illness onset and age distribution of patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection\n(A) Number of hospital admissions by age group. (B) Distribution of symptom onset date for laboratory-confirmed cases. The Wuhan local health authority issued an epidemiological alert on Dec 30, 2019, and closed the Huanan seafood market 2 days later.\nDemographics and baseline characteristics of patients infected with 2019-nCoV\n		All patients (n=41)	ICU care (n=13)	No ICU care (n=28)	p value	 	Characteristics	 	Age, years	49 0 (41 0-58 0)	49 0 (41 0-61 0)	49 0 (41 0-57 5)	0 60	 	Sex	..	..	..	0 24	 		Men	30 (73%)	11 (85%)	19 (68%)	..

ICU=intensive care unit.\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients were identified as laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection in Wuhan. 20 [49%]) of the 2019-nCoV-infected patients were aged 25-49 years, and 14 (34%) were aged 50-64 years (figure 1 A). The median age of the patients was 49 0 years (IQR 41 0-58 0; table 1 ). In our cohort of the first 41 patients as of Jan 2, no children or adolescents were infected. Of the 41 patients, 13 (32%) were admitted to the ICU because they required high-flow nasal cannula or higher-level oxygen support measures to correct hypoxaemia. Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%]); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n27 (66%) patients had direct exposure to Huanan seafood market (figure 1B). Market exposure was similar between the patients with ICU care (nine [69%]) and those with non-ICU care (18 [64%]). The symptom onset date of the first patient identified was Dec 1, 2019. None of his family members developed fever or any respiratory symptoms. No epidemiological link was found between the first patient and later cases. The first fatal case, who had continuous exposure to the market, was admitted to hospital because of a 7-day history of fever, cough, and dyspnoea. 5 days after illness onset, his wife, a 53-year-old woman who had no known history of exposure to the market, also presented with pneumonia and was hospitalised in the isolation ward.\nTimeline of 2019-nCoV cases after onset of illness\nThe most common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38; table 1). More than half of patients (22 [55%] of 40) developed dyspnoea. The median duration from illness onset to dyspnoea was 8 0 days (IQR 5 0-13 0). The median time from onset of symptoms to first hospital admission was 7 0 days (4 0-8 0), to shortness of breath was 8 0 days (5 0-13 0), to ARDS was 9 0 days (8 0-14 0), to mechanical ventilation was 10 5 days (7 0-14 0), and to ICU admission was 10 5 days (8 0-17 0; figure 2 ).\nLaboratory findings of patients infected with 2019-nCoV on admission to hospital\n		All patients (n=41)	ICU care (n=13)	No ICU care (n=28)	p value	 	White blood cell count, x 109/L	6 2 (4 1-10 5)	11 3 (5 8-12 1)	5 7 (3 1-7 6)	0 011	 		&lt;4	10/40 (25%)	1/13 (8%)	9/27 (33%)	0 041	 		4-10	18/40 (45%)	5/13 (38%)	13/27 (48%)	..	 		&gt;10	12/40 (30%)	7/13 (54%)	5/27 (19%)	..

ICU=intensive care unit.\nComplicated typical secondary infection during the first hospitalisation.\nThe blood counts of patients on admission showed leucopenia (white blood cell count less than 4 x 109/L; ten [25%] of 40 patients) and lymphopenia (lymphocyte count &lt;1 0 x 109/L; 26 [63%] patients; table 2 ). Prothrombin time and D-dimer level on admission were higher in ICU patients (median prothrombin time 12 2 s [IQR 11 2-13 4]; median D-dimer level 2 4 mg/L [0 6-14 4]) than non-ICU patients (median prothrombin time 10 7 s [9 8-12 1], p=0 012; median D-dimer level 0 5 mg/L [0 3-0 8], p=0 0042). Levels of aspartate aminotransferase were increased in 15 (37%) of 41 patients, including eight (62%) of 13 ICU patients and seven (25%) of 28 non-ICU patients. Hypersensitive troponin I (hs-cTnI) was increased substantially in five patients, in whom the diagnosis of virus-related cardiac injury was made.\nMost patients had normal serum levels of procalcitonin on admission (procalcitonin &lt;0 1 ng/mL; 27 [69%] patients; table 2). Four ICU patients developed secondary infections. Three of the four patients with secondary infection had procalcitonin greater than 0 5 ng/mL (0 69 ng/mL, 1 46 ng/mL, and 6 48 ng/mL).\nChest CT images\n(A) Transverse chest CT images from a 40-year-old man showing bilateral multiple lobular and subsegmental areas of consolidation on day 15 after symptom onset. Transverse chest CT images from a 53-year-old woman showing bilateral ground-glass opacity and subsegmental areas of consolidation on day 8 after symptom onset (B), and bilateral ground-glass opacity on day 12 after symptom onset (C).\nOn admission, abnormalities in chest CT images were detected among all patients. Of the 41 patients, 40 (98%) had bilateral involvement (table 2). The typical findings of chest CT images of ICU patients on admission were bilateral multiple lobular and subsegmental areas of consolidation (figure 3 A). The representative chest CT findings of non-ICU patients showed bilateral ground-glass opacity and subsegmental areas of consolidation (figure 3B). Later chest CT images showed bilateral ground-glass opacity, whereas the consolidation had been resolved (figure 3C).\nInitial plasma IL1B, IL1RA, IL7, IL8, IL9, IL10, basic FGF, GCSF, GMCSF, IFNgamma, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, MIP1B, PDGF, TNFalpha, and VEGF concentrations were higher in both ICU patients and non-ICU patients than in healthy adults (appendix pp 6-7). Plasma levels of IL5, IL12p70, IL15, Eotaxin, and RANTES were similar between healthy adults and patients infected with 2019-nCoV. Further comparison between ICU and non-ICU patients showed that plasma concentrations of IL2, IL7, IL10, GCSF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNFalpha were higher in ICU patients than non-ICU patients.\nTreatments and outcomes of patients infected with 2019-nCoV\n		All patients (n=41)	ICU care (n=13)	No ICU care (n=28)	p value	 	Duration from illness onset to first admission	7 0 (4 0-8 0)	7 0 (4 0-8 0)	7 0 (4 0-8 5)	0 87	 	Complications	 		Acute respiratory distress syndrome	12 (29%)	11 (85%)	1 (4%)	&lt;0 0001	 		RNAaemia	6 (15%)	2 (15%)	4 (14%)	0 93	 		Cycle threshold of RNAaemia	35 1 (34 7-35 1)	35 1 (35 1-35 1)	34 8 (34 1-35 4)	0 35	 		Acute cardiac injury*	5 (12%)	4 (31%)	1 (4%)	0 017	 		Acute kidney injury	3 (7%)	3 (23%)	0	0 027	 		Secondary infection	4 (10%)	4 (31%)	0	0 0014	 		Shock	3 (7%)	3 (23%)	0	0 027	 	Treatment	 		Antiviral therapy	38 (93%)	12 (92%)	26 (93%)	0 46	 		Antibiotic therapy	41 (100%)	13 (100%)	28 (100%)	NA	 		Use of corticosteroid	9 (22%)	6 (46%)	3 (11%)	0 013	 	Continuous renal replacement therapy	3 (7%)	3 (23%)	0	0 027	 	Oxygen support	..	..	..	&lt;0 0001	 		Nasal cannula	27 (66%)	1 (8%)	26 (93%)	..

ECMO=extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.\nDefined as blood levels of hypersensitive troponin I above the 99th percentile upper reference limit (&gt;28 pg/mL) or new abnormalities shown on electrocardiography and echocardiography.\nAll patients had pneumonia. Common complications included ARDS (12 [29%] of 41 patients), followed by RNAaemia (six [15%] patients), acute cardiac injury (five [12%] patients), and secondary infection (four [10%] patients; table 3 ). Invasive mechanical ventilation was required in four (10%) patients, with two of them (5%) had refractory hypoxaemia and received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation as salvage therapy. All patients were administered with empirical antibiotic treatment, and 38 (93%) patients received antiviral therapy (oseltamivir). Additionally, nine (22%) patients were given systematic corticosteroids. A comparison of clinical features between patients who received and did not receive systematic corticosteroids is in the appendix (pp 1-5).\nAs of Jan 22, 2020, 28 (68%) of 41 patients have been discharged and six (15%) patients have died. Fitness for discharge was based on abatement of fever for at least 10 days, with improvement of chest radiographic evidence and viral clearance in respiratory samples from upper respiratory tract.\nDiscussion\nWe report here a cohort of 41 patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection. Patients had serious, sometimes fatal, pneumonia and were admitted to the designated hospital in Wuhan, China, by Jan 2, 2020. Clinical presentations greatly resemble SARS-CoV. Patients with severe illness developed ARDS and required ICU admission and oxygen therapy. The time between hospital admission and ARDS was as short as 2 days. At this stage, the mortality rate is high for 2019-nCoV, because six (15%) of 41 patients in this cohort died.\nThe number of deaths is rising quickly. As of Jan 24, 2020, 835 laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infections were reported in China, with 25 fatal cases. Reports have been released of exported cases in many provinces in China, and in other countries; some health-care workers have also been infected in Wuhan. Taken together, evidence so far indicates human transmission for 2019-nCoV. We are concerned that 2019-nCoV could have acquired the ability for efficient human transmission. Airborne precautions, such as a fit-tested N95 respirator, and other personal protective equipment are strongly recommended. To prevent further spread of the disease in health-care settings that are caring for patients infected with 2019-nCoV, onset of fever and respiratory symptoms should be closely monitored among health-care workers. Testing of respiratory specimens should be done immediately once a diagnosis is suspected. Serum antibodies should be tested among health-care workers before and after their exposure to 2019-nCoV for identification of asymptomatic infections.\nSimilarities of clinical features between 2019-nCoV and previous betacoronavirus infections have been noted. In this cohort, most patients presented with fever, dry cough, dyspnoea, and bilateral ground-glass opacities on chest CT scans. These features of 2019-nCoV infection bear some resemblance to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections. However, few patients with 2019-nCoV infection had prominent upper respiratory tract signs and symptoms (eg, rhinorrhoea, sneezing, or sore throat), indicating that the target cells might be located in the lower airway. Furthermore, 2019-nCoV patients rarely developed intestinal signs and symptoms (eg, diarrhoea), whereas about 20-25% of patients with MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV infection had diarrhoea. Faecal and urine samples should be tested to exclude a potential alternative route of transmission that is unknown at this stage.\nThe pathophysiology of unusually high pathogenicity for SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV has not been completely understood. Early studies have shown that increased amounts of proinflammatory cytokines in serum (eg, IL1B, IL6, IL12, IFNgamma, IP10, and MCP1) were associated with pulmonary inflammation and extensive lung damage in SARS patients. MERS-CoV infection was also reported to induce increased concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines (IFNgamma, TNFalpha, IL15, and IL17). We noted that patients infected with 2019-nCoV also had high amounts of IL1B, IFNgamma, IP10, and MCP1, probably leading to activated T-helper-1 (Th1) cell responses. Moreover, patients requiring ICU admission had higher concentrations of GCSF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNFalpha than did those not requiring ICU admission, suggesting that the cytokine storm was associated with disease severity. However, 2019-nCoV infection also initiated increased secretion of T-helper-2 (Th2) cytokines (eg, IL4 and IL10) that suppress inflammation, which differs from SARS-CoV infection. Further studies are necessary to characterise the Th1 and Th2 responses in 2019-nCoV infection and to elucidate the pathogenesis. Autopsy or biopsy studies would be the key to understand the disease.\nIn view of the high amount of cytokines induced by SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and 2019-nCoV infections, corticosteroids were used frequently for treatment of patients with severe illness, for possible benefit by reducing inflammatory-induced lung injury. However, current evidence in patients with SARS and MERS suggests that receiving corticosteroids did not have an effect on mortality, but rather delayed viral clearance. Therefore, corticosteroids should not be routinely given systemically, according to WHO interim guidance. Among our cohort of 41 laboratory-confirmed patients with 2019-nCoV infection, corticosteroids were given to very few non-ICU cases, and low-to-moderate dose of corticosteroids were given to less than half of severely ill patients with ARDS. Further evidence is urgently needed to assess whether systematic corticosteroid treatment is beneficial or harmful for patients infected with 2019-nCoV.\nNo antiviral treatment for coronavirus infection has been proven to be effective. In a historical control study, the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir among SARS-CoV patients was associated with substantial clinical benefit (fewer adverse clinical outcomes). Arabi and colleagues initiated a placebo-controlled trial of interferon beta-1b, lopinavir, and ritonavir among patients with MERS infection in Saudi Arabia. Preclinical evidence showed the potent efficacy of remdesivir (a broad-spectrum antiviral nucleotide prodrug) to treat MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infections. As 2019-nCoV is an emerging virus, an effective treatment has not been developed for disease resulting from this virus. Since the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir was already available in the designated hospital, a randomised controlled trial has been initiated quickly to assess the efficacy and safety of combined use of lopinavir and ritonavir in patients hospitalised with 2019-nCoV infection.\nOur study has some limitations. First, for most of the 41 patients, the diagnosis was confirmed with lower respiratory tract specimens and no paired nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained to investigate the difference in the viral RNA detection rate between upper and lower respiratory tract specimens. Serological detection was not done to look for 2019-nCoV antibody rises in 18 patients with undetectable viral RNA. Second, with the limited number of cases, it is difficult to assess host risk factors for disease severity and mortality with multivariable-adjusted methods. This is a modest-sized case series of patients admitted to hospital; collection of standardised data for a larger cohort would help to further define the clinical presentation, natural history, and risk factors. Further studies in outpatient, primary care, or community settings are needed to get a full picture of the spectrum of clinical severity. At the same time, finding of statistical tests and p values should be interpreted with caution, and non-significant p values do not necessarily rule out difference between ICU and non-ICU patients. Third, since the causative pathogen has just been identified, kinetics of viral load and antibody titres were not available. Finally, the potential exposure bias in our study might account for why no paediatric or adolescent patients were reported in this cohort. More effort should be made to answer these questions in future studies.\nBoth SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were believed to originate in bats, and these infections were transmitted directly to humans from market civets and dromedary camels, respectively. Extensive research on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV has driven the discovery of many SARS-like and MERS-like coronaviruses in bats. In 2013, Ge and colleagues reported the whole genome sequence of a SARS-like coronavirus in bats with that ability to use human ACE2 as a receptor, thus having replication potentials in human cells. 2019-nCoV still needs to be studied deeply in case it becomes a global health threat. Reliable quick pathogen tests and feasible differential diagnosis based on clinical description are crucial for clinicians in their first contact with suspected patients. Because of the pandemic potential of 2019-nCoV, careful surveillance is essential to monitor its future host adaption, viral evolution, infectivity, transmissibility, and pathogenicity.\n This online publication has been corrected.

for COVID-19: A systematic review of nurses’ experiences of working in acute care hospital settings during a respiratory pandemic","abstract":"Background\nPandemics and epidemics are public health emergencies that can result in substantial deaths and socio-economic disruption.\n\n Nurses play a key role in the public health response to such crises, delivering direct patient care and reducing the risk of exposure to the infectious disease.\n\n The experience of providing nursing care in this context has the potential to have significant short and long term consequences for individual nurses, society and the nursing profession.\n\n\nObjectives\nTo synthesize and present the best available evidence on the experiences of nurses working in acute hospital settings during a pandemic.\n\n\nDesign\nThis review was conducted using the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for systematic reviews.\n\n\nData sources\nA structured search using CINAHL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, MedNar, ProQuest and Index to Theses was conducted.\n\n\nReview methods\nAll studies describing nurses’ experiences were included regardless of methodology.\n\n Themes and narrative statements were extracted from included papers using the SUMARI data extraction tool from Joanna Briggs Institute.\n\n\nResults\nThirteen qualitative studies were included in the review.\n\n The experiences of 348 nurses generated a total of 116 findings, which formed seven categories based on similarity of meaning.\n\n Three synthesized findings were generated from the categories: (i) Supportive nursing teams providing quality care; (ii) Acknowledging the physical and emotional impact; and (iii) Responsiveness of systematised organizational reaction.\n\n\nConclusions\nNurses are pivotal to the health care response to infectious disease pandemics and epidemics.\n\n This systematic review emphasises that nurses’ require Governments, policy makers and nursing groups to actively engage in supporting nurses, both during and following a pandemic or epidemic.\n\n Without this, nurses are likely to experience substantial psychological issues that can lead to burnout and loss from the nursing workforce.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7206441","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

Wuhan, China.\n\n\nMethods\nA large-scale cross-sectional, descriptive, correlational study design was used.\n\n A total of 2,014 eligible frontline nurses from two hospitals in Wuhan, China, participated in the study.\n\n Besides sociodemographic and background data, a set of valid and reliable instruments were used to measure outcomes of burnout, anxiety, depression, fear, skin lesion, self-efficacy, resilience, and social support via the online survey in February 2020.\nFindings\nOn average, the participants had a moderate level of burnout and a high level of fear.\n\n About half

the daily lives of community?dwelling older persons.\n\n\nDesign\nA qualitative descriptive study design was used.\n\n\nMethods\nSix focus groups were conducted with a total of 32 older persons between February–August 2016. Data analysis followed the Qualitative Analysis Guide of Leuven.\n\n\nResults\nThe participants described the use or non?use of PSADs as a decision resulting from a “legitimation process”.\n\n This process implies that a person needs to perceive the necessity for a PSAD and then determine the right moment at which to start using it.\n\n During this process, each person weighs her or his “ageing self” and “perception of technology” then decides whether to start using a device or to delay its use.\n\n “Critical events” initiate this process, compelling the person to consider their own safety and their possible need for assistance.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe legitimation process suggests that the initiation of PSAD use represents a turning point in life.\n\n Using a PSAD is not simply a matter of obtaining one.\n\n It is a complex decision?making process establishing legitimation for its use, which is interwoven with one's individual ageing, self?perception, and the meaning attributed to the device.\n\n\nImpact\nOlder persons need to be supported; in particular, they require time to go through the legitimation process for PSAD use.\n\n Nurses can empower them in this process, such that they perceive using a PSAD as a means to restore their frailty balance and feel enabled to (re)gain control over their own life and thus to preserve their independence.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7756415","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley and Sons Inc.","authors":[{"firstname":"Friederike J.

Understanding the early transmission dynamics of the infection and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures is crucial for assessing the potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas.\n\n Combining a mathematical model of severe SARS-CoV-2 transmission with four datasets from within and outside Wuhan, we estimated how transmission in Wuhan varied between December, 2019, and February, 2020. We used these estimates to assess the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission to occur in locations outside Wuhan if cases were introduced.\n\n\nMethods\nWe combined a stochastic transmission model with data on cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan and international cases that originated in Wuhan to estimate how transmission had varied over time during January, 2020, and February, 2020. Based on these estimates, we then calculated the probability that newly introduced cases might generate outbreaks in other areas.\n\n To estimate the early dynamics of transmission in Wuhan, we fitted a stochastic transmission dynamic model to multiple publicly available datasets on cases in Wuhan and internationally exported cases from Wuhan.\n\n The four datasets we fitted to were: daily number of new internationally exported cases (or lack thereof), by date of onset, as of Jan 26, 2020; daily number of new cases in Wuhan with no market exposure, by date of onset, between Dec 1, 2019, and Jan 1, 2020; daily number of new cases in China, by date of onset, between Dec 29, 2019, and Jan 23, 2020; and proportion of infected passengers on evacuation flights between Jan 29, 2020, and Feb 4, 2020. We used an additional two datasets for comparison with model outputs: daily number of new exported cases from Wuhan (or lack thereof) in countries with high connectivity to Wuhan (ie, top 20 most at-risk countries), by date of confirmation, as of Feb 10, 2020; and data on new confirmed cases reported in Wuhan between Jan 16, 2020, and Feb 11, 2020.\nFindings\nWe estimated that the median daily reproduction number (Rt) in Wuhan declined from 2·35 (95% CI 1·15–4·77) 1 week before travel restrictions were introduced on Jan 23, 2020, to 1·05 (0·41–2·39) 1 week after.\n\n Based on our estimates of Rt, assuming SARS-like variation, we calculated that in locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan in early January, once there are at least four independently introduced cases, there is a more than 50% chance the infection will establish within that population.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur results show that COVID-19 transmission probably declined in Wuhan during late January, 2020, coinciding with the introduction of travel control measures.\n\n As more cases arrive in international locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan before these control measures, it is likely many chains of transmission will fail to establish initially, but might lead to new outbreaks eventually.\n\n\nFunding\nWellcome Trust, Health Data Research UK, Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, and National Institute for Health Research.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7158569","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Science ;, The Lancet Pub.

the USA: a mathematical modelling study","abstract":"Background\nWithin 4 months of COVID-19 first being reported in the USA, it spread to every state and to more than 90% of all counties.\n\n During this period, the US COVID-19 response was highly decentralised, with stay-at-home directives issued by state and local officials, subject to varying levels of enforcement.\n\n The absence of a centralised policy and timeline combined with the complex dynamics of human mobility and the variable intensity of local outbreaks makes assessing the effect of large-scale social distancing on COVID-19 transmission in the USA a challenge.\n\n\nMethods\nWe used daily mobility data derived from aggregated and anonymised cell (mobile) phone data, provided by Teralytics (Zürich, Switzerland) from Jan 1 to April 20, 2020, to capture real-time trends in movement patterns for each US county, and used these data to generate a social distancing metric.\n\n We used epidemiological data to compute the COVID-19 growth rate ratio for a given county on a given day.\n\n Using these metrics, we evaluated how social distancing, measured by the relative change in mobility, affected the rate of new infections in the 25 counties in the USA with the highest number of confirmed cases on April 16, 2020, by fitting a statistical model for each county.\n\n\nFindings\nOur analysis revealed that mobility patterns are strongly correlated with decreased COVID-19 case growth rates for the most affected counties in the USA, with Pearson correlation coefficients above 0·7 for 20 of the 25 counties evaluated.\n\n Additionally, the effect of changes in mobility patterns, which dropped by 35–63% relative to the normal conditions, on COVID-19 transmission are not likely to be perceptible for 9–12 days, and potentially up to 3 weeks, which is consistent with the incubation time of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 plus additional time for reporting.\n\n We also show evidence that behavioural changes were already underway in many US counties days to weeks before state-level or local-level stay-at-home policies were implemented, implying that individuals anticipated public health directives where social distancing was adopted, despite a mixed political message.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThis study strongly supports a role of social distancing as an effective way to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in the USA.\n\n Until a COVID-19 vaccine is widely available, social distancing will remain one of the primary measures to combat disease spread, and these findings should serve to support more timely policy making around social distancing in the USA in the future.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7329287","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

concepts.\n We take advantage of the relationship between network theory and the field of microarray data analysis to clarify the meaning of and the relationship among network concepts in gene coexpression networks.\n Network theory offers a wealth of intuitive concepts for describing the pairwise relationships among genes, which are depicted in cluster trees and heat maps.\n Conversely, microarray data analysis techniques (singular value decomposition, tests of differential expression) can also be used to address difficult problems in network theory.\n We describe conditions when a close relationship exists between network analysis and microarray data analysis techniques, and provide a rough dictionary for translating between the two fields.\n Using the angular interpretation of correlations, we provide a geometric interpretation of network theoretic concepts and derive unexpected relationships among them.\n We use the singular value decomposition of module expression data to characterize approximately factorizable gene coexpression networks, i.\ne.\n, adjacency matrices that factor into node specific contributions.\n High and low level views of coexpression networks allow us to study the relationships among modules and among module genes, respectively.\n We characterize coexpression networks where hub genes are significant with respect to a microarray sample trait and show that the network concept of intramodular connectivity can be interpreted as a fuzzy measure of module membership.\n We illustrate our results using human, mouse, and yeast microarray gene

an Initial Outbreak Hospital in Korea","abstract":"In this study, the results of an airflow investigation conducted on 7 June 2015 as part of a series of epidemiologic investigations at Pyeongtaek St.\n Mary’s Hospital, South Korea, were investigated.\n The study involved 38 individuals who were infected directly and indirectly with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), by a super-spreader patient.\n Tracer gas experiments conducted on the eighth floor, where the initial patient was hospitalized, confirmed that the tracer gas spread to adjacent patient rooms and rooms across corridors.\n In particular, the experiment with an external wind direction and speed similar to those during the hospitalization of the initial patient revealed that the air change rate was 17–20 air changes per hour (ACH), with air introduced through the window in the room of the infected patient (room 8104).\n The tracer gas concentration of room 8110, which was the farthest room, was 7.56% of room 8104, indicating that a high concentration of gas has spread from room 8104 to rooms across the corridor.\n In contrast, the tracer gas was barely detected in a maternity ward to the south of room 8104, where there was no secondary infected patient.\n Moreover, MERS is known to spread mainly by droplets through close contact, but long-distance dispersion is probable in certain environments, such as that of a super-spreader patient hospitalized in a room without ventilation, hospitals with a central corridor type, and indoor airflow dispersion due to external wind.\n","id":"PMC6313554","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"Minki","surname":"Sung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Seongmin","surname":"Jo","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Seongmin","surname":"Jo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sang-Eun","surname":"Lee","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Moran","surname":"Ki","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo

transmission routes must be identified.\n In this study, the possibility of MERS spreading through airflow was investigated on the eighth floor of Pyeongtaek St Mary's Hospital.\n Computational fluid dynamics was used to analyse the indoor airflow and passive tracer diffusion during the index patient's stay.\n Six cases were simulated for different outdoor wind directions and indoor mechanical ventilation operations.\n When a passive tracer was released in ward 8104, where the index patient was hospitalized, the passive tracer spread through the indoor airflow, which was created by the outdoor airflow.\n Ward 8109, which had the largest number of infected cases and was far distant from ward 8104, showed passive tracer concentration in all cases.\n This result indicates that MERS may have spread through airflow.\n The study results do not imply that the infection pathway of MERS is airborne.\n However, the results show the possibility of MERS spreading through airflow in specific environments such as poor ventilation environments.\n","id":"PMC6458380","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"The Royal

identified in South Korea, and attempts have been made to isolate the pathogen from these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nUpper and lower respiratory tract secretion samples from putative patients with COVID-19 were inoculated onto cells to isolate the virus.\n\n Full genome sequencing and electron microscopy were used to identify the virus.\n\n\nResults\nThe virus replicated in Vero cells and cytopathic effects were observed.\n\n Full genome sequencing showed that the virus genome exhibited sequence homology of more than 99.9% with SARS-CoV-2 which was isolated from patients from other countries, for instance China.\n\n Sequence homology of SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV was 77.5% and 50%, respectively.\n\n Coronavirus-specific morphology was observed by electron microscopy

are large, enveloped RNA viruses of both medical and veterinary importance.\n Interest in this viral family has intensified in the past few years as a result of the identification of a newly emerged coronavirus as the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).\n At the molecular level, coronaviruses employ a variety of unusual strategies to accomplish a complex program of gene expression.\n Coronavirus replication entails ribosome frameshifting during genome translation, the synthesis of both genomic and multiple subgenomic RNA species, and the assembly of progeny virions by a pathway that is unique among enveloped RNA viruses.\n Progress in the investigation of these processes has been enhanced by the development of reverse genetic systems, an advance that was heretofore obstructed by the enormous size of the coronavirus genome.\n This review summarizes both classical and contemporary discoveries in the study of the molecular biology of these infectious agents, with particular emphasis on the nature and recognition of viral receptors, viral RNA synthesis, and the molecular interactions governing virion

(TGF-?)-induced expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 but attenuates Smad3/Smad4-mediated apoptosis of human peripheral lung epithelial HPL1 cells.\n The promoting effect of N protein on the transcriptional responses of TGF-? is Smad3-specific.\n N protein associates with Smad3 and promotes Smad3-p300 complex formation while it interferes with the complex formation between Smad3 and Smad4. These findings provide evidence of a novel mechanism whereby N protein modulates TGF-? signaling to block apoptosis of SARS-CoV-infected host cells and meanwhile promote tissue fibrosis.\n Our results reveal a novel mode of Smad3 action in a Smad4-independent manner and may lead to successful strategies for SARS treatment by targeting the TGF-? signaling molecules.\n","id":"PMC8740907","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"ASBMB.

These genes differ distinctly among the three coronavirus groups and are specific for each group.\n While the essential genes encode replication and structural functions, hardly anything is known about the products and functions of the group-specific genes.\n As a first step to elucidate their significance, we deleted the group-specific genes from the group 2 mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) genome via a novel targeted recombination system based on host switching (L.\n Kuo, G.\n J.\nGodeke, M.\n J.\n Raamsman, P.\n S.\n Masters, and P.\n J.\n M.\n Rottier, 2000, J.\n Virol.\n 74, 1393–1406).\n Thus, we obtained recombinant viruses from which the two clusters of group-specific genes were deleted either separately or in combination in a controlled genetic background.\n As all recombinant deletion mutant viruses appeared to be viable, we conclude that the MHV group-specific genes are nonessential, accessory genes.\n Importantly, all deletion mutant viruses were attenuated when inoculated into their natural host, the mouse.\n Therefore, deletion of the coronavirus group-specific genes seems to provide an attractive approach to generate attenuated live coronavirus

coronavirus (SARS-CoV) were predicted using recently published genome sequences.\n Fourteen putative open reading frames were identified, 12 of which were predicted to be expressed from a nested set of eight subgenomic mRNAs.\n The synthesis of these mRNAs in SARS-CoV-infected cells was confirmed experimentally.\n The 4382- and 7073 amino acid residue SARS-CoV replicase polyproteins are predicted to be cleaved into 16 subunits by two viral proteinases (bringing the total number of SARS-CoV proteins to 28).\n A phylogenetic analysis of the replicase gene, using a distantly related torovirus as an outgroup, demonstrated that, despite a number of unique features, SARS-CoV is most closely related to group 2 coronaviruses.\n Distant homologs of cellular RNA processing enzymes were identified in group 2 coronaviruses, with four of them being conserved in SARS-CoV.\n These newly recognized viral enzymes place the mechanism of coronavirus RNA synthesis in a completely new perspective.\n Furthermore, together with previously described viral enzymes, they will be important targets for the design of antiviral strategies aimed at controlling the further spread of SARS-CoV.\n","id":"PMC7159028","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Eric

Efficacy in Senescent Mice Challenged with Recombinant SARS-CoV Bearing Epidemic and Zoonotic Spike Variants ","abstract":"Background\nIn 2003, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identified as the etiological agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome, a disease characterized by severe pneumonia that sometimes results in death.\n\n SARS-CoV is a zoonotic virus that crossed the species barrier, most likely originating from bats or from other species including civets, raccoon dogs, domestic cats, swine, and rodents.\n\n A SARS-CoV vaccine should confer long-term protection, especially in vulnerable senescent populations, against both the 2003 epidemic strains and zoonotic strains that may yet emerge from animal reservoirs.\n\n We report the comprehensive investigation of SARS vaccine efficacy in young and senescent mice following homologous and heterologous challenge.\n\n\nMethods and Findings\nUsing Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicon particles (VRP) expressing the 2003 epidemic Urbani SARS-CoV strain spike (S) glycoprotein (VRP-S) or the nucleocapsid (N) protein from the same strain (VRP-N), we demonstrate that VRP-S, but not VRP-N vaccines provide complete short- and long-term protection against homologous strain challenge in young and senescent mice.\n\n To test VRP vaccine efficacy against a heterologous SARS-CoV, we used phylogenetic analyses, synthetic biology, and reverse genetics to construct a chimeric virus (icGDO3-S) encoding a synthetic S glycoprotein gene of the most genetically divergent human strain, GDO3, which clusters among the zoonotic SARS-CoV.\n\n icGD03-S replicated efficiently in human airway epithelial cells and in the lungs of young and senescent mice, and was highly resistant to neutralization with antisera directed against the Urbani strain.\n\n Although VRP-S vaccines provided complete short-term protection against heterologous icGD03-S challenge in young mice, only limited protection was seen in vaccinated senescent animals.\n\n VRP-N vaccines not only failed to protect from homologous or heterologous challenge, but resulted in enhanced immunopathology with eosinophilic infiltrates within the lungs of SARS-CoV–challenged mice.\n\n VRP-N–induced pathology presented at day 4, peaked around day 7, and persisted through day 14, and was likely mediated by cellular immune responses.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis study identifies gaps and challenges in vaccine design for controlling future SARS-CoV zoonosis, especially in vulnerable elderly populations.\n\n The availability of a SARS-CoV virus bearing heterologous S glycoproteins provides a robust challenge inoculum for evaluating vaccine efficacy against zoonotic strains, the most likely source of future outbreaks.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1716185","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

Mouse-Adapted SARS-Coronavirus Causes Disease and Mortality in BALB/c Mice","abstract":"No single animal model for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) reproduces all aspects of the human disease.\n Young inbred mice support SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) replication in the respiratory tract and are available in sufficient numbers for statistical evaluation.\n They are relatively inexpensive and easily accessible, but their use in SARS research is limited because they do not develop illness following infection.\n Older (12- to 14-mo-old) BALB/c mice develop clinical illness and pneumonitis, but they can be hard to procure, and immune senescence complicates pathogenesis studies.\n We adapted the SARS-CoV (Urbani strain) by serial passage in the respiratory tract of young BALB/c mice.\n Fifteen passages resulted in a virus (MA15) that is lethal for mice following intranasal inoculation.\n Lethality is preceded by rapid and high titer viral replication in lungs, viremia, and dissemination of virus to extrapulmonary sites accompanied by lymphopenia, neutrophilia, and pathological changes in the lungs.\n Abundant viral antigen is extensively distributed in bronchial epithelial cells and alveolar pneumocytes, and necrotic cellular debris is present in airways and alveoli, with only mild and focal pneumonitis.\n These observations suggest that mice infected with MA15 die from an overwhelming viral infection with extensive, virally mediated destruction of pneumocytes and ciliated epithelial cells.\n The MA15 virus has six coding mutations associated with adaptation and increased virulence; when introduced into a recombinant SARS-CoV, these mutations result in a highly virulent and lethal virus (rMA15), duplicating the phenotype of the biologically derived MA15 virus.\n Intranasal inoculation with MA15 reproduces many aspects of disease seen in severe human cases of SARS.\n The availability of the MA15 virus will enhance the use of the mouse model for SARS because infection with MA15 causes morbidity, mortality, and pulmonary pathology.\n This virus will be of value as a stringent challenge in evaluation of the efficacy of vaccines and antivirals.\n","id":"PMC1769406","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

respiratory disease, SARS, with significant mortality.\n Although factors contributing to the highly pathogenic nature of SARS-CoV remain poorly understood, it has been reported that SARS-CoV infection does not induce type I interferons (IFNs) in cell culture.\n However, it is uncertain whether SARS-CoV evades host detection or has evolved mechanisms to counteract innate host defenses.\n We show here that infection of SARS-CoV triggers a weak IFN response in cultured human lung/bronchial epithelial cells without inducing the phosphorylation of IFN-regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), a latent cellular transcription factor that is pivotal for type I IFN synthesis.\n Furthermore, SARS-CoV infection blocked the induction of IFN antiviral activity and the up-regulation of protein expression of a subset of IFN-stimulated genes triggered by double-stranded RNA or an unrelated paramyxovirus.\n In searching for a SARS-CoV protein capable of counteracting innate immunity, we identified the papain-like protease (PLpro) domain as a potent IFN antagonist.\n The inhibition of the IFN response does not require the protease activity of PLpro.\n Rather, PLpro interacts with IRF-3 and inhibits the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF-3, thereby disrupting the activation of type I IFN responses through either Toll-like receptor 3 or retinoic acid-inducible gene I/melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 pathways.\n Our data suggest that regulation of IRF-3-dependent innate antiviral defenses by PLpro may contribute to the establishment of SARS-CoV

Distinct glial cell cytokine and chemokine response patterns were observed within 3 days after infection, became progressively more polarized during the course of infection and with the infiltration of leukocytes.\n In the brain, MHV-JHM infection induced strong accumulation of IFN? mRNA relative to IFN? mRNA.\n This trend was reversed in MHV-A59 infection and was accompanied by increased CD8 T cell infiltration into brain compared to MHV-JHM infection.\n Increased apoptosis appeared to contribute to the diminished presence of CD8 T cells in MHV-JHM-infected brain with the consequence of a lower potential for IFN? production and antiviral activity.\n MHV-JHM infection also induced sustained mRNA accumulation of the innate immune response products interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1. Furthermore, high levels of macrophage-inflammatory protein (MIP)-1?, MIP-1?, and MIP-2 mRNA were observed at the onset of MHV-JHM infection and correlated with a marked elevation in the number of

stimulation of various cytokine and chemokine genes, including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and IP-10, which corresponds to the host response seen in acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n As opposed to many in vitro experiments, SARS-CoV induced a wide range of type I interferons (IFNs) and nuclear translocation of phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 in the lungs of macaques.\n Using immunohistochemistry, we revealed that these antiviral signaling pathways were differentially regulated in distinctive subsets of cells.\n Our studies emphasize that the induction of early IFN signaling may be critical to confer protection against SARS-CoV infection and highlight the strength of combining functional genomics with immunohistochemistry to further unravel the

Effects","abstract":"Background\nThe SARS outbreak of 2002–2003 presented clinicians with a new, life-threatening disease for which they had no experience in treating and no research on the effectiveness of treatment options.\n\n The World Health Organization (WHO) expert panel on SARS treatment requested a systematic review and comprehensive summary of treatments used for SARS-infected patients in order to guide future treatment and identify priorities for research.\n\n\nMethods and Findings\nIn response to the WHO request we conducted a systematic review of the published literature on ribavirin, corticosteroids, lopinavir and ritonavir (LPV/r), type I interferon (IFN), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and SARS convalescent plasma from both in vitro studies and in SARS patients.\n\n We also searched for clinical trial evidence of treatment for acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n Sources of data were the literature databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) up to February 2005. Data from publications were extracted and evidence within studies was classified using predefined criteria.\n\n In total, 54 SARS treatment studies, 15 in vitro studies, and three acute respiratory distress syndrome studies met our inclusion criteria.\n\n Within in vitro studies, ribavirin, lopinavir, and type I IFN showed inhibition of SARS-CoV in tissue culture.\n\n In SARS-infected patient reports on ribavirin, 26 studies were classified as inconclusive, and four showed possible harm.\n\n Seven studies of convalescent plasma or IVIG, three of IFN type I, and two of LPV/r were inconclusive.\n\n In 29 studies of steroid use, 25 were inconclusive and four were classified as causing possible harm.\n\n\nConclusions\nDespite an extensive literature reporting on SARS treatments, it was not possible to determine whether treatments benefited patients during the SARS outbreak.\n\n Some may have been harmful.\n\n Clinical trials should be designed to validate a standard protocol for dosage and timing, and to accrue data in real time during future outbreaks to monitor specific adverse effects and help inform treatment.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1564166","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Lauren

acute respiratory infection in the Arabian Peninsula, Tunisia, Morocco, France, Italy, Germany, and the UK.\n\n We provide a full description of a fatal case of MERS-CoV infection and associated phylogenetic analyses.\n\n\nMethods\nWe report data for a patient who was admitted to the Klinikum Schwabing (Munich, Germany) for severe acute respiratory infection.\n\n We did diagnostic RT-PCR and indirect immunofluorescence.\n\n From time of diagnosis, respiratory, faecal, and urine samples were obtained for virus quantification.\n\n We constructed a maximum likelihood tree of the five available complete MERS-CoV genomes.\n\n\nFindings\nA 73-year-old man from Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, was transferred to Klinikum Schwabing on March 19, 2013, on day 11 of illness.\n\n He had been diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 2008, and had received several lines of treatment.\n\n The patient died on day 18, due to septic shock.\n\n MERS-CoV was detected in two samples of bronchoalveolar fluid.\n\n Viral loads were highest in samples from the lower respiratory tract (up to 1·2?×?106 copies per mL).\n\n Maximum virus concentration in urine samples was 2691 RNA copies per mL on day 13; the virus was not present in the urine after renal failure on day 14. Stool samples obtained on days 12 and 16 contained the virus, with up to 1031 RNA copies per g (close to the lowest detection limit of the assay).\n\n One of two oronasal swabs obtained on day 16 were positive, but yielded little viral RNA (5370 copies per mL).\n\n No virus was detected in blood.\n\n The full virus genome was combined with four other available full genome sequences in a maximum likelihood phylogeny, correlating branch lengths with dates of isolation.\n\n The time of the common ancestor was halfway through 2011. Addition of novel genome data from an unlinked case treated 6 months previously in Essen, Germany, showed a clustering of viruses derived from Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.\n\n\nInterpretation\nWe have provided the first complete viral load profile in a case of MERS-CoV infection.\n\n MERS-CoV might have shedding patterns that are different from those of severe acute respiratory syndrome and so might need alternative diagnostic approaches.\n\n\nFunding\nEuropean Union; German Centre for Infection Research; German Research Council; and German Ministry for

coronavirus: estimation of pandemic risk","abstract":"Background\nThe new Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection shares many clinical, epidemiological, and virological similarities with that of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV.\n\n We aimed to estimate virus transmissibility and the epidemic potential of MERS-CoV, and to compare the results with similar findings obtained for prepandemic SARS.\n\n\nMethods\nWe retrieved data for MERS-CoV clusters from the WHO summary and subsequent reports, and published descriptions of cases, and took into account 55 of the 64 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV reported as of June 21, 2013, excluding cases notified in the previous 2 weeks.\n\n To assess the interhuman transmissibility of MERS-CoV, we used Bayesian analysis to estimate the basic reproduction number (R0) and compared it to that of prepandemic SARS.\n\n We considered two scenarios, depending on the interpretation of the MERS-CoV cluster-size data.\n\n\nResults\nWith our most pessimistic scenario (scenario 2), we estimated MERS-CoV R0 to be 0·69 (95% CI 0·50–0·92); by contrast, the R0 for prepandemic SARS-CoV was 0·80 (0·54–1·13).\n\n Our optimistic scenario (scenario 1) yielded a MERS-CoV R0 of 0·60 (0·42–0·80).\n\n Because of recent implementation of effective contact tracing and isolation procedures, further MERS-CoV transmission data might no longer describe an entire cluster, but only secondary infections directly caused by the index patient.\n\n Hence, we calculated that, under scenario 2, eight or more secondary infections caused by the next index patient would translate into a 5% or higher chance that the revised MERS-CoV R0 would exceed 1—ie, that MERS-CoV might have pandemic potential.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur analysis suggests that MERS-CoV does not yet have pandemic potential.\n\n We recommend enhanced surveillance, active contact tracing, and vigorous searches for the MERS-CoV animal hosts and transmission routes to human beings.\n\n\nFunding\nAgence Nationale de la Recherche (Labex Integrative Biology of Emerging Infectious Diseases), and the European Community's

We report detailed clinical and virological data for two related cases of MERS-CoV disease, after nosocomial transmission of the virus from one patient to another in a French hospital.\n\n\nMethods\nPatient 1 visited Dubai in April, 2013; patient 2 lives in France and did not travel abroad.\n\n Both patients had underlying immunosuppressive disorders.\n\n We tested specimens from the upper (nasopharyngeal swabs) or the lower (bronchoalveolar lavage, sputum) respiratory tract and whole blood, plasma, and serum specimens for MERS-CoV by real-time RT-PCR targeting the upE and Orf1A genes of MERS-CoV.\n\n\nFindings\nInitial clinical presentation included fever, chills, and myalgia in both patients, and for patient 1, diarrhoea.\n\n Respiratory symptoms rapidly became predominant with acute respiratory failure leading to mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).\n\n Both patients developed acute renal failure.\n\n MERS-CoV was detected in lower respiratory tract specimens with high viral load (eg, cycle threshold [Ct] values of 22·9 for upE and 24 for Orf1a for a bronchoalveolar lavage sample from patient 1; Ct values of 22·5 for upE and 23·9 for Orf1a for an induced sputum sample from patient 2), whereas nasopharyngeal specimens were weakly positive or inconclusive.\n\n The two patients shared the same room for 3 days.\n\n The incubation period was estimated at 9–12 days for the second case.\n\n No secondary transmission was documented in hospital staff despite the absence of specific protective measures before the diagnosis of MERS-CoV was suspected.\n\n Patient 1 died on May 28, due to refractory multiple organ failure.\n\n\nInterpretation\nPatients with respiratory symptoms returning from the Middle East or exposed to a confirmed case should be isolated and investigated for MERS-CoV with lower respiratory tract sample analysis and an assumed incubation period of 12 days.\n\n

Infection with Novel Human Coronavirus EMC Predicts Potential Antivirals and Important Differences with SARS Coronavirus","abstract":"A novel human coronavirus (HCoV-EMC) was recently identified in the Middle East as the causative agent of a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) resembling the illness caused by SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV).\n Although derived from the CoV family, the two viruses are genetically distinct and do not use the same receptor.\n Here, we investigated whether HCoV-EMC and SARS-CoV induce similar or distinct host responses after infection of a human lung epithelial cell line.\n HCoV-EMC was able to replicate as efficiently as SARS-CoV in Calu-3 cells and similarly induced minimal transcriptomic changes before 12 h postinfection.\n Later in infection, HCoV-EMC induced a massive dysregulation of the host transcriptome, to a much greater extent than SARS-CoV.\n Both viruses induced a similar activation of pattern recognition receptors and the interleukin 17 (IL-17) pathway, but HCoV-EMC specifically down-regulated the expression of several genes within the antigen presentation pathway, including both type I and II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes.\n This could have an important impact on the ability of the host to mount an adaptive host response.\n A unique set of 207 genes was dysregulated early and permanently throughout infection with HCoV-EMC, and was used in a computational screen to predict potential antiviral compounds, including kinase inhibitors and glucocorticoids.\n Overall, HCoV-EMC and SARS-CoV elicit distinct host gene expression responses, which might impact in vivo pathogenesis and could orient therapeutic strategies against that emergent virus.\n","id":"PMC3663187","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"American Society of

during Early Lung Development","abstract":"Many organs of higher organisms, such as the vascular system, lung, kidney, pancreas, liver and glands, are heavily branched structures.\n The branching process during lung development has been studied in great detail and is remarkably stereotyped.\n The branched tree is generated by the sequential, non-random use of three geometrically simple modes of branching (domain branching, planar and orthogonal bifurcation).\n While many regulatory components and local interactions have been defined an integrated understanding of the regulatory network that controls the branching process is lacking.\n We have developed a deterministic, spatio-temporal differential-equation based model of the core signaling network that governs lung branching morphogenesis.\n The model focuses on the two key signaling factors that have been identified in experiments, fibroblast growth factor (FGF10) and sonic hedgehog (SHH) as well as the SHH receptor patched (Ptc).\n We show that the reported biochemical interactions give rise to a Schnakenberg-type Turing patterning mechanisms that allows us to reproduce experimental observations in wildtype and mutant mice.\n The kinetic parameters as well as the domain shape are based on experimental data where available.\n The developed model is robust to small absolute and large relative changes in the parameter values.\n At the same time there is a strong regulatory potential in that the switching between branching modes can be achieved by targeted changes in the parameter values.\n We note that the sequence of different branching events may also be the result of different growth speeds: fast growth triggers lateral branching while slow growth favours bifurcations in our model.\n We conclude that the FGF10-SHH-Ptc1 module is sufficient to generate pattern that correspond to the observed branching modes.\n","id":"PMC3280966","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China,

coronavirus antibodies in Saudi Arabia: a nationwide, cross-sectional, serological study","abstract":"Background\nScientific evidence suggests that dromedary camels are the intermediary host for the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).\n\n However, the actual number of infections in people who have had contact with camels is unknown and most index patients cannot recall any such contact.\n\n We aimed to do a nationwide serosurvey in Saudi Arabia to establish the prevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies, both in the general population and in populations of individuals who have maximum exposure to camels.\n\n\nMethods\nIn the cross-sectional serosurvey, we tested human serum samples obtained from healthy individuals older than 15 years who attended primary health-care centres or participated in a national burden-of-disease study in all 13 provinces of Saudi Arabia.\n\n Additionally, we tested serum samples from shepherds and abattoir workers with occupational exposure to camels.\n\n Samples were screened by recombinant ELISA and MERS-CoV seropositivity was confirmed by recombinant immunofluorescence and plaque reduction neutralisation tests.\n\n We used two-tailed Mann Whitney U exact tests, ?2, and Fisher's exact tests to analyse the data.\n\n\nFindings\nBetween Dec 1, 2012, and Dec 1, 2013, we obtained individual serum samples from 10?009 individuals.\n\n Anti-MERS-CoV antibodies were confirmed in 15 (0·15%; 95% CI 0·09–0·24) of 10?009 people in six of the 13 provinces.\n\n The mean age of seropositive individuals was significantly younger than that of patients with reported, laboratory-confirmed, primary Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (43·5 years [SD 17·3] vs 53·8 years [17·5]; p=0·008).\n\n Men had a higher antibody prevalence than did women (11 [0·25%] of 4341 vs two [0·05%] of 4378; p=0·028) and antibody prevalence was significantly higher in central versus coastal provinces (14 [0·26%] of 5479 vs one [0·02%] of 4529; p=0·003).\n\n Compared with the general population, seroprevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies was significantly increased by 15 times in shepherds (two [2·3%] of 87, p=0·0004) and by 23 times in slaughterhouse workers (five [3·6%] of 140; p&lt;0·0001).\n\n\nInterpretation\nSeroprevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies was significantly higher in camel-exposed individuals than in the general population.\n\n By simple multiplication, a projected 44?951 (95% CI 26?971–71?922) individuals older than 15 years might be seropositive for MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia.\n\n These individuals might be the source of infection for patients with confirmed MERS who had no previous exposure to camels.\n\n\nFunding\nEuropean Union, German Centre for Infection Research, Federal Ministry of Education and

extension, and termination of RNA synthesis by a paramyxovirus polymerase","abstract":"Paramyxoviruses represent a family of RNA viruses causing significant human diseases.\n These include measles virus, the most infectious virus ever reported, in addition to parainfluenza virus, and other emerging viruses.\n Paramyxoviruses likely share common replication machinery but their mechanisms of RNA biosynthesis activities and details of their complex polymerase structures are unknown.\n Mechanistic and functional details of a paramyxovirus polymerase would have sweeping implications for understanding RNA virus replication and for the development of new antiviral medicines.\n To study paramyxovirus polymerase structure and function, we expressed an active recombinant Nipah virus (NiV) polymerase complex assembled from the multifunctional NiV L protein bound to its phosphoprotein cofactor.\n NiV is an emerging highly pathogenic virus that causes severe encephalitis and has been declared a global public health concern due to its high mortality rate.\n Using negative-stain electron microscopy, we demonstrated NiV polymerase forms ring-like particles resembling related RNA polymerases.\n We identified conserved sequence elements driving recognition of the 3?-terminal genomic promoter by NiV polymerase, and leading to initiation of RNA synthesis, primer extension, and transition to elongation mode.\n Polyadenylation resulting from NiV polymerase stuttering provides a mechanistic basis for transcription termination.\n It also suggests a divergent adaptation in promoter recognition between pneumo- and paramyxoviruses.\n The lack of available antiviral therapy for NiV prompted us to identify the triphosphate forms of R1479 and GS-5734, two clinically relevant nucleotide analogs, as substrates and inhibitors of NiV polymerase activity by delayed chain termination.\n Overall, these findings provide low-resolution structural details and the mechanism of an RNA polymerase from a previously uncharacterized virus family.\n This work illustrates important functional differences yet remarkable similarities between the polymerases of nonsegmented negative-strand RNA viruses.\n","id":"PMC5823471","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Paul

emergence in both humans and livestock.\n Viruses similar to known epidemic strains circulating in wild and domestic animals further increase the probability of emergence in the future.\n Currently, there are no approved therapeutics for any human CoV presenting a clear unmet medical need.\n Remdesivir (RDV, GS-5734) is a monophosphoramidate prodrug of an adenosine analog with potent activity against an array of RNA virus families including Filoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Pneumoviridae, and Orthocoronavirinae, through the targeting of the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp).\n We developed multiple assays to further define the breadth of RDV antiviral activity against the CoV family.\n Here, we show potent antiviral activity of RDV against endemic human CoVs OC43 (HCoV-OC43) and 229E (HCoV-229E) with submicromolar EC50 values.\n Of known CoVs, the members of the deltacoronavirus genus have the most divergent RdRp as compared to SARS- and MERS-CoV and both avian and porcine members harbor a native residue in the RdRp that confers resistance in beta-CoVs.\n Nevertheless, RDV is highly efficacious against porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV).\n These data further extend the known breadth and antiviral activity of RDV to include both contemporary human and highly divergent zoonotic CoV and potentially enhance our ability to fight future emerging

changes in the lungs of mice infected with influenza virus to determine the progress from viral pneumonia to ARDS/DAD.\n Mice were intranasally infected with influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) virus, and their lungs were examined both macro- and micro-pathologically every 2 days.\n We also evaluated general condition, survival rate, body weight, viral loads in lung, and surfactant proteins in serum.\n As a result, all infected mice died within 9 days postinfection.\n At 2 days postinfection, inflammation in alveolar septa, i.\ne.\n, interstitial pneumonia, was observed around bronchioles.\n From 4 to 6 days postinfection, interstitial pneumonia with alveolar collapse expanded throughout the lungs.\n From 6 to 9 days postinfection, DAD with severe alveolar collapse was observed in the lungs of all of dying and dead mice.\n In contrast, DAD was not observed in the live infected-mice from 2 to 6 days postinfection, despite their poor general condition.\n In addition, histopathological analysis was performed in mice infected with a dose of PR8 virus which was 50% of the lethal dose for mice in the 20-day observation period.\n DAD with alveolar collapse was observed in all dead mice.\n However, in the surviving mice, instead of DAD, glandular metaplasia was broadly observed in their lungs.\n The present study indicates that DAD with severe alveolar collapse is associated with death in this mouse infection model of influenza virus.\n Inhibition of the development of DAD with alveolar collapse may decrease the mortality rate in severe viral pneumonia caused

spike (S) protein S2 subunit to fuse with the plasma or endosomal membrane.\n Previous work identified a peptide derived from the heptad repeat (HR) 2 domain in S2 subunit, HR2P, which potently blocked MERS-CoV S protein–mediated membrane fusion.\n Here, we tested an HR2P analogue with improved pharmaceutical property, HR2P-M2, for its inhibitory activity against MERS-CoV infection in vitro and in vivo.\n HR2P-M2 was highly effective in inhibiting MERS-CoV S protein–mediated cell-cell fusion and infection by pseudoviruses expressing MERS-CoV S protein with or without mutation in the HR1 region.\n It interacted with the HR1 peptide to form stable ?-helical complex and blocked six-helix bundle formation between the HR1 and HR2 domains in the viral S protein.\n Intranasally administered HR2P-M2 effectively protected adenovirus serotype-5–human dipeptidyl peptidase 4–transduced mice from infection by MERS-CoV strains with or without mutations in the HR1 region of S protein, with &gt;1000-fold reduction of viral titers in lung, and the protection was enhanced by combining HR2P-M2 with interferon ?.\n These results indicate that this combination regimen merits further development to prevent MERS in high-risk populations, including healthcare workers and patient family members, and to treat MERS-CoV–infected patients.\n","id":"PMC4655857","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Oxford University

in the Republic of Korea","abstract":"Background\nFrom May to July 2015, the Republic of Korea experienced the largest outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outside the Arabian Peninsula.\n\n A total of 186 patients, including 36 deaths, had been diagnosed with MERS-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection as of September 30th, 2015.\nMaterials and Methods\nWe obtained information of patients who were confirmed to have MERS-CoV infection.\n\n MERS-CoV infection was diagnosed using real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 55 years (range, 16 to 86).\n\n A total of 55.4% of the patients had one or more coexisting medical conditions.\n\n The most common symptom was fever (95.2%).\n\n At admission, leukopenia (42.6%), thrombocytopenia (46.6%), and elevation of aspartate aminotransferase (42.7%) were observed.\n\n Pneumonia was detected in 68.3% of patients at admission and developed in 80.8% during the disease course.\n\n Antiviral agents were used for 74.7% of patients.\n\n Mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and convalescent serum were employed for 24.5%, 7.1%, and 3.8% of patients, respectively.\n\n Older age, presence of coexisting medical conditions including diabetes or chronic lung disease, presence of dyspnea, hypotension, and leukocytosis at admission, and the use of mechanical ventilation were revealed to be independent predictors of death.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe clinical features of MERS-CoV infection in the Republic of Korea were similar to those of previous outbreaks in the Middle East.\n\n However, the overall mortality rate (20.4%) was lower than that in previous reports.\n\n Enhanced surveillance and active management of patients during the outbreak may have resulted in improved outcomes.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4945721","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"The Korean Society of Infectious Diseases and Korean Society for

and epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and Prevention of Infectious Disease in China,

however, the genetic mechanisms underlying cross-species adaptation remain poorly understood.\n Variation in the host receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), can block the interaction with the MERS-CoV spike protein and form a species barrier to infection.\n To better understand the species adaptability of MERS-CoV, we identified a suboptimal species-derived variant of DPP4 to study viral adaption.\n Passaging virus on cells expressing this DPP4 variant led to accumulation of mutations in the viral spike which increased replication.\n Parallel passages revealed distinct paths of viral adaptation to the same DPP4 variant.\n Structural analysis and functional assays showed that these mutations enhanced viral entry with suboptimal DPP4 by altering the surface charge of spike.\n These

implication of a novel beta (?)-CoV as the cause of fatal respiratory disease in the Middle East emphasizes the importance of surveillance for CoVs that have potential to move from bats into the human population.\n In a screen of 606 bats from 42 different species in Campeche, Chiapas and Mexico City we identified 13 distinct CoVs.\n Nine were alpha (?)-CoVs; four were ?-CoVs.\n Twelve were novel.\n Analyses of these viruses in the context of their hosts and ecological habitat indicated that host species is a strong selective driver in CoV evolution, even in allopatric populations separated by significant geographical distance; and that a single species/genus of bat can contain multiple CoVs.\n A ?-CoV with 96.5?% amino acid identity to the ?-CoV associated with human disease in the Middle East was found in a Nyctinomops laticaudatus bat, suggesting that efforts to identify the viral reservoir should include surveillance of the bat families Molossidae/Vespertilionidae, or the closely related Nycteridae/Emballonuridae.\n While it is important to investigate unknown viral diversity in bats, it is also important to remember that the majority of viruses they carry will not pose any clinical risk, and bats should not be stigmatized ubiquitously as significant threats to public health.\n","id":"PMC3709589","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Society for

China\nDear Editor,\nThe rapid emergence of COVID-19 in Wuhan city, Hubei Province, China, has resulted in thousands of deaths. Many infected patients, however, presented mild flu-like symptoms and quickly recover. To effectively prioritize resources for patients with the highest risk, we identified clinical predictors of mild and severe patient outcomes.\nUsing the database of Jin Yin-tan Hospital and Tongji Hospital, we conducted a retrospective multicenter study of 68 death cases (68/150, 45%) and 82 discharged cases (82/150, 55%) with laboratory-confirmed infection of SARS-CoV-2. Patients met the discharge criteria if they had no fever for at least 3 days, significantly improved respiratory function, and had negative SARS-CoV-2 laboratory test results twice in succession. Case data included demographics, clinical characteristics, laboratory results, treatment options and outcomes. For statistical analysis, we represented continuous measurements as means (SDs) or as medians (IQRs) which compared with Student's t test or the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test. Categorical variables were expressed as numbers (%) and compared by the chi2 test or Fisher's exact test.\na Age distribution of patients with confirmed COVID-19; b key laboratory parameters for the outcomes of patients with confirmed COVID-19; c interval from onset of symptom to death of patients with confirmed COVID-19; d summary of the cause of death of 68 died patients with confirmed COVID-19\nThe distribution of the enrolled patients' age is shown in Fig. 1a. There was a significant difference in age between the death group and the discharge group (p &lt; 0.001) but no difference in the sex ratio (p = 0.43). A total of 63% (43/68) of patients in the death group and 41% (34/82) in the discharge group had underlying diseases (p = 0.0069). It should be noted that patients with cardiovascular diseases have a significantly increased risk of death when they are infected with SARS-CoV-2 (p &lt; 0.001). A total of 16% (11/68) of the patients in the death group had secondary infections, and 1% (1/82) of the patients in the discharge group had secondary infections (p = 0.0018). Laboratory results showed that there were significant differences in white blood cell counts, absolute values of lymphocytes, platelets, albumin, total bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen, blood creatinine, myoglobin, cardiac troponin, C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) between the two groups (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 1).\nThe survival times of the enrolled patients in the death group were analyzed. The distribution of survival time from disease onset to death showed two peaks, with the first one at approximately 14 days (22 cases) and the second one at approximately 22 days (17 cases) (Fig. 1c). An analysis of the cause of death was performed. Among the 68 fatal cases, 36 patients (53%) died of respiratory failure, five patients (7%) with myocardial damage died of circulatory failure, 22 patients (33%) died of both, and five remaining died of an unknown cause (Fig. 1d). Based on the analysis of the clinical data, we confirmed that some patients died of fulminant myocarditis. In this study, we first reported that the infection of SARS-CoV-2 may cause fulminant myocarditis. Given that fulminant myocarditis is characterized by a rapid progress and a severe state of illness, our results should alert physicians to pay attention not only to the symptoms of respiratory dysfunction but also the symptoms of cardiac injury.\nFurther, large-scale studies and the studies on autopsy are needed to confirm our analysis.\nIn conclusion, predictors of a fatal outcome in COVID-19 cases included age, the presence of underlying diseases, the presence of secondary infection and elevated inflammatory indicators in the blood. The results obtained from this study also suggest that COVID-19 mortality might be due to virus-activated &quot;cytokine storm syndrome&quot; or fulminant myocarditis.\nElectronic supplementary material\nBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material.\nPublisher's Note\nSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.\nQiurong Ruan and Kun Yang have contributed equally to this work.\nChange history\n4/6/2020\nClinical predictors of mortality due to COVID-19 based on an analysis of data of 150 patients from Wuhan, China.\nAuthors contribution\nJXS, QRR and KY contributed to the conception and design of the study, had full access to all the data in the study and take responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.

67 men and 32 women.\n\n 2019-nCoV was detected in all patients by real-time RT-PCR.\n\n 50 (51%) patients had chronic diseases.\n\n Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (82 [83%] patients), cough (81 [82%] patients), shortness of breath (31 [31%] patients), muscle ache (11 [11%] patients), confusion (nine [9%] patients), headache (eight [8%] patients), sore throat (five [5%] patients), rhinorrhoea (four [4%] patients), chest pain (two [2%] patients), diarrhoea (two [2%] patients), and nausea and vomiting (one [1%] patient).\n\n According to imaging examination, 74 (75%) patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 14 (14%) patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity, and one (1%) patient had pneumothorax.\n\n 17 (17%) patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and, among them, 11 (11%) patients worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection was of clustering onset, is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n In general, characteristics of patients who died were in line with the MuLBSTA score, an early warning model for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia.\n\n Further investigation is needed to explore the applicability of the MuLBSTA score in predicting the risk of mortality in 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key R&amp;D Program of China.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7135076","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing Municipal Science and Technology

and importantly, for the first time, we describe a new treatment regimen termed life support-based comprehensive treatment regimen.\n The core content of this treatment regimen includes (i) mechanical life support (applications of mechanical respirators and circulatory support systems, including intraaortic balloon pump and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, (ii) immunological modulation by using sufficient doses of glucocorticoid, immunoglobulin and (iii) antiviral reagents using neuraminidase inhibitor.\n The proper application of this treatment regimen may and has helped to save the lives

venoarterial extracorporeal membranous oxygenation (ECMO) support is effective in patients with cardiogenic shock or fatal arrhythmia due to fulminant myocarditis.\n\n The clinical courses of fulminant myocarditis are still uncertain; therefore, it is difficult to determine the appropriate time for discontinuing ECMO or converting to a ventricular assist device.\n\n The purpose of this study was to investigate the prognosis of patients with fulminant myocarditis managed by ECMO.\n\n\nMethods\nTwenty-two consecutive patients with fulminant myocarditis managed by peripheral venoarterial ECMO between 1999 and 2013 were enrolled.\n\n\nResults\nSurvival to discharge was 59% (13 patients), and in-hospital mortality was 41% (9 patients).\n\n The age in the survivor group was significantly lower than that in the non-survivor group (survivor group vs.\n\n non-survivor group; 36.5?±?4.1 vs.\n\n 60.2?±?5.0 years, p?=?0.001).\n\n Although the ECMO support duration was similar between the groups (181?±?22 vs.\n\n 177?±?31 h), the rate of complication related to ECMO was significantly lower in the survivor group (15.3% vs.\n\n 66.6%, p?=?0.02).\n\n When comparing the laboratory data during ECMO management between the groups, the serum bilirubin level on day 7 was significantly lower in the survivor group (total: 4.6?±?2.8 vs.\n\n 13.7?±?10.8 mg/dL, p?=?0.014; direct: 2.2?±?0.5 vs.\n\n 9.8?±?4.5 mg/dL, p?=?0.009).\n\n\nConclusions\nFulminant myocarditis is associated with high mortality rates despite ECMO.\n\n An older age and complications related to ECMO are associated with poor prognosis.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4336280","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

favorable; however, for 32–36% of patients, this condition becomes fatal during the acute stages despite the use of mechanical circulatory support.\n\n Other therapeutic options may be needed for patients in whom these conditions are resistant to aggressive management.\n\n\nCase Report:\nWe present a case of fulminant myocarditis that rapidly progressed to cardiogenic shock and in-hospital cardiac arrest in a 46-year-old male.\n\n The patient promptly received inotropic agents, intra-aortic balloon pump therapy, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.\n\n However, creatinine kinase (CK), C-reactive protein (CRP), and QRS width increased significantly between days 1 and 3 of treatment; the patient’s hemodynamic profile deteriorated despite this treatment regimen.\n\n Intravenous methylprednisolone was initiated on day 3 at a dose of 1,000 mg/day and maintained for an additional three days.\n\n Less than 24 h after methylprednisolone administration, the QRS width decreased significantly from 0.44 s to 0.18 s.\n\n In addition, CK and CRP levels declined sharply, which is associated with hemodynamic improvement.\n\n\nConclusions:\nHigh doses of intravenous

whether intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was able to improve left ventricular function and reduce the episodes of arrhythmia in adult patients with AFM.\n The medical records of all patients with AFM who were admitted to the Critical Care Unit of Guangdong General Hospital (Guangzhou, China) between January 2001 and December 2010 were reviewed.\n A cohort of 58 patients was included in the study.\n Of these 58, 32 patients were treated with IVIG (400 mg/kg per day) for five days, while the remaining patients did not receive IVIG therapy.\n The patients who received IVIG therapy had a higher left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and a reduced left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVDD) compared with the non-IVIG therapy patients four weeks subsequent to the treatment (PLVEF=0.011 and PLVDD=0.048).\n The post-treatment incidence of ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF) and atrioventricular block (AVB) was reduced in the patients who received IVIG therapy compared with the baseline values (PVT/VF=0.025, PAVB=0.003); however, no significant differences were observed in the non-IVIG therapy patients (PVT/VF=0.564, PAVB=0.083) following treatment.\n There were two mortalities in the IVIG therapy group and seven in the non-IVIG therapy group (P=0.072).\n This retrospective study suggested that the use of IVIG for the treatment of AFM

As of Feb 19, 2020, the total number of patients has risen sharply to 74 283 in the mainland of China, with 2009 (2 7%) deceased. The clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia ranges from mild to critically ill cases. Previous studies have only described the general epidemiological findings, clinical presentation, and clinical outcomes of patients of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. However, specific information characterising critically ill patients remains unknown.\nThe data on the clinical characteristics and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection are scarce, but are of paramount importance to reduce mortality. In this study, we investigated critically ill patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital. The baseline SARS-CoV-2-associated morbidity and mortality data from this study will be of considerable value for the early identification of individuals who are at risk of becoming critically ill and who are most likely to benefit from intensive care treatment.\nMethods\nStudy design and participants\nThis single-centre, retrospective, observational study was done at Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China), which is a designated hospital to treat patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. All patients, except infected healh-care workers from Jin Yin-tan hospital, were transferred from other hospitals. We retrospectively analysed patients from Dec 24, 2019, to Jan 26, 2020, who had been diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, according to WHO interim guidance, and who were critically ill. Laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection was performed by the local health authority as previously described. Critically ill patients were defined as those admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) who required mechanical ventilation or had a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of at least 60% or more. Identification of critically ill patients was achieved by reviewing and analysing admission logs and histories from all available electronic medical records and patient care resources. For patients who were alive by Jan 26, 2020, their living status was confirmed on Feb 9, 2020.\nResearch in context\n Evidence before this study \nThe novel coronavirus disease 2019 is a disease that has affected populations around the world. We searched PubMed for articles published up to Feb 11, 2020, using the keywords &quot;2019 novel coronavirus&quot;, &quot;2019-nCoV&quot;, &quot;COVID-19&quot;, or &quot;SARS-CoV-2&quot;. We identified eight articles that describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, none of these studies focused on characterising critically ill patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, who are at increased risk of death.\n Added value of this study \nWe report the clinical courses and clinical outcomes of 52 critically ill patients from 710 laboratory-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2. 35 (67%) patients had acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and 37 (71%) required mechanical ventilation. 32 (61 5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from intensive care unit (ICU) admission to death was 7 (IQR 3-11) days in non-survivors. Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64 6 years [11 2] vs 51 9 years [12 9]), more likely to develop acute respiratory distress (ARDS; 26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n Implications of all the available evidence \nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia at 28 days is considerable. The survival time of non-survivors is likely to be within 1-2 weeks after ICU admission. Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death. The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\nThe Ethics Commission of Jin Yin-tan hospital approved this study (KY-2020-06.01). Written informed consent was waived due to the rapid emergence of this infectious disease.\nData collection\nWe reviewed clinical electronic medical records, nursing records, laboratory findings, and radiological examinations for all patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The admission data of these patients were collected. Data were evaluated and collected, by using a case record form modified from the standardised International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium case report forms. Any missing or uncertain records were collected and clarified through direct communication with involved health-care providers and their families.\nWe collected data on age, sex, exposure history, chronic medical histories (chronic cardiac disease, chronic pulmonary disease, cerebrovascular disease, chronic neurological disorder, diabetes, malignancy, dementia, malnutrition, and smoking), symptoms from onset to hospital admission (fever, cough, dyspnoea, myalgia, malaise, rhinorrhoea, arthralgia, chest pain, headache, and vomiting), vital signs at ICU admission (heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure), laboratory values on admission (haemoglobin concentration, lymphocyte count, platelet count, arterial blood gas analysis, FiO2, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2), and lactate concentration), coexisted infection, treatment (oxygen therapy, vasoconstrictive agents, antiviral agents, antibacterial agents, corticosteroids, and immunoglobulin), as well as living status. During the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the number of critically ill patients exceeded the capacity of ICUs. Therefore, two provisional ICUs were urgently established in Jin Yin-tan hospital and hence most mechanical ventilator settings and recordings were not recorded, except records of positive end-expiratory pressure in some cases. As a routine, electronic medical data were archived onto a local server, from which we retrieved these data.\nOutcomes\nThe primary outcome was 28-day mortality after ICU admission. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation. ARDS and shock were defined according to the guidance of WHO for novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Acute kidney injury was identified on the basis of serum creatinine. Cardiac injury was diagnosed if the serum concentration of hypersensitive cardiac troponin I (hsTNI) was above the upper limit of the reference range (&gt;28 pg/mL), measured in the laboratory of Jin Yin-tan Hospital.\nStatistical analysis\nThe aim of this study is to report the clinical courses and clinical outcomes of critically ill patients being cared for in the hospital during the study period. There were, therefore, no formal hypotheses being implemented to drive the sample size calculation and we included the maximum number of patients who met the inclusion criteria.\nWe expressed descriptive data as mean (SD) or median (IQR) for continuous variables and number (%) for categorical variables. We assessed differences between survivors and non-survivors using two-sample t test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test depending on parametric or non-parametric data for continuous variables and Fisher's exact test for categorical variables. We used a Kaplan-Meier plot for survival data.\nTests were two-sided with significance set at alpha less than 0 05. The Stata/IC 15.1 software (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA) was applied for all analyses.\nResults\nStudy flow diagram\nSARS-CoV-2=severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.

SARS-CoV-2=severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. SOFA=Sequential Organ Failure Assessment.\nThe median Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score of all patients was 17 (IQR 14-19; table 3 ). Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax (table 2). The median hsTNI was 161 0 (IQR 41 8-766 1) pg/mL. Hospital-acquired infection was noted in seven (13 5%) patients, including one (2%) patient who had pulmonary and blood stream infection of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. Other microorganisms identified from respiratory tract secretions in five (10%) patients included Aspergillus flavus, A fumigatus, extended-spectrum beta-Lactamase (ESBL)-positive K pneumonia, ESBL-positive Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and ESBL-negative Serratia marcescens, with each microorganism found in one patient each. Candida albicans was identified in the urine culture of one (2%) patient (table 2).\n33 (63 5%) patients were treated with high-flow nasal cannula, 37 (71%) with mechanical ventilation, six (11 5%) with prone position ventilation, six (11 5%) with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), nine (17%) with renal replacement therapy, and 18 (35%) with vasoconstrictive agents (table 2). 23 (44%) patients received antiviral agents, 49 (94%) received antibacterial agents, and 30 (58%) patients received glucocorticoids (table 2). Oseltamivir was given to 18 (35%) patients, ganciclovir to 14 (27%), and lopinavir to seven (13 5%).\nSurvival of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia\nDashed lines represent 95% CIs. One patient died within 24 h after admission to the intensive care unit (ICU).\nFor the primary outcome, among 52 critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 32 (61 5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from ICU admission to death was 7 (IQR 3-11) days in the non-survivors (figure 2 ). Compared with survivors, non-survivors were more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] vs 9 [45%]) and were more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] vs 7 [35%]). 30 (81%) of 37 patients requiring mechanical ventilation had died by 28 days.\nOf the 20 patients who survived, eight patients were discharged. Three patients were still on invasive ventilation at 28 days, including one patient who was also on ECMO. One patient was on non-invasive ventilation, two were using high-flow nasal cannula, and six were using common nasal cannula.\nCompared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64 6 [SD 11 2] vs 51 9 [12 9]) and were more likely to have chronic medical illnesses (17 (53%) patients vs 4 (20%) patients; table 1). Neither the median duration from onset of symptoms to radiological confirmation of pneumonia or from onset of symptoms to ICU admission were different between survivors and non-survivors (table 3). The ratio of partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) to FiO2 was significantly lower in non-survivors. Based on APACHE II score and SOFA score at ICU admission, non-survivors were in a more critical condition than survivors. In the cohort, lymphocytopenia occurred in 44 (85%) patients, with no significant difference between the two groups. Compared with survivors, non-survivors were more likely to develop ARDS, and to receive mechanical ventilation, either invasively or non-invasively.\nDiscussion\nWe report on 52 critically ill patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterised by severe hypoxaemia. 32 (61 5%) of critically ill patients had died at 28 days. Of all included patients, 37 (71%) required mechanical ventilation and 35 (67%) had ARDS.\nSince no specialised medication to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection has been identified at this time, the mainstay of treatment has been supportive care. Patients are being treated in isolation, and their close contacts are being quarantined. For non-critically ill patients, close follow-up is likely to be sufficient to manage the disease. For critically ill patients, however, aggressive treatments and intensive care are needed. To our knowledge, this is the first study to characterise critically ill patients infected by SARS-CoV-2. In three previously published studies of crtically ill patients, the patient numbers were too small to summarise the characteristics and mortality of these patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. \nLike SARS-CoV and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus that can be transmitted to humans, and these viruses are all related to high mortality in critically ill patients. However, the mortality rate in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in our cohort is higher than that previously seen in critically ill patients with SARS. In a cohort of 38 critically ill patients with SARS from 13 hospitals in Canada, 29 (76%) patients required mechanical ventilation, 13 (43%) patients had died at 28 days, and six (16%) patients remained on mechanical ventilation. 17 (38%) of 45 patients and 14 (26%) of 54 patients who were critically ill with SARS infection were also reported to have died at 28 days in a Singapore cohort and a Hong Kong cohort, respectively. The mortality rate in our cohort is likely to be higher than that seen in critically ill patients with MERS infection. In a cohort of 12 patients with MERS from two hospitals in Saudi Arabia, seven (58%) patients had died at 90 days. Since the follow-up time is shorter in our cohort, we postulate that the mortality rate would be higher after 28 days than that seen in patients with MERS-CoV.\nThe fundamental pathophysiology of severe viral pneumonia is severe ARDS. Men and people of an older age (&gt;65 years) are more likely to develop ARDS than women or those of a younger age. Therefore, it is reasonable that the mortality at 28 days of severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is similar to the mortality of severe ARDS, which is near 50%. With a substantial increase in the number of critically ill patients infected by SARS-CoV-2, more provisional ICUs are being established in Wuhan, China. Qualified specialists are coming to Wuhan from other provinces of China and are currently working in these provisional ICUs, fever clinics, and newly constructed hospitals. As the clinical capacity to treat patients improves, the mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is expected to decrease.\nAs mentioned in previous studies, nearly 70% of patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 were men. The patients are older in our study than in previous studies. We observed that non-survivors were older than survivors. Based on previous studies, evidence suggests that older, male patients are the most susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is supported by our data. As previously reported, patients with a history of cerebrovascular disease are at increased risk of becoming critically ill or dying if they have SARS-CoV-2 infection. \nIn our cohort, fever is the most common symptom in patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, which is in accordance with previous studies, but not all patients had fever. We also found that fever was not detected at the onset of illness in six (11 5%), and that it was in fact detected 2-8 days later. The delay of fever manifestation hinders early identification of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2:if patients are asymptomatic identification of suspected cases is more difficult. The median duration from onset of symptoms to radiological confirmation of pneumonia was 5 (3-7) days, meaning that early or repeated radiological examinations are useful in screening patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. \nAs for laboratory tests, lymphocytopenia occurred in more than 80% of critically ill patients in our cohort. Lymphocytopenia is a prominent feature of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV infection because targeted invasion by SARS-CoV viral particles damages the cytoplasmic component of the lymphocyte and causes its destruction. Additionally, lymphocytopenia is also common in the critically ill patients with MERS infection, which is the result of apoptosis of lymphocytes. Therefore, we postulate that necrosis or apoptosis of lymphocytes also induces lymphocytopenia in critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. In a previous study, mainly in non-critical patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, 35% of patients had only mild lymphocytopenia, suggesting that the severity of lymphocytopenia reflects the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nMechanical ventilation is the main supportive treatment for critically ill patients. The PaO2/FiO2 ratio was lower in our patients than in patients admitted to Zhongnan Hospital. The substantial difference in PaO2/FiO2 ratio between survivors and non-survivors in our study, indicates this ratio is associated with the severity of illness and thus prognosis. Barotrauma seems less severe in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who are being mechanically ventilated than that seen in mechanically ventilated patients with SARS-CoV. In our study, barotrauma occurred in only one (2%) patient, who had been hospitalised for nearly 1 month, and he is currently on a ventilator and receiving ECMO. In patients with SARS, barotrauma occurred in about 25% of patients on mechanical ventilation. The lower occurrence of barotrauma in our cohort is probably related to the widely accepted strategy of protective ventilation in mainland China. At the same time, prone position and ECMO have been used to treat patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\nWithout solid evidence, nearly half of the patients were given antiviral agents, and more than half were given intravenous glucocorticoids. Patients treated with lopinavir were from an ongoing clinical trial registered on Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2000029308). Remdesivir was given to the first patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in the USA. Trials on remdesivir are about to recruit both mild to moderate patients (NCT04252664) and severe patients (NCT04257656) infected with SARS-CoV-2. Although, intravenous glucocorticoids were commonly used in patients with severe SARS or MERS pneumonia, their efficacy remains controversial and their use to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection is also controversial. An ongoing clinical trial (NCT04244591) might shed some light on the safety and efficacy of these drugs as treatment.\nThis study has several limitations. First, only 52 critically ill patients were included. However, the population from which they were sampled was much larger than that of the three studies previously published. We included all the critically ill patients being cared for in the ICU of Jin Yin-tan hospital who met the inclusion criteria. Due to the exploratory nature of the study, which was not driven by formal hypotheses, the sample size calculation was waived. Instead, we hope that the findings presented here will encourage a larger cohort study or potentially some randomly controlled trials. Second, some specific information from the ICU was missing, such as mechanical ventilation settings. The data on radiographical examination, supportive treatment, living status, and the duration from ICU admission to death, however, are indisputable. Third, this is a retrospective study. The data in this study permit a preliminary assessment of the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Further studies are still needed.\nIn conclusion, the mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is high. The survival term of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1-2 weeks after ICU admission. Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death. The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain to hospital critical care resources, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n This online publication has been corrected.

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui Ming, Hui Hoy and Chow Sin Lan Charity Fund Limited, Marina Man-Wai Lee, the Hong Kong Hainan Commercial Association South China Microbiology Research Fund, Sanming Project of Medicine (Shenzhen), and High Level-Hospital Program (Guangdong Health Commission).\n\n\n","id":"PMC7159286","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Jasper Fuk-Woo","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shuofeng","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kin-Hang","surname":"Kok","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kelvin Kai-Wang","surname":"To","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hin","surname":"Chu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jin","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fanfan","surname":"Xing","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jieling","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Cyril Chik-Yan","surname":"Yip","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rosana Wing-Shan","surname":"Poon","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hoi-Wah","surname":"Tsoi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Simon Kam-Fai","surname":"Lo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kwok-Hung","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Vincent Kwok-Man","surname":"Poon","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wan-Mui","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jonathan Daniel","surname":"Ip","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jian-Piao","surname":"Cai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Vincent Chi-Chung","surname":"Cheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Honglin","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christopher Kim-Ming","surname":"Hui","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kwok-Yung","surname":"Yuen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30211-7","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study","abstract":"Background\nIn December, 2019, a pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China.\n\n We aimed to further clarify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020.

pulmonary complications can result in significant morbidity and mortality, cardiovascular complications may also occur.\n\n\nObjective\nThis brief report evaluates cardiovascular complications in the setting of COVID-19 infection.\n\n\nDiscussion\nThe current COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in over one million infected worldwide and thousands of death.\n\n The virus binds and enters through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).\n\n COVID-19 can result in systemic inflammation, multiorgan dysfunction, and critical illness.\n\n The cardiovascular system is also affected, with complications including myocardial injury, myocarditis, acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, dysrhythmias, and venous thromboembolic events.\n\n Current therapies for COVID-19 may interact with cardiovascular medications.\n\n\nConclusions\nEmergency clinicians should be aware of these cardiovascular complications when evaluating and managing the patient with

findings for 50 patients with SARS, representing more than five separate epidemiologically linked transmission clusters.\n\n We defined the clinical presentation and risk factors associated with severe disease and investigated the causal agents by chest radiography and laboratory testing of nasopharyngeal aspirates and sera samples.\n\n We compared the laboratory findings with those submitted for microbiological investigation of other diseases from patients whose identity was masked.\n\n\nFindings\nPatients' age ranged from 23 to 74 years.\n\n Fever, chills, myalgia, and cough were the most frequent complaints.\n\n When compared with chest radiographic changes, respiratory symptoms and auscultatory findings were disproportionally mild.\n\n Patients who were household contacts of other infected people and had older age, lymphopenia, and liver dysfunction were associated with severe disease.\n\n A virus belonging to the family Coronaviridae was isolated from two patients.\n\n By use of serological and reverse-transcriptase PCR specific for this virus, 45 of 50 patients with SARS, but no controls, had evidence of infection with this virus.\n\n\nInterpretation\nA coronavirus

An integrated database was constructed from several sources containing information on epidemiological, demographic, and clinical variables.\n\n We estimated the key epidemiological distributions: infection to onset, onset to admission, admission to death, and admission to discharge.\n\n We measured associations between the estimated case fatality rate and patients’age and the time from onset to admission.\n\n\nFindings\nAfter the initial phase of exponential growth, the rate of confirmed cases fell to less than 20 per day by April 28. Public-health interventions included encouragement to report to hospital rapidly after the onset of clinical symptoms, contact tracing for confirmed and suspected cases, and quarantining, monitoring, and restricting the travel of contacts.\n\n The mean incubation period of the disease is estimated to be 6.4 days (95% Cl 5.2–7.7).\n\n The mean time from onset of clinical symptoms to admission to hospital varied between 3 and 5 days, with longer times earlier in the epidemic.\n\n The estimated case fatality rate was 13.2% (9.8–16.8) for patients younger than 60 years and 43.3% (35.2–52.4) for patients aged 60 years or older assuming a parametric ? distribution.\n\n A non-parametric method yielded estimates of 6.8% (4.0–9.6) and 55.0% (45.3–64.7), respectively.\n\n Case clusters have played an important part in the course of the epidemic.\n\n\nInterpretation\nPatients’age was strongly associated with outcome.\n\n The time between onset of symptoms and admission to hospital did not alter outcome, but shorter intervals will be important to the wider population by restricting the infectious period before patients are placed in quarantine.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7112380","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Christl A","surname":"Donnelly","email":"c.donnelly@imperial.ac.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Azra C","surname":"Ghani","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gabriel M","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Anthony J","surname":"Hedley","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Christophe","surname":"Fraser","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Steven","surname":"Riley","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Laith J","surname":"Abu-Raddad","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lai-Ming","surname":"Ho","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Thuan-Quoc","surname":"Thach","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Patsy","surname":"Chau","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"King-Pan","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tai-Hing","surname":"Lam","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lai-Yin","surname":"Tse","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Thomas","surname":"Tsang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shao-Haei","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"James HB","surname":"Kong","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Edith MC","surname":"Lau","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Neil M","surname":"Ferguson","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Roy M","surname":"Anderson","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2003) Updated interim US case definition for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-update, 30 April 2003 http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/casedefinition.htm","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Leigh JM (1990) Oxygen therapy.
