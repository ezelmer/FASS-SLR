Acute respiratory distress syndrome and respiratory failure, sepsis, acute cardiac injury, and heart failure were the most common critical complications during exacerbation of covid-19.\nIntroduction\nCoronaviruses are important pathogens of humans and animals that can cause diseases ranging from the common cold to more severe and even fatal respiratory infections. In the past two decades two highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, the coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-Cov) and the coronavirus responsible for Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-Cov),  have emerged in two separate events. They induced lower respiratory tract infection as well as extrapulmonary manifestations, leading to hundreds or thousands of cases with high mortality rates of up to 50% in certain populations. In December 2019 a new strain of coronavirus, officially named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2), was first isolated from three patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention,  connected to the cluster of acute respiratory illness cases from Wuhan, China. Recent epidemiological reports have provided evidence for person to person transmission of the SARS-Cov-2 in family and hospital settings.  As of 28 February 2020, the number of patients infected with SARS-Cov-2 has exceeded 83 652 globally, and more than 2858 have now died of covid-19, with the highest mortality rate of 4.47% in Wuhan. On 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization declared that the outbreak of SARS-Cov-2 constituted a public health emergency of international concern.\nEvidence indicates that substantial similarities exist between severe acute respiratory syndrome and covid-19. A recent study reported a 79.5% genome sequence identity between SARS-Cov-2 and SARS-Cov, and SARS-Cov-2 was 96% identical in terms of whole genome sequence to a bat coronavirus. Clinical and pathological features of patients with covid-19 have recently been reported, showing that the SARS-Cov-2 infection causes clusters of severe and even fatal pneumonia with clinical presentation greatly resembling that of SARS-Cov infection, associated with admission to intensive care units and high mortality. The first study of the initial 41 laboratory confirmed cases with covid-19 showed that 28 (68%) of 41 patients had been discharged and six (15%) had died. A larger case series involving 138 consecutive patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 showed that 47 (34%) patients were discharged and six died (overall mortality 4.3%). Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiological differences between patients who were and were not admitted to the intensive care unit have been fully evaluated. Given that the numbers of patients in these studies is relatively small, information about the clinical characteristics of patients who died is scarce. No vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for covid-19 has yet been shown to be effective, so supportive therapy that eases the symptoms and protects multi-organ function may be beneficial. Identifying or more promptly treating patients in high risk groups is crucial to decrease the mortality rate.\nIn this study, we did a comprehensive evaluation of deceased patients and patients recovered among those with confirmed covid-19 who were previously transferred or admitted to the isolation ward of Wuhan Tongji Hospital, which is one of the designated hospitals assigned by Chinese government for patients severely or critically ill with covid-19. We aimed to compare the demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiological features of patients with different clinical outcomes.\nMethods\nStudy participants and data collection\nFrom 13 January to 12 February 2020, 799 moderately to severely ill or critically ill patients with confirmed covid-19 were transferred from other hospitals or isolation sites or admitted from fever clinics to Tongji Hospital. Tongji Hospital was urgently reconstructed and has been assigned by Chinese government as a designed hospital for severely or critically ill patients with covid-19. As of 28 February 2020, 113 of the 799 patients had died, with a mortality rate of up to 14.1%, and 161 patients had recovered and been discharged. The remaining 525 patients were still in hospital and receiving medical care. All patients were diagnosed as having covid-19 and classified as being moderately, severely, or critically ill according to the Guidance for Corona Virus Disease 2019 (6th edition) released by the National Health Commission of China. All the recovered patients with covid-19 had completely resolved symptoms and signs, had significant improvement in pulmonary and extrapulmonary organ dysfunction, and no longer needed supportive care, with confirmed viral clearance by repeated tests for SARS-Cov-2 before hospital discharge. Written informed consent was waived owing to the rapid emergence of this infectious disease.\nWe obtained epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics, as well as treatment and outcome data, from electronic medical records for deceased patients and recovered patients by using data collection forms. We collected data on demographics, medical history, exposure history, underlying chronic diseases, symptoms and signs, laboratory findings, computed tomographic scans of the chest, and treatment (including antiviral therapy, antibiotics, corticosteroid therapy, and oxygen support) during the hospital admission. The clinical data were monitored up to 28 February 2020. The research team of experienced clinicians from Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology analysed patients' medical records. A trained team of physicians and researchers independently entered and cross checked data in a computerised database. If the core data were missing, we sent requests for clarification to the coordinators, who subsequently contacted the clinicians responsible for the treatment of the patients. As some patients presented with various forms of disorder of consciousness on admission, we obtained data on their medical histories and pre-admission information through contact with their close relatives and by accessing medical records from previous hospital visits.\nThe supplementary table shows the criteria and definitions for the diagnosis, clinical classification (mild, moderate, severe, and critically ill), and complications (acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney injury, sepsis, shock, acute liver injury, acute heart failure, and cardiac injury)    for covid-19.\nLaboratory measurements\nReal time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay for SARS-Cov-2\nThroat swab samples were collected for extracting SARS-Cov-2 RNA from patients. The respiratory sample RNA isolation kit (Biogerm, Shanghai, China) was used to extract total RNA within two hours. Briefly, 40 muL of cell lysates were transferred into a collection tube followed by vortex for 10 seconds. After standing at room temperature for 10 minutes, the collection tube was centrifuged at 1000 revolutions per minute for five minutes. The suspension was used for real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of SARS-Cov-2 RNA. Two target genes:open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) and nucleocapsid protein (N):were simultaneously amplified and tested during the real time RT-PCR assay. Target 1 (ORF1ab) comprised forward primer CCCTGTGGGTTTTACACTTAA, reverse primer ACGATTGTGCATCAGCTGA, and the probe 5'-VIC-CCGTCTGCGGTATGTGGAAAGGTTATGG-BHQ1-3'. Target 2 (N) comprised forward primer GGGGAACTTCTCCTGCTAGAAT, reverse primer CAGACATTTTGCTCTCAAGCTG, and the probe 5'-FAM- TTGCTGCTGCTTGACAGATT-TAMRA-3'. The real time RT-PCR assay was conducted using a SARS-Cov-2 nucleic acid detection kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Shanghai Bio-germ Medical Technology company). The reaction mixture contains 12 muL of reaction buffer, 4 muL of enzyme solution, 4 muL of Probe primers solution, 3 muL of diethyl pyrocarbonate treated water, and 2 muL of RNA template. The RT-PCR assay was conducted under the following conditions: incubation at 50 C for 15 minutes and 95 C for five minutes, 40 cycles of denaturation at 94 C for 15 seconds, and extending and collecting fluorescence signal at 55 C for 45 seconds. A cycle threshold value less than 37 was defined as a positive test result, and a cycle threshold value of 40 or more was defined as a negative test. These diagnostic criteria were based on the recommendation by the National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention (China) (http://ivdc.chinacdc.cn/kyjz/202001/t20200121_211337.html). A medium load, defined as a cycle threshold value of 37 to less than 40, required confirmation by retesting.\nClinical laboratory measurements\nInitial clinical laboratory investigation included a complete blood count, serum biochemical tests (including liver and kidney function, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and electrolytes), a coagulation profile, and cytokine tests. Respiratory specimens, including nasal and pharyngeal swabs, or sputum were tested to exclude evidence of other viral infections, including influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, avian influenza, parainfluenza virus, and adenovirus.\nPrinciples of management of patients\nSupportive therapy\nVital signs and oxygen saturation should be monitored (every eight hours; patients with severe disease need continuous monitoring), supportive treatment strengthened, sufficient calories provided, and the stability of the internal environment, such as water, electrolyte, and acid-base balance, maintained. The intake and output volumes should be strictly balanced, especially in critical ill patients.\nOxygen therapy\nSupplemental oxygen therapy should be given immediately to patients with hypoxaemia. Oxygen therapy can be started at a flow rate of 5 L/min, and the target oxygen saturation is pulse oxygen saturation &gt;=90% in non-pregnant adult patients, &gt;=92-95% in pregnant patients, and &gt;=94% in patients who are critically ill with severe respiratory distress, shock, or coma.\nIf standard oxygen therapy fails, mechanical ventilation should be considered; high flow nasal catheter oxygen or non-invasive ventilation (for example, bilevel positive airway pressure mode) can be used. If no improvement is seen within one hour of non-invasive mechanical ventilation, invasive mechanical ventilation should be used. Experienced experts can recommend extracorporeal membrane pulmonary oxygenation according to their evaluation of the patient's situation.\nEmpirical antimicrobial therapy\nIf a history of seasonal or local influenza epidemiology exists, empirical therapy may be considered.\nBlood purification therapy\nContinuous renal replacement therapy can be used in critically ill patients.\nStatistical analysis\nWe present categorical variables as numbers and percentages and continuous variables as mean and standard deviation if they were normally distributed or median and interquartile range if they were not. We compared means for continuous variables by using independent group t tests when the data were normally distributed; otherwise, we used the Mann-Whitney test. We compared proportions for categorical variables by using the chi2 test. We used Fisher's exact test in the analysis of contingency tables when the sample sizes were small. For unadjusted comparisons, we considered a two sided P value below 0.05 to be statistically significant. We used SPSS (version 19.0) for all analyses.\nPatient and public involvement\nThis was a retrospective case series study, and no patients were involved in the study design or in setting the research questions or the outcome measures directly. No patients were asked to advise on interpretation or writing up of results.\nResults\nDemographics and baseline characteristics of deceased patients and recovered patients\nFrom 13 January to 12 February 2020, 799 moderately to severely ill or critically ill patients with confirmed covid-19 were transferred or admitted to Tongji Hospital. As of 28 February 2020, 113 of these patients had died of covid-19 and 161 patients had fully recovered and been discharged. As shown in table 1, the median age of deceased patients was 68 (interquartile range 62.0-77.0) years, which was significantly older than recovered patients (51 (37.0-66.0) years); 94 (83%) deceased patients and 59 (37%) who recovered were aged 60 or older. Male sex was more predominant in deceased patients (83; 73%) than in recovered patients (88; 55%). Overall, 71 (63%) patients who died and 62 (39%) who recovered had at least one chronic medical condition. Hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and cerebrovascular disease were much more frequent among deceased patients (54 (48%), 16 (14%), and 4 (4%)) than among recovered patients (39 (24%), 7 (4%), and 0 (0%)). Few patients had a current or former cigarette smoking history of at least 30 pack years. The proportion of healthcare workers among deceased patients (1; 1%) was significantly lower than among recovered patients (18; 11%). Likewise, the proportion of patients with a history of close contact with previously confirmed patients tended to be lower in deceased patients (44; 12%) than in recovered patients (33; 20%).\nPresenting characteristics of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 who died and recovered patients.

Other prevalent symptoms at onset of illness in deceased patients included fatigue, dyspnoea, chest tightness, and sputum production; less common symptoms included anorexia, diarrhoea, and myalgia. Dyspnoea and chest tightness were much more common in deceased patients (70 (62%) and 55 (49%)) than in recovered patients (50 (31%) and 48 (30%)). Twenty five (22%) people who died and only one (1%) who recovered had disorders of consciousness on hospital admission. Nine deceased patients and 16 who recovered had no fever, with fatigue, cough, dyspnoea, myalgia, or diarrhoea as the initial symptoms. Among these, one patient with no symptoms who recovered was diagnosed as having covid-19 during routine physical examination, and another complained only of stinging eyes for two weeks before being admitted to hospital.\nAmong the deceased patients, the median time from onset of symptoms to hospital admission was 10.0 (interquartile range 7.0-13.0) days, which tended to be longer than for recovered patients (9.0 (6.0-12.0) days). The median time from onset of symptoms to death in deceased patients was 16 (12.0-20.0) days, and the median time from first symptoms to discharge in recovered patients was 26 (21.8-29.0) days. The median time from admission to death was 5 (3.0-9.3) days and the median time from admission to discharge was 16 (14.0-19.0) days.\nMeasures of vital signs were recorded on the day of hospital admission for all patients. Median systolic blood pressure was significantly higher in deceased patients (137.0 mm Hg) than recovered patients (125.0 mm Hg). More patients who died than who recovered had arterial pressure of 140 mm Hg or higher (50 (44%) v 33 (20%)). Heart rates were much higher in deceased patients (101.0 beats per minute) than in recovered patients (91.0 beats per minute). Respiratory rates were significantly higher in deceased patients (24.0 breaths per minute) than in recovered patients (20.0 breaths per minute). Deceased patients more often developed tachycardia and tachypnoea (respiratory rate &gt;=24 breaths per minute) (56 (50%) and 66 (58%)) than did recovered patients (48 (30%) and 22 (14%)). Seventy two (64%) deceased patients and only 19 (12%) who recovered had percutaneous oxygen saturation of 93% or below on admission.\nLaboratory parameters of deceased patients and recovered patients\nWe observed substantial differences in laboratory findings between patients who died of covid-19 and those who recovered from it (table 2). Fifty six (50%) deceased patients and only six (4%) who recovered developed leukocytosis (white blood cell count &gt;=10x109/L). Deceased patients had persistent and more severe lymphopenia than recovered patients; 44 (39%) deceased patients and eight (5%) recovered patients had lymphocyte counts below 0.5x109/L. Median platelet counts were significantly lower in deceased patients.\nLaboratory findings on admission of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 who died and recovered patients.

and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase were markedly higher in deceased patients than in recovered patients. Fifty nine (52%) deceased patients and 25 (16%) who recovered had abnormal aspartate aminotransferase concentrations (&gt;40 U/L). Albumin concentrations were significantly lower in deceased patients than in recovered patients. Seventy four (65%) deceased patients and 22 (14%) recovered patients developed hypoalbuminaemia (albumin &lt;32 g/L). Concentrations of blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, potassium, triglycerides, creatine kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase were significantly higher in deceased patients than in recovered patients. Concentrations of hypersensitive cardiac troponin I and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide were markedly higher in deceased patients (40.8 pg/mL and 800.0 pg/mL) than in recovered patients (3.3 pg/mL and 72.0 pg/mL), with eight deceased patients having cardiac troponin I above 1000 pg/mL and two above 10 000 pg/mL. In addition, deceased patients more often had increased cardiac troponin I and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide concentrations (68/94 (72%) and 68/80 (85%)) than did recovered patients (15/109 (14%) and 17/93 (18%)).\nMedian prothrombin time was significantly longer in deceased patients than in recovered patients, whereas activated partial thromboplastin time was comparable between the two groups. D-dimer concentrations were markedly greater in deceased patients (4.6 mug/mL) than in recovered patients (0.6 mug/mL). Thirty four (35%) of 97 deceased patients and only three (2%) of 150 recovered patients had D-dimer concentrations above 21mug/mL. Concentrations of procalcitonin, high sensitivity C-reactive protein, and ferritin, as well as erythrocyte sedimentation rate, were significantly higher in deceased patients than in recovered patients. Thirty five (36%) of 96 deceased patients and three (2%) of 140 recovered patients had procalcitonin of 0.5 ng/mL or higher. Thyroid stimulating hormone and free triiodothyronine concentrations were significantly lower in deceased patients (0.7 mIU/mL and 2.8 pmol/L) than in recovered patients (1.4 mIU/mL and 4.3 pmol/L). Serum circulating immunoglobulin A, immunoglobulin G, and immunoglobulin M did not differ significantly between the two groups, whereas complement 3 and complement 4 concentrations were markedly lower in deceased patients than in recovered patients.\nOf patients with available data, concentrations of interleukin 2 receptor, interleukin 6, interleukin 8, interleukin 10, and tumour necrosis factor alpha were significantly higher in deceased patients than in recovered patients. Deceased patients more often had increased concentrations of interleukin 2 receptor, interleukin 6, interleukin 8, interleukin 10, and tumour necrosis factor alpha than did recovered patients. Most (48/53; 91%) deceased patients had undetectable concentrations of interleukin 1beta. Forty two (86%) of 49 deceased patients and 58 (50%) of 117 recovered patients had proteinuria, and 40 (82%) of 49 deceased patients and 44 (38%) of 117 recovered patients showed microscopic haematuria.\nOn admission, abnormalities on chest radiographs were seen in all patients (fig 1); 113 (100%) deceased patients and 152 (94%) recovered patients had bilateral involvement on chest radiographs. Typical findings on chest computed tomography images on admission of deceased patients showed bilateral ground glass opacity and subsegmental areas of consolidation (fig 1, A and C), which then progressed rapidly with mass shadows of high density in both lungs (fig 1, B and D). Representative chest computed tomography images of recovered patients showed right middle lobe and lower lobe ground glass opacity and consolidation (fig 1, E and F); then bilateral ground glass opacity and bilateral consolidation of the lungs progressed but right middle lobe consolidation resolved (fig 1, G). Follow-up images showed obviously resolved bilateral ground glass opacity and consolidation (fig 1, H).\nRepresentative chest computed tomographic images of patients with covid-19 who died and patients who recovered. A-D are chest computed tomograms showing axial view lung window from two deceased patients. Case 1 was a 57 year old women, and case 2 was a 53 year old man. E-H are chest computed tomograms images from a 33 year old woman who recovered. A: image obtained on day 10 after symptom onset shows multiple ground glass opacities and consolidation in bilateral lungs. B: image obtained on day 18 after symptom onset shows progressive multiple ground glass opacities and consolidation in bilateral lungs. C: image obtained on day 9 after symptom onset shows multiple ground glass opacities in bilateral lungs and solid nodule in right lower lobe. D: image obtained on day 13 after symptom onset shows progressive ground glass opacities in bilateral lungs and decreased density of solid nodule in right lower lobe. E: image obtained on day 4 after symptom onset shows right middle lobe and lower lobe consolidation and ground glass opacities. F: image obtained on day 7 after symptom onset shows progressive right middle lobe and lower lobe consolidation and ground glass opacities. G: image obtained on day 11 after symptom onset shows progressive multiple ground glass opacities and consolidation in bilateral lungs and decreased density and range of right middle lobe consolidation. H: after 17 days' therapy, follow-up computed tomograms show ground glass opacities, and consolidation are obviously resolved in bilateral lungs\nArterial blood gases were measured in 35 deceased patients and 32 recovered patients (table 3). Five (14%) deceased patients and 3 (9%) recovered patients had pH below 7.35, whereas 14 (40%) deceased patients and five (16%) recovered patients had pH 7.45 or above. The median arterial partial pressure of oxygen in deceased patients was 59.2 mm Hg, which was significantly lower than that of recovered patients (121.0 mm Hg). Eighteen of 35 deceased patients and none who recovered had arterial partial pressure of oxygen below 60 mmHg, and all of these had partial pressure of carbon dioxide below 50 mmHg, indicating that they had type I respiratory failure. The median arterial partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio was significantly lower in deceased patients (105.1) than in recovered patients (350.0). Moreover, all the deceased patients and 14 (44%) recovered patients had an arterial partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio of 300, indicating that these patients had developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, whereas severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (&lt;=100) developed only in deceased patients (16; 46%). Actual bicarbonate and total carbon dioxide concentration were markedly lower in deceased patients than in recovered patients.\nBlood gas analysis of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 who died and recovered patients.

Common complications observed in deceased patients included acute respiratory distress syndrome (113; 100%), type I respiratory failure (18/35; 51%), sepsis (113; 100%), acute cardiac injury (72/94; 77%), heart failure (41/83; 49%), shock (46; 41%), alkalosis (14/35; 40%), hyperkalaemia (42; 37%), acute kidney injury (28; 25%), and hypoxic encephalopathy (23; 20%). These were significantly more frequent than in recovered patients, showing their potential association with the clinical outcome. Less common complications in deceased patients included acidosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and acute liver injury. One patient who died developed gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with cardiovascular comorbidities were more likely to develop acute cardiac injury and heart failure. In addition, although more deceased patients had chronic hypertension, among patients with available data regardless of history of coexisting cardiovascular disease, cardiac complications were more frequent in deceased patients than in recovered patients.\nComplications and treatments of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 who died and recovered patients.

Invasive mechanical ventilation was needed in 17 (15%) deceased patients, one of whom received extracorporeal membrane pulmonary oxygenation as rescue therapy. Three deceased patients received continuous renal replacement therapy.\nDiscussion\nOur study comprehensively described the major differences in clinical features between the patients who died of covid-19 and those who recovered from it. The median age of deceased patients was significantly older than that of recovered patients. Male sex was more predominant in patients who died than in those who recovered. Chronic hypertension and other cardiovascular comorbidities were more frequent among deceased patients than recovered patients. Symptoms related to hypoxemia were more common in deceased patients than in recovered patients. Deceased patients more often developed systematic inflammation and multi-organ dysfunction than did recovered patients. The indicators of cardiac injury showed more frequent or prominent abnormalities in deceased patients than in recovered patients. The information provided will further enrich knowledge about this critical disease and may consequently help to improve patients' outcomes and lower the fatality rate.\nComparison with other studies\nThe clinical spectrum of covid-19 varies widely, ranging from an asymptomatic infection to severe and critical pneumonia with high fatality rates. The Chinese Centers for Disease Control recently reported that most of the confirmed cases were classified as mild or moderate, 13.8% as severe, and only 4.7% as critically ill. The overall fatality rate for confirmed covid-19 cases was found to be higher in male than in female patients, with the risk of death rising with age for both sexes. The highest fatality rate was in people aged 80 and above.\nThe overall mortality rate of covid-19 is much lower than for severe acute respiratory syndrome (10%) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (30%).  However, covid-19 has ultimately proven more deadly as it has spread to many more people globally than did the others, owing to rapid person to person transmission and atypical symptoms at an early stage in certain patients.  Here, we report a relatively high mortality rate for covid-19 of up to 14.1%, which is higher than in recent reports. This is partly due to a large proportion of severely or critically ill patients admitted to Tongji Hospital, one of the designated hospitals for severe covid-19, and to the medical resource limitations at the beginning of the covid-19 outbreak. These resources were improved by early February, with prompt supply of medics and medical necessities from across the nation to Wuhan. \nIn accordance with the recent reports on characteristics of patients with covid-19 who needed management in intensive care units,   advanced age (&gt;60), male sex, and comorbidities (particularly hypertension) are believed to be risk factors for severe disease and death from SARS-Cov-2 infection. Thus, early vigilant monitoring along with high quality supportive care are needed in patients at high risk. It is notable that healthcare workers as well as close contacts of previously confirmed patients were likely to have a good outcome, which is consistent with the relatively low fatality rate (0.3%) reported in healthcare workers. This could be explained by the fact that in our study the median age of the healthcare workers was much younger than that of the remaining patients (data not shown). It could also be partly due to the lower mortality observed in the second generation of SARS-Cov-2 infection, as well as to the early awareness of potential infection in that scenario meaning that people would seek medical care or start treatment promptly. Furthermore, the time from onset of symptoms to hospital admission was longer in deceased patients, as some of them had been in a critical condition before being transferred from other healthcare units to Tongji Hospital. This highlights the need to develop community awareness about prompt seeking of medical care and earlier referral to the intensive care unit for high risk populations.\nThe incidence of symptoms including fever, cough, fatigue, anorexia, myalgia, and diarrhoea did not differ significantly between deceased patients and recovered patients, whereas dyspnoea, chest tightness, and disorders of consciousness were more common in those who died. Moreover, the vital signs data showed that most deceased patients had tachycardia and/or tachypnoea as well as pulse oxygen saturation of 93% or lower. These signs and symptoms indicated that most deceased patients had been in a severe or critical condition on admission, and the onset of certain symptoms may help physicians to identify the patients at risk of a poor outcome.\nThe differences in abnormalities of laboratory findings between the deceased patients and the survivors were substantial. Most of the deceased patients and only a few recovered patients developed leukocytosis, and one third of deceased patients and only few who recovered had procalcitonin above 0.5 ng/mL, indicating that a large proportion of deceased patients might have had secondary bacterial infection, which could be strongly associated with death. Deceased patients had persistent and more severe lymphopenia compared with recovered patients, suggesting that a cellular immune deficiency state was associated with poor prognosis. In addition, other common laboratory abnormalities in deceased patients included coagulation disorder (elevation of prothrombin time and D-dimer), impaired liver and kidney function (mild or moderate elevation of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine and frequent hypoalbuminaemia, haematuria, and albuminuria), electrolyte disturbance (hyperkalaemia and hypernatraemia), elevated inflammatory markers (high sensitivity C-reactive protein, ferritin, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate), and cytokine storm. Most notably, markedly higher concentrations of creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, cardiac troponin I, and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide were seen in deceased patients than in recovered patients. Increase in cardiac troponin I and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide was much more frequent and significant than that in the recent reports,  likely owing to the relatively small number of deceased patients and more patients at earlier stages of the disease included in those studies.\nIn the later stages of the disease, patients who die may develop pulmonary and extrapulmonary organ damage, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, type I respiratory failure, sepsis, acute cardiac injury, heart failure, acute kidney injury, hypoxic encephalopathy, shock, acidosis or alkalosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and acute liver injury, although the last two complications were less frequent. Development of respiratory, cardiac, and neurological complications is strongly associated with poor outcome in patients with covid-19. Patients with cardiovascular comorbidities were more likely to develop cardiac complications. Cardiac complications were frequent not only in deceased patients with cardiovascular comorbidities but also in those without cardiovascular comorbidities, suggesting that the high risk of cardiac complications in deceased patients could not be entirely ascribed to coexisting cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, in addition to acute respiratory distress syndrome and respiratory failure, acute cardiac injury and heart failure could be major factors contributing to the fatality risk of covid-19 regardless of history of previous cardiovascular disease. However, the pathological report of covid-19 associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome at present shows that pulmonary oedema with hyaline membrane formation in the lungs, but no obvious histological changes in heart tissue, was identified from one single case report. This suggests that the underlying mechanism of cardiac injury needs further exploration. The median time from onset of symptoms to death in deceased patients was 16 days, and the median time from first symptoms to discharge in recovered patients was 26 days. In covid-19, the evolution of pulmonary and systemic inflammation in the first two weeks may determine the physiological progression (resolving or progressing) and outcome of disease (death or survival).\nTo date, no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for covid-19 has proven to be effective, so supportive therapy that eases the symptoms and protects important organs may be most beneficial. In this study, for patients without second bacterial infection, empirical antimicrobial treatment seemed to be ineffective. Fewer deceased patients than recovered received antiviral monotherapy or combination antiviral therapy, as well as interferon alpha inhalation treatment. Considering the severe pneumonia and &quot;cytokine storm&quot; observed in deceased patients, more of these patients were given glucocorticoid therapy than recovered patients. Because of hypoxaemia, significantly more deceased patients than recovered received ventilation. We cannot conclude from this study which antivirals given at the right time would be beneficial, or whether steroid use would be beneficial, for patients with covid-19; further investigation is needed.\nSubstantial similarities exist between covid-19 and severe acute respiratory syndrome, from the virus homology to the potential origin, main transmission route (respiratory droplets), identified receptor (angiotensin converting enzyme 2), clinical manifestation, and disease dynamics. Risk factors for severe covid-19 or severe acute respiratory syndrome outcomes are old age and comorbidities. Progression for patients with severe disease follows a similar pattern for both viruses. Although both viruses can cause severe and even lethal lower respiratory tract infection and extrapulmonary manifestations, myocardial injury and heart failure are more frequently reported in patients with covid-19, indicating a unique pathophysiology. These findings will alert clinicians to pay special attention not only to the development of respiratory dysfunction but also to the signs of cardiac complications.\nLimitations of study\nOur study has several limitations. Firstly, almost all the deceased patients were classified as being severely or critically ill, whereas a large proportion of recovered patients might be classified as having moderate disease. This patient setting reflects the real world situation where most confirmed cases are mild or moderate. Nevertheless, the high incidence of cardiac complications in deceased patients is of great importance, raising awareness of the need for earlier monitoring and cardiac supportive care. Secondly, nearly a third of deceased patients developed disorders of consciousness on admission, ranging from somnolence to deep coma, which may result in a loss of some information (particularly a detailed history and subjective symptoms). Additionally, some laboratory tests (for example, cardiac troponin I, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, and arterial blood gas tests) were not done in all the patients, and missing data or important tests might lead to bias of clinical characteristics. Thirdly, the median length of hospital admission before death was about five days, information on the dynamic changes in laboratory variables in deceased patients was lacking, and the data collected for each patient on admission may have been from different disease stages. Therefore, further study is warranted to gain a better understanding of risk factors for and outcome of covid-19, which ultimately may help to guide efforts aimed at reducing the fatality rate.\nConclusions and policy implications\nCertain patients with covid-19, particularly those with advanced age and hypertension, were in a critical condition on admission and progressed rapidly to death within two to three weeks from disease onset. SARS-Cov-2 infection can cause both pulmonary and systemic inflammation, leading to multi-organ dysfunction in high risk populations. In addition to acute respiratory distress syndrome and type I respiratory failure, acute cardiac injury and heart failure may also contribute to the critical illness state associated with high mortality, which highlights the importance of earlier cardiac monitoring and supportive care in such patients.\nWhat is already known on this topic\nAs of 28 February 2020, more than 2858 people had died of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), with the highest mortality rate of 4.5% in Wuhan, China\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) infection causes clusters of severe and even fatal pneumonia\nClinical characteristics of patients with covid-19 who died have not been fully elucidated yet\nWhat this study adds\nCertain patients with covid-19, particularly those with advanced age and hypertension, were in a critical condition on admission and progressed rapidly to death within two to three weeks from disease onset\nSARS-Cov-2 infection can cause both pulmonary and systemic inflammation, leading to multi-organ dysfunction in high risk populations\nIn addition to acute respiratory distress syndrome and type I respiratory failure, acute cardiac injury and heart failure may also contribute to the critical illness state associated with high mortality\nExtra material supplied by authors\nContributors: TC, DW, HLC, WMY, DLY, and GC contributed equally to this paper, as did KM, DX, HJY, HWW, and TW.

others.\n Subsequently, in what became known as the 20/80 rule, a small percentage of individuals within any population was observed to control most transmission events.\n This empirical rule was shown to govern inter-individual transmission dynamics for many pathogens in several species, and individuals who infect disproportionately more secondary contacts, as compared to most others, became known as super-spreaders.\n Studies conducted in the wake of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic revealed that, in the absence of super-spreading events, most individuals infect few, if any, secondary contacts.\n The analysis of SARS transmission, and reports from other outbreaks, unveil a complex scenario in which super-spreading events are shaped by multiple factors, including co-infection with another pathogen, immune suppression, changes in airflow dynamics, delayed hospital admission, misdiagnosis, and inter-hospital transfers.\n Predicting and identifying super-spreaders open significant medical and public health challenges, and represent important facets of infectious disease management and pandemic preparedness

Evidence for Bats as the Evolutionary Source of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","abstract":"The evolutionary origins of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are unknown.\n Current evidence suggests that insectivorous bats are likely to be the original source, as several 2c CoVs have been described from various species in the family Vespertilionidae.\n Here, we describe a MERS-like CoV identified from a Pipistrellus cf.\n hesperidus bat sampled in Uganda (strain PREDICT/PDF-2180), further supporting the hypothesis that bats are the evolutionary source of MERS-CoV.\n Phylogenetic analysis showed that PREDICT/PDF-2180 is closely related to MERS-CoV across much of its genome, consistent with a common ancestry; however, the spike protein was highly divergent (46% amino acid identity), suggesting that the two viruses may have different receptor binding properties.\n Indeed, several amino acid substitutions were identified in key binding residues that were predicted to block PREDICT/PDF-2180 from attaching to the MERS-CoV DPP4 receptor.\n To experimentally test this hypothesis, an infectious MERS-CoV clone expressing the PREDICT/PDF-2180 spike protein was generated.\n Recombinant viruses derived from the clone were replication competent but unable to spread and establish new infections in Vero cells or primary human airway epithelial cells.\n Our findings suggest that PREDICT/PDF-2180 is unlikely to pose a zoonotic threat.\n Recombination in the S1 subunit of the spike gene was identified as the primary mechanism driving variation in the spike phenotype and was likely one of the critical steps in the evolution and emergence of MERS-CoV in humans.\n","id":"PMC5380844","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"American

SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) replication in the respiratory tract and are available in sufficient numbers for statistical evaluation.\n They are relatively inexpensive and easily accessible, but their use in SARS research is limited because they do not develop illness following infection.\n Older (12- to 14-mo-old) BALB/c mice develop clinical illness and pneumonitis, but they can be hard to procure, and immune senescence complicates pathogenesis studies.\n We adapted the SARS-CoV (Urbani strain) by serial passage in the respiratory tract of young BALB/c mice.\n Fifteen passages resulted in a virus (MA15) that is lethal for mice following intranasal inoculation.\n Lethality is preceded by rapid and high titer viral replication in lungs, viremia, and dissemination of virus to extrapulmonary sites accompanied by lymphopenia, neutrophilia, and pathological changes in the lungs.\n Abundant viral antigen is extensively distributed in bronchial epithelial cells and alveolar pneumocytes, and necrotic cellular debris is present in airways and alveoli, with only mild and focal pneumonitis.\n These observations suggest that mice infected with MA15 die from an overwhelming viral infection with extensive, virally mediated destruction of pneumocytes and ciliated epithelial cells.\n The MA15 virus has six coding mutations associated with adaptation and increased virulence; when introduced into a recombinant SARS-CoV, these mutations result in a highly virulent and lethal virus (rMA15), duplicating the phenotype of the biologically derived MA15 virus.\n Intranasal inoculation with MA15 reproduces many aspects of disease seen in severe human cases of SARS.\n The availability of the MA15 virus will enhance the use of the mouse model for SARS because infection with MA15 causes morbidity, mortality, and pulmonary pathology.\n This virus will be of value as a stringent challenge in evaluation of the efficacy of vaccines and antivirals.\n","id":"PMC1769406","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

of MERS in South Korea.\n Deep-sequencing analysis of MERS-CoV genomes performed on specimens from eight patients revealed significant intrapatient variation; therefore, sequence heterogeneity was further analyzed using targeted deep sequencing.\n A total of 35 specimens from 24 patients (including a super-spreader) were sequenced to detect and analyze variants displaying intrapatient heterogeneity.\n Based on the analysis of nonconsensus sequences, we demonstrated the intrapatient heterogeneity of MERS-CoVs, with the highest level in the super-spreader specimen.\n The heterogeneity could be transmitted in a close association with variation in the consensus sequences, suggesting the occurrence of multiple MERS-CoV infections.\n Analysis of intrapatient heterogeneity revealed a relationship between D510G and I529T mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike glycoprotein.\n These two mutations have been reported to reduce the affinity of the RBD for human CD26.

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.\n\n Increasing quartile of NLR was statistically significantly associated with secondary outcome.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR is associated with outcomes in unselected critically ill patients.\n\n In patients with sepsis, there was no statistically significant relationship between NLR and mortality.\n\n Further investigation is required to increase understanding of the

2019-nCoV).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like

presenting between 12 January 2020 to 6 February 2020. Patients with severe respiratory distress and/ or oxygen requirement at any time during the disease course were excluded.\n\n Repeat Chest CT was obtained at approximately 4 day intervals.\n\n The total CT score was the sum of lung involvement (5 lobes, score 1-5 for each lobe, range, 0 none, 25 maximum) was determined.\n\n\nResults\nTwenty one patients (6 males and 15 females, age 25-63 years) with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated.\n\n These patients under went a total of 82 pulmonary CT scans with a mean interval of 41 days (range: 1-8 days).\n\n All patients were discharged after a mean hospitalized period of 174 days (range: 11-26 days).\n\n Maximum lung involved peaked at approximately 10 days (with the calculated total CT score of 6) from the onset of initial symptoms (R2=0.25), p&lt;0.001).\n\n Based on quartiles of patients from day 0 to day 26 involvement, 4 stages of lung CT were defined: Stage 1 (0-4 days): ground glass opacities (GGO) in 18/24 (75%) patients with the total CT score of 22; (2)Stage-2 (5-8d days): increased crazy-paving pattern 9/17 patients (53%) with a increase in total CT score (64, p=0.002); (3) Stage-3 (9-13days): consolidation 19/21 (91%) patients with the peak of total CT score (74); (4) Stage-4 (?14 days): gradual resolution of consolidation 15/20 (75%) patients with a decreased total CT score (64) without crazy-paving pattern.\n\n\nConclusion\nIn patients recovering from COVID-19 pneumonia (without severe respiratory distress during the disease course), lung abnormalities on chest CT showed greatest severity approximately 10 days after initial onset of symptoms.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7233367","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Radiological Society of North America","authors":[{"firstname":"Feng","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tianhe","surname":"Ye","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Tianhe","surname":"Ye","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shan","surname":"Gui","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Shan","surname":"Gui","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Liang","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Liang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lingli","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Lingli","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dandan","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Dandan","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiazheng","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Jiazheng","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Richard L.","surname":"Hesketh","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Richard L.","surname":"Hesketh","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lian","surname":"Yang","email":"yanglian@hust.edu.cn","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Lian","surname":"Yang","email":"yanglian@hust.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chuansheng","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chuansheng","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1093/jtm/taaa020","date":"2020-02-10","title":"Isolation, quarantine, social distancing and community containment: pivotal role for old-style public health measures in the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak","abstract":"Public health measures were decisive in controlling the SARS epidemic in 2003.

in confined spaces with relative homogeneous mixing.\n\n On 3 February, 2020, an outbreak of COVID-19 on cruise ship Diamond Princess was reported with 10 initial cases, following an index case on board around 21-25th January.\n\n By 4th February, public health measures such as removal and isolation of ill passengers and quarantine of non-ill passengers were implemented.\n\n By 20th February, 619 of 3700 passengers and crew (17%) were tested positive.\n\n\nMethods\nWe estimated the basic reproduction number from the initial period of the outbreak using SEIR models.\n\n We calibrated the models with transient functions of countermeasures to incidence data.\n\n We additionally estimated a counterfactual scenario in absence of countermeasures, and established a model stratified by crew and guests to study the impact of differential contact rates among the groups.\n\n We also compared scenarios of an earlier versus later evacuation of the ship.\n\n\nResults\nThe basic reproduction rate was initially 4 times higher on-board compared to the \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\usepackage{amsmath}\n\usepackage{wasysym} \n\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\usepackage{amssymb}

The calibration plots also showed good consistency between the prediction and the observation.\nInterpretation\nThe proposed nomogram accurately predicted clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19 based on individual characteristics. Earlier identification, more intensive surveillance, and appropriate therapy should be considered in patients at high risk.\nSince December 2019, China has been experiencing an outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It has become the newest global health threat, and &gt; 800,000 people have been infected. Europe and the United State have become the epicenters of COVID-19, with a total of 464,212 and 163,199 confirmed cases as of April 1, 2020, respectively. Severe cases can develop adverse outcomes, and the numbers of death are persistently increasing outside of China. The case fatal ratio in Italy was up to 11.7%.\nAs the pandemic evolves, it is urgent that the risk factors associated with fatal outcomes be identified. Earlier intensive surveillance or treatment could then be performed to save lives. Previous reports have described the clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19, and differences between subjects with mild and severe disease were compared. Nonetheless, these previous studies have limitations, including relatively small sample sizes, single-center observations, and use of the univariate analysis alone. Independent predicted factors of fatal outcome remain uncertain. It has also been suggested that the use of a single risk factor could not thoroughly estimate the comprehensive clinical outcome of individual patients. Therefore, based on a national cohort, the current study attempted to investigate the potential risk factors associated with fatality by using a multivariate Cox regression analysis and a nomogram model.\nPatients and Methods\nStudy Patients\nLed by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, a retrospective cohort to study COVID-19 admitted cases from 575 hospitals throughout China was established. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was made based on the World Health Organization interim guidance. The diagnosis was confirmed by a positive result of real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay or high-throughput sequencing findings from nasal or pharyngeal swab specimens. By the cutoff time of January 31, 2020, a total of 2,007 cases diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were collected, and 417 cases were excluded because of incomplete medical records.\nThe study was approved by the ethics commission of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University (Institutional Review Board: 202092). Due to the urgent need to collect data on this emerging infectious disease, the requirement for written informed consent was waived.\nDesign and Data Extraction\nAfter careful medical chart review, clinical data (including epidemiologic history, demographic data, clinical symptoms and signs, comorbidities, radiologic assessments, laboratory findings upon admission, treatments, and clinical outcome) were extracted from electronic medical records. Laboratory assessments consisted of CBC, blood chemistry, coagulation test, liver and renal function, electrolytes, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin (PCT), lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase. All medical records were copied and sent to the data-processing center in Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, under the coordination of the National Health Commission. A team of experienced respiratory clinicians reviewed and abstracted the data, and data were entered into a computerized database and cross-checked. The primary end point of outcome was death. Independent predicted factors associated with the fatal outcome were investigated.\nStatistical Analysis\nContinuous variables are described by using mean +- SD or median (interquartile range). Categorical variables are described as number (percentage). Statistical comparisons between continuous variables were performed with an independent Student t test for normally distributed data; otherwise, the Mann-Whitney U test was performed. The chi2 test and Fisher exact test were applied to categorical variables as appropriate. Survival curves were plotted by using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by using the log-rank test.\nCox regression analysis was used for univariate and multivariate analyses. To estimate risk factors associated with fatal outcome, variables (including baseline characteristics and laboratory findings) were assessed by using univariate Cox regression analyses. A final model selection was performed via a backward stepdown selection process with the Akaike information criterion. A nomogram was built based on the results of multivariate analysis and through the rms package in R version 3.3.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing; http://www.r-project.org/). The maximum score of each variable was set as 100. The performance of the nomogram was measured based on the Harrell concordance index (C-index). The nomogram was also evaluated by comparing between nomogram-predicted and observed Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival probability. Bootstraps of 1,000 resamples were set, and calibration curves were calculated by using regression analysis. All statistical analysis was performed by using R version 3.3.1. P values &lt; .05 were considered statistically significant.\nResults\nA-C, Clinical characteristics of 50 fatal cases with coronavirus disease 2019. The percentages of coexisting chronic illness in fatal cases (A), treatments in fatal cases (B), and complications in fatal cases (C). ARF = acute renal failure; CRRT = continuous renal replacement therapy; DIC = disseminated intravascular coagulation; ECMO = extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; IMV = invasive mechanical ventilation; NIV = noninvasive ventilation.\nOf the 1,590 cases included in this cohort, 50 deaths were reported by January 31, 2020. The median age of fatal cases was 69 years (range, 51-86 years); 30 of these subjects were male. The median duration from initial treatment to death was 11 days (interquartile range, 7-16.5 days). Thirty-five (70%) cases reported one or more co-existing illness: 28 (56.0%) with hypertension, 13 (26.0%) with diabetes, eight (16.0%) with coronary heart disease (CHD), six (12.0%) with cerebrovascular disease (CVD), six (12.0%) with COPD, and five (10.0%) with renal disease (Fig 1 A). The most common symptoms since disease onset were fever (87.5%), cough (77.1%), and dyspnea (74.0%). The incidence of dyspnea in fatal cases was higher than that in nonfatal cases (19.1%; P &lt; .001). Other symptoms included fatigue, headache, myalgia, nausea or vomiting, diarrhea, and chills (e-Table 1).\nOn admission, the following abnormalities of laboratory findings were observed in the fatal cases: lymphopenia (97.6%), elevated levels of C-reactive protein (100%), lactose dehydrogenase (91.4%), D-dimer (87.2%), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (68.6%), alanine aminotransferase (54.3%), leukocytes (42.5%), PCT (41.2%), and total bilirubin (39.0%). Compared with nonfatal cases, more prominent laboratory abnormalities and abnormal chest radiographs were observed in fatal cases (ie, leukopenia, lymphopenia, elevated C-reactive protein, PCT, lactose dehydrogenase, AST, alanine aminotransferase, total bilirubin, creatine kinase, creatinine, D-dimer level) according to univariate analysis (e-Table 1).\nAll patients with fatal outcomes had received antibiotic therapy. Antifungal therapy was administered to 22%; 36.1% of patients received oseltamivir; and 56.3% received systemic glucocorticoids. Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) were performed in 68.8% and 62.5% of cases, respectively. The median age of fatal cases who received NIV and IMV were 69 years (range, 53-84 years) and 66 years (range, 51-82 years). Overall, 10.8% of cases were given extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, 21.1% with continuous renal replacement therapy. ARDS, secondary infection, and septic shock were the most commonly reported complications (Fig 1B, 1C). e-Figure 1 shows the progression of a 63-year-old patient with a fatal outcome.\nRisk factor of the fatal outcome in the multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model.

Age &gt;= 75 years (hazard ratio [HR], 7.86; 95% CI, 2.44-25.35), age between 65 and 74 years (HR, 3.43; 95% CI, 1.24-9.5), CHD (HR, 4.28; 95% CI,1.14-16.13), CVD (HR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.07-8.94), dyspnea (HR, 3.96; 95% CI,1.42-11), PCT &gt; 0.5 ng/mL (HR, 8.72; 95% CI, 3.42-22.28), AST &gt; 40 U/L (HR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.1-6.73) were independent risk factors associated with fatal outcomes (Fig 2 ). The univariate Cox analysis of risk factors related to the fatal outcome is shown in e-Table 2. Kaplan-Meier survival plots for these prognostic factors are shown in Figure 3 .\nPrognostic nomogram for predicting the overall survival probability of patients with coronavirus disease 2019. Prognostic patient's value is located on each variable axis, and a line is drawn upward to determine the number of point nomogram for predicting overall survival probability of patients with coronavirus disease 2019. The sum of these numbers is located on the Total Points axis, and a line is drawn downward to the survival axes to determine the likelihood of 14-day, 21-day, and 28-day survival. See Figure 2 legend for expansion of abbreviations.\nCalibration curves of the nomogram predicting OS in patients with coronavirus disease 2019. Calibration curves of the nomogram predict 14-day (A), 21-day (B), and 28-day (C) OS in patients with coronavirus disease 2019. Nomogram-predicted probability of OS is plotted on the x-axis; actual OS is plotted on the y-axis. OS = overall survival.\nThe nomogram was constructed based on the final multivariate model. To calculate 14-, 21-, and 28-day overall survival probability, we first identified each factor based on the points scale at the top of the nomogram and then summed the points of each factor. Finally, the 14-, 21-, and 28-day overall survival probability was obtained based on the bottom point scale of the nomogram (Fig 4 ). The calibration plots on bootstrap resampling validation are shown in Figure 5 . The C-index for prediction of overall survival was 0.91 (95% CI, 0.85-0.97), indicating that the nomogram is consistent with the actual observation for patients with COVID-19.\nDiscussion\nOur study unraveled the clinic features and risk factors for fatal outcome in subjects with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 based on a national cohort. By January 31, 2020, the National Health Commission had documented 11,791 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in China. The current cohort represents 13.5% of infected patients and is able to provide a more panoramic picture regarding the fatal cases with COVID-19.\nIn our study, some independent risk factors for fatal outcome were found by using a multivariate Cox regression analysis. The study first developed a nomogram model to accurately predict clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19 based on individual characteristic risk factors. The prognostic nomogram performed well in predicting survival, supported by the C-index (0.91; 95% CI, 0.85-0.97) and the calibration curve, which is helpful for further understanding and improving clinical strategies against the disease.\nThe overall confirmed case fatality ratio was 3.14% in the current cohort, which resembles that in the March 8, 2020, World Health Organization report (ie, 3.39%). This is lower than the earlier reports from the single site in Wuhan, China.   The difference might be due to the difficulties in performing diagnosis tests for all suspected subjects and insufficient admission for mild patients at the early stage. Although the case fatal ratio is obviously lower than that of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (10%) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (36%), the transmissibility of COVID seems to be much higher. A recent study has found the the novel 2019 coronavirus (SARS coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) spike protein has an approximately 10- to 20-fold higher affinity than SARS-CoV binding to functional host-cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which may be a potential mechanism for the large number of infected people around the world. \nConsistent with previous reports,   the current study indicated that all age groups are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. However, elderly patients have more severe disease and generally have a higher probability of a fatal outcome. Previous reports indicated that elderly people were more commonly critically ill with COVID-19.2-4 Our study showed that advanced age is the strongest risk factor for a fatal outcome. It also found that risk of death was increased 7.86-fold in patients aged &gt;= 75 years and increased 3.43-fold in patients aged between 65 and 74 years, compared with patients aged &lt; 65 years. In the nomogram model, age was the most important predictor for the fatal outcome. Based on a report from the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention that included 44,672 confirmed cases (updated through February 11, 2020), the case-fatality rate reached 14.8% in patients aged &gt;= 80 years (208 of 1,408) and 8.0% in patients aged 70 to 79 years (312 of 3,918). More intensive surveillance is needed in elderly patients. Earlier reports showed that male individuals were more commonly infected, which may be due to a higher probability of occupational exposure.   However, subsequent reports showed an equivalence of sex distribution in infected cases. The current study indicates that sex is not the core factor accounting for death based on the multivariate Cox regression analysis.\nNonsurvivors present with a higher proportion of various coexisting chronic illness in univariate analysis. Previous studies reported similar findings.     CHD and CVD are confirmed to be independent risk factors for death through the multivariate Cox regression analysis and were entered into the nomogram model. As the functional receptor of SARS-CoV-2, ACE2 is mainly expressed not only in lung alveolar type II epithelial cells but also in blood vessels.  ACE2 also serves as a negative regulatory factor for the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) via the ACE2/angiotensin-(1-7) axis. Exhaustion of ACE2 could activate RAS and enhance susceptibility to heart failure or pulmonary edema. SARS-CoV-2 may act similarly as SARS-CoV and result in an overactivation of RAS in patients with preexisting chronic cardiovascular diseases, which leads to a fatal outcome. Although hypertension is common in nonsurvivors, whether RAS inhibitors (ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers) in patients with hypertension is a protector requires further investigation.\nDyspnea at disease onset was reported in 74% of fatal cases, and it was proved to be an independent risk factor for death. With the progression of disease in some cases, hypoxemia would worsen, and ARDS may develop. It is imperative to identify these patients with hypoxemia and provide appropriate intervention. ARDS is the most common complication associated with death, following by secondary infection and septic shock. Pathologic evidence of ARDS in cases of COVID-19 showed obvious desquamation of pneumocytes, hyaline membrane formation, and pulmonary edema, which is similar to that seen in SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infections. In our cohort, NIV and IMV were performed in 68.8% and 62.5% of fatal cases, respectively. Eleven percent of cases were managed with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. There is still controversy regarding the use of the high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) or NIV in patients with ARDS. However, two studies indicated that early application of HFNC or HFNC with prone positioning could be considered as first-line therapy in acute respiratory failure and may help avoid intubation in patients with ARDS.   \nA series of laboratory abnormalities on admission were more common in fatal cases compared with the survivors. Some independent laboratory predictors of the fatal outcome were found via multivariate Cox regression analysis. PCT is a calcitonin propeptide synthesized by C cells of the thyroid gland and released from leukocytes, and it is significantly increased in bacterial infections and sepsis. It has been proved to have a high specificity for bacterial infection and a good correlation with severity of illness. PCT-guided antibiotic stewardship has been shown to reduce antibiotic use, with fewer side effects and an improvement in clinical outcomes. In the nomogram model of the current study, an elevated level of PCT (&gt; 0.5 ng/mL) was a strong reliable predictor for case fatality. The results indicate that secondary bacterial infections at an earlier stage may play an important role in progression of the disease.\nElevated AST (&gt; 40 U/L) levels were also associated with a greater risk for death in the nomogram model. Increased creatinine (&gt;=133 mumol/L) and total bilirubin (&gt; 17.1 mumol/L) levels might be associated with the fatal outcome. Because ACE2 is widely expressed in multiple organs besides the lung, it is possible that SARS-CoV-2 could invade the local tissues and lead to both direct and indirect damage. The ensuing activation of immune response and cytokine storm will also play an important role in organ dysfunction. Overactivation of peripheral T cells, present as increases of CC4+CCR6+Th17 and high cytotoxicity of CD8 T cells, may contribute to immune injury in severe cases of COVID-19. In addition, the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, antivirus agents, antibiotics, and traditional Chinese medicine may be associated with liver and renal injury. These findings call for multidisciplinary cooperation and monitoring of the organ dysfunction.\nThe current study had some limitations. First, in some cases, there was incomplete documentation of the history, symptoms, or laboratory findings in the electronic database, even after making efforts regarding feedback and recollection. Some diagnoses of co-existing illness were from patients' self-reports at admission, which might lead to recall bias. Although the cohort had a broad coverage of all patients and regions, the nonresponse bias cannot be fully excluded. Second, as a retrospective and observational study, we currently could not set up a validation cohort to assess the predictive accuracy due to the urgent timeline of this special situation. However, we used the bootstrap resampling cohort and showed that the C-index is ideal, suggesting the nomogram is a good model for predicting outcomes. Likewise, the calibration curves for survival probability also showed a good consistency between the prediction and the observation.\nConclusions\nCollectively, the current study provides evidence that advanced age, dyspnea, CHD, CVD, and elevated PCT and AST levels are independent risk factors associated with fatal outcome. The nomogram proposed in this study objectively predicted the prognosis of patients with COVID-19. Earlier identification, more intensive surveillance, and appropriate therapy should be considered in these patients at high risk.\nReferences\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) situation report-72\nEpidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study\nWang D, Hu B, Hu C, et al.

coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 490 years (IQR 410580).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 80 days [IQR 50130]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7159299","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 3666 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 36 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 610 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47%

a severe respiratory disease in humans in the Middle East.\n\n The epidemiological profiles of the MERS-CoV infections suggest zoonotic transmission from an animal reservoir to humans.\n\n\nMethods\nThis study was designed to investigate animal herds associated with Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-infected patients in Saudi Arabia, during the last three years (20142016).\n\n Nasal swabs and serum samples from 584 dromedary camels, 39 sheep, 51 goats, and 2 cattle were collected.\n\n Nasal samples from camels, sheep, goats, and cattle were examined by real-time reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) to detect MERS-CoV RNA, and the Anti-MERS ELISA assay was performed to detect camel humeral immune response (IgG) to MERS-CoV S1 antigen infection.\n\n The complete genome sequencing of ten MERS-CoV camel isolates and phylogenetic analysis was performed.\n\n\nResults\nThe data indicated that seventy-five dromedary camels were positive for MERS-CoV RNA; the virus was not detected in sheep, goats, and cattle.\n\n MERS-CoV RNA from infected camels was not detected beyond 2 weeks after the first positive result was detected in nasal swabs obtained from infected camels.\n\n Anti-MERS ELISA assays showed that 70.9% of camels related to human cases had antibodies to MERS-CoV.\n\n The full genome sequences of the ten MERS-CoV camel isolates were identical to their corresponding patients and were grouped together within the larger MERS-CoV sequences cluster for human and camel isolates reported form the Arabian Peninsula.\n\n\nConclusions\nThese findings indicate that camels are a significant reservoir for the maintenance of MERS-CoVs, and they are an important source of human infection with MERS.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102853","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"The Authors.

Peninsula.\n The epidemiology of the virus remains poorly understood, and while case-based and seroepidemiological studies have been employed extensively throughout the epidemic, viral sequence data have not been utilised to their full potential.\n Here, we use existing MERS-CoV sequence data to explore its phylodynamics in two of its known major hosts, humans and camels.\n We employ structured coalescent models to show that long-term MERS-CoV evolution occurs exclusively in camels, whereas humans act as a transient, and ultimately terminal host.\n By analysing the distribution of human outbreak cluster sizes and zoonotic introduction times, we show that human outbreaks in the Arabian peninsula are driven by seasonally varying zoonotic transfer of viruses from camels.\n Without heretofore unseen evolution of host tropism, MERS-CoV is unlikely to become endemic in humans.\n","id":"PMC5777824","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"eLife Sciences Publications,

involved health care workers (HCWs).\n\n We describe the occurrence of an outbreak among HCWs and attempt to characterize at-risk exposures to improve future infection control interventions.\n\n\nMethods\nThis study included an index case and all HCW contacts.\n\n All contacts were screened for MERS-CoV using polymerase chain reaction.\n\n\nResults\nDuring the study period in 2015, the index case was a 30-year-old Filipino nurse who had a history of unprotected exposure to a MERS-CoVpositive case on May 15, 2015, and had multiple negative tests for MERS-CoV.\n\n Weeks later, she was diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis and MERS-CoV infection.\n\n A total of 73 staff were quarantined for 14 days, and nasopharyngeal swabs were taken on days 2, 5, and 12 postexposure.\n\n Of those contacts, 3 (4%) were confirmed positive for MERS-CoV.\n\n An additional 18 staff were quarantined and had MERS-CoV swabs.\n\n A fourth case was confirmed positive on day 12. Subsequent contact investigations revealed a fourth-generation transmission.\n\n Only 7 (4.5%) of the total 153 contacts were positive for MERS-CoV.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe role of HCWs in MERS-CoV transmission is complex.\n\n Although most MERS-CoVinfected HCWs are asymptomatic or have mild disease, fatal infections can occur and HCWs can play a major role in propagating health care facility outbreaks.\n\n This investigation highlights the need to continuously review infection control guidance relating to the role of HCWs in MERS-CoV transmission in health care outbreaks, especially as it relates to the complex questions on definition of risky exposures, who to test, and the frequency of MERS-CoV testing; criteria for who to quarantine and for how long; and clearance and return to active duty criteria.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7115310","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc.

pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 597 (SD 133) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (615%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 311) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (646 years [112] vs 519 years [129]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (135%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 12 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 3666 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 36 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 610 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 490 years (IQR 410580).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 80 days [IQR 50130]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and

are gender related, with more symptoms in males than in females.\n\n However, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood.\n\n In this study, we investigated sex differences in renal vascular responses to angiotensin II (Ang II) administration with and without Ang II type 1 and Mas receptor (AT1R and MasR) antagonists (losartan and A779) in the 2K1C rat model of renovascular hypertension.\n\n \nMethods\n Male and female 2K1C rats were divided into 8 experimental groups (4 of each sex) treated with vehicle, losartan, A779, or A779+losartan.\n\n Responses of mean arterial pressure (MAP), renal blood flow (RBF), and renal vascular resistance (RVR) to Ang II were determined.\n\n \nResults\n In both sexes, the basal MAP, RBF, and RVR were not significantly different between the four groups during the control period.\n\n The Ang II administration decreased RBF and increased RVR in a dose-related manner in both sexes pretreated with vehicle or A779 (Pdose &lt; 0.0001), but in vehicle pretreated groups, RBF and RVR responses were different between male and female rats (Pgroup &lt; 0.05).\n\n AT1R blockade increased RBF and decreased RVR responses to Ang II, and no difference between the sexes was detected.\n\n Coblockades of AT1R and MasR receptors increased RBF response to Ang II significantly in males alone but not in females (Pgroup=0.04).\n\n \nConclusion\n The impact of Ang II on RBF and RVR responses seems to be gender related with a greater effect on males, and this sex difference abolishes by Mas receptor blockade.\n\n However, the paradoxical role of dual losartan and A779 may provide the different receptor interaction in RAS between male and female rats.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7914082","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Hindawi","authors":[{"firstname":"Zahra","surname":"Pezeshki","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mehdi","surname":"Nematbakhsh","email":"nematbakhsh@med.mui.ac.ir","contributions":"6"},{"firstname":"Mehdi","surname":"Nematbakhsh","email":"nematbakhsh@med.mui.ac.ir","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1113/jphysiol.2001.012921","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Differential

vasodilatation.\n However, the effects of supraphysiological levels of estrogen, analogous to those achieved with high-dose estrogen replacement therapy in postmenopausal women, remain unknown.\n Therefore, we pretreated ovariectomized rats with a relatively high dose of estrogen (0.5?mg/kg/week) for two weeks.\n Subsequently, renal hemodynamic responses to intravenous angiotensin II (Ang II, 30300?ng/kg/min) were tested under anesthesia, while renal perfusion pressure was held constant.\n The role of AT2R was examined by pretreating groups of rats with PD123319 or its vehicle.\n Renal blood flow (RBF) decreased in a dose-related manner in response to Ang II.\n Responses to Ang II were enhanced by pretreatment with estradiol.\n For example, at 300?ng?kg?1?min?1, Ang II reduced RBF by 45.7  1.9% in estradiol-treated rats but only by 27.3  5.1% in vehicle-treated rats.\n Pretreatment with PD123319 blunted the response of RBF to Ang II in estradiol-treated rats, so that reductions in RBF were similar to those in rats not treated with estradiol.\n We conclude that supraphysiological levels of estrogen promote AT2R-mediated renal vasoconstriction.\n This mechanism could potentially contribute to the increased risk of cardiovascular disease associated with hormone replacement therapy using high-dose estrogen.\n

vascular resistance (RVR) responses in a dose-related manner (Ptreat &lt; 0.0001).\n\n The greatest responses were found in ovariectomized estradiol-treated rats that received A779 (Pgroup &lt; 0.05) in non-2K1C rats.\n\n Such findings were not detected in 2K1C hypertensive rats.\n\n For example, in estradiol-treated rats that received A779, at 1000?ng/kg/min of Ang II infusion, RBF reduced from 1.6  0.2 to 0.89  0.19?ml/min in non-2K1C rats, and it reduced from 1.6  0.2 to 1.2  0.2?ml/min in 2K1C rats.\n\n \nConclusion\n Hypertension induced by 2K1C may attenuate the role of A779 and estradiol in renal vascular responses to Ang II infusion.\n\n Perhaps, this response can be explained by the reduction of Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1R) expression in the 2K1C hypertensive rats.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7943267","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Hindawi","authors":[{"firstname":"Samira","surname":"Choopani","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mehdi","surname":"Nematbakhsh","email":"nematbakhsh@med.mui.ac.ir","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mehdi","surname":"Nematbakhsh","email":"nematbakhsh@med.mui.ac.ir","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1155/2015/801053","date":"2015-08-12","title":"Role

converting enzyme (ACE)2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas receptor axis, renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is a new complex target for a pharmacological intervention.\n We investigated the expression of RAS components in the heart and kidney during the development of hypertension and its perinatal treatment with losartan in young spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR).\n Expressions of RAS genes were studied by the RT-PCR in the left ventricle and kidney of rats: normotensive Wistar, untreated SHR, SHR treated with losartan since perinatal period until week 9 of age (20mg/kg/day) and SHR treated with losartan only until week 4 of age and discontinued until week 9. In the hypertrophied left ventricle of SHR, cardiac expressions of Ace and Mas were decreased while those of AT1 receptor (Agtr1a) and Ace2 were unchanged.\n Continuous losartan administration reduced LV weight (0.430.02; P&lt;0.05 versus SHR) but did not influence altered cardiac RAS expression.\n Increased blood pressure in SHR (1492 in SHR versus 1092mmHg in Wistar; P&lt;0.05) was associated with a lower renal expressions of renin, Agtr1a and Mas and with an increase in ACE2. Continuous losartan administration lowered blood pressure to control levels (1053mmHg; P&lt;0.05 versus SHR), however, only renal renin and ACE2 were significantly up-regulated (for both P&lt;0.05 versus SHR).\n Conclusively, prevention of hypertension and LV hypertrophy development by losartan was unrelated to cardiac or renal expression of Mas.\n Increased renal Ace2, and its further increase by losartan suggests the influence of locally generated Ang-(1-7) in organ response to the developing hypertension in SHRs.\n","id":"PMC4549047","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley &amp;

Laboratory tests, including blood routine, cytokine profiles and infection markers, were collected from 389 confirmed COVID-19 patients. The included patients were classified into mild (n = 168), severe (n = 169) and critical groups (n = 52). The leukocytes, neutrophils, infection biomarkers [such as C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT) and ferritin] and the concentrations of cytokines [interleukin (IL)-2R, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha] were significantly increased, while lymphocytes were significantly decreased with increased severity of illness. The amount of IL-2R was positively correlated with the other cytokines and negatively correlated with lymphocyte number. The ratio of IL-2R to lymphocytes was found to be remarkably increased in severe and critical patients. IL-2R/lymphocytes were superior compared with other markers for the identification of COVID-19 with critical illness, not only from mild but also from severe illness. Moreover, the cytokine profiles and IL-2R/lymphocytes were significantly decreased in recovered patients, but further increased in disease-deteriorated patients, which might be correlated with the outcome of COVID-19. Lymphopenia and increased levels of cytokines were closely associated with disease severity. The IL-2R/lymphocyte was a prominent biomarker for early identification of severe COVID-19 and predicting the clinical progression of the disease.\nIL-2R/lymphocyte was a superior marker for the identification of severe COVID-19 patients. \nIntroduction\nThe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a new family of coronavirus, can cause severe respiratory infections [1]. The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been recently named as the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization (WHO). Since the first report in December 2019, a severe outbreak caused by SARS-CoV-2 in China has rapidly spread to multiple regions of the world [2, 3, 4]. WHO has defined COVID-19 as a pandemic due to the speed and scale of transmission.\nAmong a total of 81 385 case records reported by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, most COVID-19 patients were classified as mild (81%), 14% were severe and 5% were critical. The overall case-fatality rate (CFR) was 2 3%, and no deaths were reported in mild and severe cases. However, the CFR among critical cases was 49% [5]. Some patients, particularly those of older age and with pre-existing co-morbid conditions, could develop to critical illness, and died of multiple organ failure in a short period of time [5, 6]. Thus, efficient indicators for evaluation of disease severity and clinical progression still need further investigation, which is urgently needed for reducing COVID-19 mortality.\nPrevious studies have shown that many laboratory biomarkers, such as lymphocyte numbers, lactate dehydrogenase and D-dimer, are out of normal ranges in COVID-19 patients [6, 7]. These laboratory biomarkers are routine and are the most available in clinics. Another study compared plasma cytokine levels between patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those not requiring ICU admission, and found that many cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-2, IL-7, IL-10, granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), interferon gamma-inducible protein-10 (IP-10P, chemotactic protein-1 (MCP1), MIP1A and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, had higher levels in ICU patients compared with non-ICU patients [8]. However, available markers for predicting the progression of patients with COVID-19 are limited.\nIn this study, we analyzed the differences of different biomarkers, including blood routine, cytokine profiles, procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein (CRP) and ferritin, among COVID-19 patients with different severity illness. Our data showed that IL-2R/lymphocytes could be used for early identification of severe COVID-19.\nMethods\nPatients\nThis study recruited COVID-19 patients from 24 January to 15 February 2020, admitted at Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China. Patients who had clinical symptoms (fever, cough or shortness of breath) and radiological characteristics (unilateral pneumonia, bilateral pneumonia or ground-glass opacity), and with positive SARS-CoV-2 real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results, were continuously recruited. Patients younger than 18 years were excluded. Symptoms, signs and laboratory tests during the hospital stay were collected. This study was approved by the ethical committee of Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China (grant number: TJ-C20200128, date: 2020-2-12).\nGrouping criteria\nCOVID-19 patients were classified into three groups with different illness severity, according to the guidelines of diagnosis and treatment for COVID-19 made by the Chinese National Health Commission, as follows - (1) mild: patients had typical symptoms and radiological findings; (2) severe: patients met one of the following criteria - respiratory distress (respiration rate &gt;= 30 times/min), blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) &lt;= 93% in the resting state and arterial partial pressure of O2 to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) ratio &lt;= 300 mmHg; and (3) critical: the patients met one of the following criteria - respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, septic shock and/or multiple organ dysfunction or failure needing ICU treatment. Clinical information related to patient classification was collected from the medical records of the patients.\nReal-time RT-PCR\nThroat or nasal-swab specimens from the upper respiratory tract of all patients on admission were collected and maintained in a viral transport medium. Sputum specimens were also collected in some patients. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed using TaqMan one-step RT-PCR kits from Shanghai Huirui Biotechnology Company Ltd and Shanghai BioGerm Medical Biotechnology Company Ltd, both of which were approved by the China Food and Drug Administration. In brief, RNA was extracted from clinical samples with commercial RNA extraction kits. Then, 5 mul of RNA template was used for real-time RT-PCR, which targeted the open reading frame (ORF)1ab and nucleoprotein gene. Conditions for applications of real-time RT-PCR were as follows: 50 C for 15 min and 95 C for 5 min, 45 cycles of amplification at 95 C for 10 s and 55 C for 45 s. The positive COVID-19 real-time RT-PCR result was defined if both ORF1ab and nucleoprotein cycle thresholds were &lt; 35.\nCytokine profile analysis\nSerum samples were collected from the included participants on admission or at the time of disease aggravation. In those who recovered from illness, the serum samples prior to hospital discharge were also collected. The levels of IL-1beta, IL-2R, IL-8, IL-10, and TNF-alpha in serum were measured according to an automatic procedure of a solid-phase two-site chemiluminescent immunometric assay via IMMULITE 1000 Analyzer (Siemens, Munich, Germany). The level of IL-6 was measured using the electrochemiluminescence method (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland).\nStatistical analysis\nThe results are presented as mean +- standard deviation (s.d.). Differences of markers among the three groups were compared by analysis of variance (ANOVA). The differences of markers between different time-points from the same patients were analyzed using the paired Student's t-test. Spearman's rank correlation test for non-parametric data was employed to analyze the relationship between two factors. All statistically significant variables were taken as candidates for multivariable logistic regression analyses, and the regression equation (predictive model) was obtained. The regression coefficients of the predictive model were regarded as the weights for the respective variables and a score for each patient was calculated. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to determine the best threshold value of the laboratory markers for distinguishing critical illness patients from mild or severe illness patients. Area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity were reported. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 6, MedCalc version 11.6 and SPSS version 22.0. Statistical significance was determined as P &lt; 0 05.\nResults\nThis study included 389 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19. The patients were classified into three groups with different severity of illness. The basic characteristics of mild (n = 168), severe (n = 169) and critical (n = 52) patients are shown in Table 1. The ages of severe (64 7 +- 12 2) and critical (65 7 +- 14 2) patients were significantly higher than mild patients (56 6 +- 13 9). The percentage of males was higher than females in severe and critical groups. The most common symptoms at onset of illness were fever, cough, fatigue, expectoration and shortness of breath. Other symptoms were chest distress, diarrhea, muscle ache, headache, nausea and vomiting. More than half the patients had chronic diseases, including hypertension (32 9%), diabetes (10%), cardiovascular (8 2%) diseases and chronic kidney disease (3 3%) (Table 1).\nBaseline characteristics of 389 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia\n 	Total (n = 389)	Mild (n = 168)	Severe (n = 169)	Critical (n = 52)	 	Age (years)	 	 	 	 	 	Mean (s.d.)	61 3 (13 8)	56 7 (13 9)	64 6 (12 2)	65 4 (14 2)	 	Sex	 	 	 	 	 	Male	200 (51 4%)	74 (44%)	94 (55 6%)	32 (61 5%)	 	Female	189 (48 6%)	94 (56%)	75 (44 4%)	20 (38 5%)	 	Signs and symptoms at admission	 	 	 	 	 	Fever	310 (79 7%)	136 (81%)	131 (77 5%)	43 (82 7%)	 	Cough	236 (60 7%)	107 (64%)	102 (60 4%)	27 (51 9%)	 	Fatigue	146 (37 5%)	58 (34 5%)	72 (42 6%)	16 (30 8%)	 	Expectoration	95 (24 4%)	33 (19 6%)	46 (27 2%)	16 (30 8%)	 	Shortness of breath	76 (19 5%)	21 (12 5%)	35 (20 7%)	20 (38 5%)	 	Chest distress	72 (18 5%)	24 (14 3%)	32 (18 9%)	16 (30 8%)	 	Diarrhea	44 (11 3%)	22 (13 1%)	16 (9 5%)	6 (11 5%)	 	Muscle ache	23 (5 9%)	11 (6 5%)	9 (5 3%)	5 (9 6%)	 	Headache	14 (3 7%)	5 (3%)	6 (3 6%)	3 (5 8%)	 	Dizziness	14 (3 7%)	10 6%	3 (1 8%)	1 (1 9%)	 	Nausea and vomiting	12 (3 0%)	4 (2 4%)	6 (3 6%)	2 (3 8%)	 	Pharyngalgia	10 (2 6%)	7 (4 2%)	3 (1 8%)	0	 	Chest pain	10 (2 6%)	5 (3%)	2 (1 2%)	3 (5 8%)	 	Comorbidities	230 (59 1%)	85 (50 6%)	109 (64 5%)	36 (69 2%)	 	Hypertension	128 (32 9%)	44 (26 2%)	63 (37 3%)	21 (40 4%)	 	Diabetes	39 (10%)	16 (9 5%)	19 (11 2%)	4 (7 7%)	 	Cardiovascular disease	32 (8 2%)	15 (8 9%)	12 (7 1%)	5 (9 6%)	 	Chronic kidney disease	13 (3 3%)	4 (2 4%)	7 (4 1%)	2 (3 8%)	 	Cerebrovascular disease	8 (2 1%)	3 (1 8%)	3 (1 8%)	2 (3 8%)	 	Malignancy	4 (1%)	2 (1 2%)	2 (1 2%)	0	 	Chronic liver disease	3 (0 8%)	1 (0 6%)	1 (0 6%)	1 (1 9%)	 	COPD	3 (0 8%)	0	2 (1 2%)	1 (1 9%)	 	\nData are presented as numbers (%) unless otherwise indicated.

We observed that leukocytes, neutrophils, CRP, PCT and ferritin were significantly increased, while lymphocytes were significantly decreased in severe and critical patients compared with mild patients (Fig. 1a,b). These biomarkers also showed statistically significant differences between severe and critical patients. The cytokine profiles, including IL-1beta, IL-2R, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and TNF-alpha on admission, were detected. We found that the cytokine profiles, except IL-1beta, were all significantly increased with increased severity of illness (Fig. 1c). Moreover, the concentration of IL-2R was positively correlated with that of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and TNF-alpha (Fig. 2a-d). We also observed that the amount of IL-2R was negatively correlated with lymphocyte numbers (Fig. 2e). We then further calculated the ratio of IL-2R to lymphocytes and found that the value of IL-2R/lymphocytes was remarkably increased in severe and critical patients compared with mild patients (Fig. 2f).\nBlood cell counts, infectious biomarkers and cytokine profiles in coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) patients.

The normal reference ranges of IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and TNF-alpha were 5, 1 5, 5, 5 and 4 pg/ml, respectively. If the concentrations of the corresponding cytokines were lower than the normal range, we recorded the minimum values.

Results of the test were significant with P &lt; 0 05.\nFor the prediction of severe COVID-19 patients, all statistically significant variables were taken as candidates for further multivariable logistic regression analyses. We found that the increase of IL-2R/lymphocytes, CRP and ferritin were associated with increased odds, and chosen as the prediction model indicators of severe COVID-19. Odds ratios (OR) and their corresponding confidence intervals are shown in Table 2. ROC analysis showed that IL-2R/lymphocytes had a higher AUC (0 948) than CRP (0 886) and ferritin (0 812) to differentiate critical from mild patients. The performance of IL-2R/lymphocytes to distinguish severe from mild patients was poor (Fig. 3a). However, IL-2R/lymphocytes showed a sensitivity of 90 9% and a specificity of 66 5% to differentiate between critical and severe patients (Fig. 3b) and a sensitivity of 94 2% and a specificity of 82 1% in distinguishing critical from mild patients (Fig. 3c).\nMultivariable logistic regression analysis for prediction of severe COVID-19\nParameter	OR	OR (97 5% CI = 2 5%)	P-value	 	IL-1beta	1 0379	0 9739	1 1062	0 2515	 	IL-2R	0 9993	0 9983	1 0004	0 2078	 	IL-6	1 0000	0 9903	1 0097	0 9936	 	IL-8	0 9985	0 9929	1 0041	0 5934	 	IL-10	1 0163	0 9769	1 0573	0 4234	 	TNF-alpha	1 0115	0 9443	1 0834	0 7450	 	Lymphocyte	1 2623	0 7412	2 1499	0 3911	 	Neutrophil	1 0638	0 9467	1 1953	0 2986	 	PCT	2 5333	0 7287	8 8067	0 1437	 	IL-2R/lymphocytes	1 0013	1 0005	1 0021	0 0020	 	CRP	1 0085	1 0008	1 0163	0 0300	 	Ferritin	1 0006	1 0001	1 0010	0 0206	 	\nCOVID-19 = coronavirus disease-2019; OR = odds ratio; CI = confidence interval; PCT = procalcitonin; CRP = C-reactive protein; IL = interleukin; TNF = tumor necrosis factor.\nReceiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showing the performance of the interleukin (IL)-2R/lymphocyte among coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) patients with different severity of illness.\nFurthermore, we monitored the change of lymphocytes and cytokine levels in the disease progression of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. In the 28 recovered patients lymphocyte numbers gradually increased to normal levels, while the levels of IL-2R, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-alpha and IL-2R/lymphocytes were significantly decreased between the time of admission and hospital discharge (Fig. 4) In contrast, lymphocyte numbers were further decreased, while cytokines and IL-2R/lymphocytes were significantly increased in the deteriorated patients (Fig. 5).\nThe change of various markers in recovered coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) patients.

Results of the test were significant with P &lt; 0 05.\nDiscussion\nThe prevalence of COVID-19 began from December 2019, then quickly spread worldwide, and has now become an urgent public health challenge. In this study, we report a cohort of 389 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Most patients presented with fever, cough and fatigue, which share similar clinical features with previous beta-coronavirus infections, such as SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) [9, 10]. Highly pathogenic human coronaviruses (hCoV) infections frequently lead to lower respiratory tract disease, and disease severity was influenced by initial viral titers in airways, age and co-morbid conditions [6, 11, 12]. We observed that in severe and critical patients the percentage of males was higher than females, and the mean ages of these patients were much older than mild patients. Moreover, critical patients were accompanied by high percentages of manifestations and co-morbidities, indicating the poor prognosis and high CFR of these patients. Therefore, it is of crucial significance to find potential markers to identify critical patients early and give timely effective treatment.\nLymphopenia was observed during SARS and MERS infections [13]. Similarly, the developed lymphopenia was also very common in COVID-19 and this phenomenon was more obvious in ICU patients [6, 7]. The mechanisms of lymphopenia in SARS-CoV-2 infection might be due to inhibition of the cellular immune effective function, and more cells underwent apoptosis following overactive inflammatory responses, as reported in SARS infection [14]. The results of lymphocytes might be associated with disease severity and mortality.\nMassive inflammatory cell infiltration and cytokine storms could result in acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome during SARS and MERS infections, which have been specially emphasized for the pathogenesis of hCoV infections [15]. In COVID-19, both T helper type 1 (Th1) and Th2 cell responses were initiated and the increased amounts of cytokines (e.g. IL-1beta, IFN-gamma, IP-10, MCP1, IL-10 and IL-4) were associated with disease severity [6]. A recent pathological report of COVID-19 has also shown that the counts of CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells were decreased, but with high expression of human leukocyte antigen D-related (HLA-DR) and CD38. The over-activation of T cells, including the increase of proinflammatory Th17 cells and high cytotoxicity of CD8+ T cells, might lead to the severe immune injury [16]. During viral infection, adaptive immune cells not only played a crucial role in virus clearance but also in dampening innate immunity and limiting further damage to the host [17, 18]. However, exuberant inflammatory responses promoted T cell apoptosis, thus resulting in uncontrolled inflammatory responses due to diminished T cell responses. Our data demonstrate that infection biomarkers such as CRP, PCT and ferritin and the concentrations of IL-2R, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and TNF-alpha were all significantly increased with the increased illness severity, suggesting that the magnitude of the cytokine storm results in high morbidity and mortality attributed by immunopathology.\nReliable and feasible early identification of severe patients is crucial in clinical practice, as the mortality of these patients is extremely high [5]. However, the available laboratory markers have limited value at present. During immune activation, CD25 is expressed by T cells and its soluble form (sCD25), also known as IL-2R, is released into the bloodstream [19]. Our data show that increased IL-2R and lymphopenia were both correlated with the severity of COVIN-19. Moreover, the concentration of IL-2R was positively correlated with IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and TNF-alpha, and negatively correlated with lymphocytes. Therefore, the value of IL-2R/lymphocytes was superior to reflect the imbalance of inflammation and immune response.\nIL-2R/lymphocytes, CRP and ferritin were selected as prediction markers of severe illness by multivariable logistic regression analyses. These markers show that infection, injury of immunity and an exaggerated inflammatory response might exert synthetic efforts on the progression of severe illness. The performance of IL-2R/lymphocytes exhibited higher sensitivity and specificity in differentiating critical patients from mild or severe patients. The application of IL-2R/lymphocytes would allow the early diagnosis and treatment of critical patients and decrease mortality. Furthermore, concentrations of cytokines, including IL-2R, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha, were decreased, but lymphocytes were increased in recovered patients. However, lymphocytes were further decreased with high levels of cytokines in disease-deteriorated patients. Therefore, the monitoring these laboratory markers and cytokines could also be used to predict the progression of COVID-19.\nSeveral limitations of this study should be mentioned. First, not all laboratory tests have been included, as these markers are also valuable in COVID-19, such as coagulation and chemistry markers. Secondly, the percentage of severe patients was high in the included population, as Tongji hospital was a designated hospital for admitting severe patients, so the prediction model might have some bias. Thirdly, continuous monitoring data in one patient at different disease courses is limited, and needs to be further validated in larger populations.\nIn summary, this study demonstrates that lymphopenia and high concentrations of cytokines were associated with the pathogenesis of COVID-19, and the findings of the study could help in more clearly understanding the immune disorder of the disease. IL-2R/lymphocytes are a prominent biomarker for early identification of severe patients and predicting the clinical progression of COVID-19.\nDisclosures\nWe declare no competing interests.\nReferences\nA novel coronavirus from patients with pneumonia in China, 2019\nThe novel Chinese coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infections: challenges for fighting the storm\nTransmission of 2019-nCoV infection from an asymptomatic contact in Germany\nEmerging understandings of 2019-nCoV\nCharacteristics of and Important lessons from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in China: summary of a report of 72314 cases from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention\nEpidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study\nClinical Characteristics of 138 hospitalized patients with 2019 novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia in Wuhan, China\nClinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China\nA major outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in Hong Kong\nComparison of demographic, epidemiological, immunological, and clinical characteristics of patients with HIV mono-infection versus patients co-infected with HCV or/and HBV: a Serbian cohort study\nEpidemiological, demographic, and clinical characteristics of 47 cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus disease from Saudi Arabia: a descriptive study\nClinical aspects and outcomes of 70 patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection: a single-center experience in Saudi Arabia\nSARS and MERS: recent insights into emerging coronaviruses\nMechanisms of lymphocyte loss in SARS coronavirus infection\nPathogenic human coronavirus infections: causes and consequences of cytokine storm and immunopathology\nPathological findings of COVID-19 associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome\nT cell responses are required for protection from clinical disease and for virus clearance in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-infected mice\nLymphoma-associated hemophagocytic syndrome: clinical features and treatment outcome\nDevelopment, analytical validation, and initial clinical evaluation of a radioimmunoassay for the measurement of soluble CD25 concentrations in canine serum\n","References depth 1":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A novel coronavirus from patients with pneumonia in China, 2019","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30183-5","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41);

Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here WH-Human 1 coronavirus (and has also been referred to as 2019-nCoV).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China5.\n This outbreak highlights the ongoing ability of viral spill-over from animals to cause severe disease in humans.\n","id":"PMC7094943","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing Group UK","authors":[{"firstname":"Fan","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Su","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yan-Mei","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wen","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhi-Gang","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Wu","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Wu","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jun-Hua","surname":"Tian","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan-Yuan","surname":"Pei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ming-Li","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yu-Ling","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fa-Hui","surname":"Dai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi-Min","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiao-Jiao","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Edward C.","surname":"Holmes","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong-Zhen","surname":"Zhang","email":"zhangyongzhen@shphc.org.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong-Zhen","surname":"Zhang","email":"zhangyongzhen@shphc.org.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.micinf.2020.01.003","date":"2020-01-24","title":"Measures for diagnosing and treating infections by a novel coronavirus responsible for a pneumonia outbreak originating in Wuhan, China","abstract":"On 10 January 2020, a new coronavirus causing a pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan City in central China was denoted as 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization (WHO).\n As of 24 January 2020, there were 887 confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV infection, including 26 deaths, reported in China and other countries.\n Therefore, combating this new virus and stopping the epidemic is a matter of urgency.\n Here, we focus on advances in research and development of fast diagnosis methods, as well as potential prophylactics and therapeutics to prevent or treat 2019-nCoV infection.\n","id":"PMC7102556","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Institut Pasteur.

P?&lt;?.\n01) was negatively correlated with the CT severity scores.\n The receiver?operating characteristic analysis demonstrated that area under the curve of CRP on the first visit for predicting severe COVID?19 was 0.87 (95% CI 0.101.00) at 20.42 mg/L cut?off, with sensitivity and specificity 83% and 91%, respectively.\n CRP in severe COVID?19 patients increased significantly at the initial stage, before CT findings.\n Importantly, CRP, which was associated with disease development, predicted early severe COVID?19.","id":"PMC7262341","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley and Sons Inc.","authors":[{"firstname":"Chaochao","surname":"Tan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fengxia","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kui","surname":"Tan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qionghui","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xixin","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaosong","surname":"Li","email":"lxsong0308@163.com","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.eclinm.2020.100375","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Eosinopenia and elevated C-reactive protein facilitate triage of COVID-19 patients in fever clinic: A retrospective case-control study","abstract":"Background\nCoronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently a pandemic affecting over 200 countries.\n\n Many cities have established designated fever clinics to triage suspected COVID-19 patients from other patients with similar symptoms.\n\n However, given the limited availability of the nucleic acid test as well as long waiting time for both the test and radiographic examination, the quarantine or therapeutic decisions for a large number of mixed patients were often not made in time.\n\n We aimed to identify simple and quickly available laboratory biomarkers to facilitate effective triage at the fever clinics for sorting suspected COVID-19 patients from those with COVID-19-like symptoms.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected clinical, etiological, and laboratory data of 989 patients who visited the Fever Clinic at Wuhan Union Hospital, Wuhan, China, from Jan 31 to Feb 21.

coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 490 years (IQR 410580).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 80 days [IQR 50130]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing Municipal Science and Technology

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 3666 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 36 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 610 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.\n\n Increasing quartile of NLR was statistically significantly associated with secondary outcome.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR is associated with outcomes in unselected critically ill patients.\n\n In patients with sepsis, there was no statistically significant relationship between NLR and mortality.\n\n Further investigation is required to increase understanding of the pathophysiology of this relationship and to validate these findings with data collected prospectively.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article

recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here WH-Human 1 coronavirus (and has also been referred to as 2019-nCoV).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China5.\n This outbreak highlights the ongoing ability of viral spill-over from animals to cause

acute respiratory infection in the Arabian Peninsula, Tunisia, Morocco, France, Italy, Germany, and the UK.\n\n We provide a full description of a fatal case of MERS-CoV infection and associated phylogenetic analyses.\n\n\nMethods\nWe report data for a patient who was admitted to the Klinikum Schwabing (Munich, Germany) for severe acute respiratory infection.\n\n We did diagnostic RT-PCR and indirect immunofluorescence.\n\n From time of diagnosis, respiratory, faecal, and urine samples were obtained for virus quantification.\n\n We constructed a maximum likelihood tree of the five available complete MERS-CoV genomes.\n\n\nFindings\nA 73-year-old man from Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, was transferred to Klinikum Schwabing on March 19, 2013, on day 11 of illness.\n\n He had been diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 2008, and had received several lines of treatment.\n\n The patient died on day 18, due to septic shock.\n\n MERS-CoV was detected in two samples of bronchoalveolar fluid.\n\n Viral loads were highest in samples from the lower respiratory tract (up to 12??106 copies per mL).\n\n Maximum virus concentration in urine samples was 2691 RNA copies per mL on day 13; the virus was not present in the urine after renal failure on day 14. Stool samples obtained on days 12 and 16 contained the virus, with up to 1031 RNA copies per g (close to the lowest detection limit of the assay).\n\n One of two oronasal swabs obtained on day 16 were positive, but yielded little viral RNA (5370 copies per mL).\n\n No virus was detected in blood.\n\n The full virus genome was combined with four other available full genome sequences in a maximum likelihood phylogeny, correlating branch lengths with dates of isolation.\n\n The time of the common ancestor was halfway through 2011. Addition of novel genome data from an unlinked case treated 6 months previously in Essen, Germany, showed a clustering of viruses derived from Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.\n\n\nInterpretation\nWe have provided the first complete viral load profile in a case of MERS-CoV infection.\n\n MERS-CoV might have shedding patterns that are different from those of severe acute respiratory syndrome and so might need alternative diagnostic approaches.\n\n\nFunding\nEuropean Union; German Centre for Infection Research; German Research Council; and German Ministry for

similarities with that of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV.\n\n We aimed to estimate virus transmissibility and the epidemic potential of MERS-CoV, and to compare the results with similar findings obtained for prepandemic SARS.\n\n\nMethods\nWe retrieved data for MERS-CoV clusters from the WHO summary and subsequent reports, and published descriptions of cases, and took into account 55 of the 64 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV reported as of June 21, 2013, excluding cases notified in the previous 2 weeks.\n\n To assess the interhuman transmissibility of MERS-CoV, we used Bayesian analysis to estimate the basic reproduction number (R0) and compared it to that of prepandemic SARS.\n\n We considered two scenarios, depending on the interpretation of the MERS-CoV cluster-size data.\n\n\nResults\nWith our most pessimistic scenario (scenario 2), we estimated MERS-CoV R0 to be 069 (95% CI 050092); by contrast, the R0 for prepandemic SARS-CoV was 080 (054113).\n\n Our optimistic scenario (scenario 1) yielded a MERS-CoV R0 of 060 (042080).\n\n Because of recent implementation of effective contact tracing and isolation procedures, further MERS-CoV transmission data might no longer describe an entire cluster, but only secondary infections directly caused by the index patient.\n\n Hence, we calculated that, under scenario 2, eight or more secondary infections caused by the next index patient would translate into a 5% or higher chance that the revised MERS-CoV R0 would exceed 1ie, that MERS-CoV might have pandemic potential.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur analysis suggests that MERS-CoV does not yet have pandemic potential.\n\n We recommend enhanced surveillance, active contact tracing, and vigorous searches for the MERS-CoV animal hosts and transmission routes to human beings.\n\n\nFunding\nAgence Nationale de la Recherche (Labex Integrative Biology of Emerging Infectious Diseases), and the European Community's Seventh Framework

(SARSCoV).\n\n We did clinical and experimental studies to assess the role of this virus in the cause of SARS.\n\n\nMethods\nWe tested clinical and postmortem samples from 436 SARS patients in six countries for infection with SARSCoV, human metapneumovirus, and other respiratory pathogens.\n\n We infected four cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) with SARS-CoV in an attempt to replicate SARS and did necropsies on day 6 after infection.\n\n\nFindings\nSARS-CoV infection was diagnosed in 329 (75%) of 436 patients fitting the case definition of SARS; human metapneumovirus was diagnosed in 41 (12%) of 335, and other respiratory pathogens were diagnosed only sporadically.\n\n SARS-CoV was, therefore, the most likely causal agent of SARS.\n\n The four SARS-CoV-infected macaques excreted SARS-CoV from nose, mouth, and pharynx from 2 days after infection.\n\n Three of four macaques developed diffuse alveolar damage, similar to that in SARS patients, and characterised by epithelial necrosis, serosanguineous exudate, formation of hyaline membranes, type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia, and the presence of syncytia.\n\n SARS-CoV was detected in pneumonic areas by virus isolation and RT-PCR, and was localised to alveolar epithelial cells and syncytia by immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy.\n\n\nInterpretation\nReplication in SARS-CoV-infected macaques of pneumonia similar to that in human beings with SARS, combined with the high prevalence of SARS-CoV infection in SARS patients, fulfill the criteria required to prove that SARS-CoV is the primary cause of SARS.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7112434","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

defined the clinical presentation and risk factors associated with severe disease and investigated the causal agents by chest radiography and laboratory testing of nasopharyngeal aspirates and sera samples.\n\n We compared the laboratory findings with those submitted for microbiological investigation of other diseases from patients whose identity was masked.\n\n\nFindings\nPatients' age ranged from 23 to 74 years.\n\n Fever, chills, myalgia, and cough were the most frequent complaints.\n\n When compared with chest radiographic changes, respiratory symptoms and auscultatory findings were disproportionally mild.\n\n Patients who were household contacts of other infected people and had older age, lymphopenia, and liver dysfunction were associated with severe disease.\n\n A virus belonging to the family Coronaviridae was isolated from two patients.\n\n By use of serological and reverse-transcriptase PCR specific for this virus, 45 of 50 patients with SARS, but no controls, had evidence of infection with this virus.\n\n\nInterpretation\nA coronavirus was isolated from patients with SARS that might be the primary agent associated with this disease.\n\n Serological and

were studied by histology and virology.\n\n Only one full autopsy was done.\n\n Evidence of infection with the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and human metapneumovirus was sought by reverse-transcriptase PCR and serology.\n\n Pathological samples were examined by light and electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry.\n\n\nFindings\nAll six patients had serological evidence of recent infection with SARS-CoV.\n\n Diffuse alveolar damage was common but not universal.\n\n Morphological changes identified were bronchial epithelial denudation, loss of cilia, and squamous metaplasia.\n\n Secondary bacterial pneumonia was present in one case.\n\n A giant-cell infiltrate was seen in four patients, with a pronounced increase in macrophages in the alveoli and the interstitium of the lung.\n\n Haemophagocytosis was present in two patients.\n\n The alveolar pneumocytes also showed cytomegaly with granular amphophilic cytoplasm.\n\n The patient for whom full autopsy was done had atrophy of the white pulp of the spleen.\n\n Electron microscopy revealed viral particles in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells corresponding to coronavirus.\n\n\nInterpretation\nSARS is associated with epithelial-cell proliferation and an increase in macrophages in the lung.\n\n The presence of haemophagocytosis supports the contention that cytokine dysregulation may account, at least partly, for the severity of the clinical disease.\n\n The case definition of SARS should acknowledge the range of lung pathology associated with this disease.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7112492","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"John

phosphatase 1 (PP1) complex, which protects against SARS-CoV pathogenesis.\n\n We also found that receptors for the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF?) promote pathogenesis, presumably through excessive inflammation.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe current study provides validation of network modeling approaches for identifying important players in virus infection pathogenesis, and a step forward in understanding the host response to an important infectious disease.\n\n The results presented here suggest the role of Kepi in the host response to SARS-CoV, as well as inflammatory activity driving pathogenesis through TNF? signaling in SARS-CoV infections.\n\n Though we have reported the utility of this approach in bacterial and cell culture studies previously, this is the first comprehensive study to confirm that network topology can be used to predict phenotypes in mice with experimental validation.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this

interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin in patients with COVID-19\nHighlights\nThe serum levels of IL-6 and CRP have a significant correlation with the severity of COVID-19.\nThe serum levels of IL-6 and CRP can be used as independent factors to predict disease risk.\nThe validity of PTC needs to be further investigated.\nBackground\nThe inflammatory response plays a critical role in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and inflammatory cytokine storm increases the severity of COVID-19.\nObjective\nTo investigate the ability of interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), and procalcitonin (PCT) to predict mild and severe cases of COVID-19.\nStudy design\nThis retrospective cohort study included 140 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from January 18, 2020, to March 12, 2020. The study population was divided into two groups according to disease severity: a mild group (MG) (n = 107) and a severe group (SG) (n = 33). Data on demographic characteristics, baseline clinical characteristics, and the levels of IL-6, CRP, and PCT on admission were collected.\nResults\nAmong the 140 patients, the levels of IL-6, CRP, and PCT increased in 95 (67.9 %), 91 (65.0 %), and 8 (5.7 %) patients on admission, respectively. The proportion of patients with increased IL-6, CRP, and PCT levels was significantly higher in the SG than in the MG. Cox proportional hazard model showed that IL-6 and CRP could be used as independent factors to predict the severity of COVID-19. Furthermore, patients with IL-6 &gt; 32.1 pg/mL or CRP &gt; 41.8 mg/L were more likely to have severe complications.\nConclusion\nThe serum levels of IL-6 and CRP can effectively assess disease severity and predict outcome in patients with COVID-19.\nBackground\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is highly infectious and contagious. The first COVID-19 epidemic occurred in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The epidemic was declared to be a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization on January 30, 2020. The clinical manifestations change rapidly, and severe cases can lead to hypoxia, multiple organ dysfunction, and death. However, no reliable indicators are yet available to predict disease severity and progression. The objective of this study is to identify specific serological indicators that can be used for diagnosis and guidance of treatment decisions.\nObjective\nTo investigate the ability of IL-6, CRP, and PCT to predict mild and severe cases of COVID-19.\nStudy design\nMethods and definitions\nThe General Hospital of Central Theater Command of People's Liberation Army was designated to treat COVID-19 patients. This single-center, retrospective observational study was approved by the institutional Research Ethics Committee (Process No. 2020-008-1). A total of 141 cases of COVID-19 were confirmed in this hospital between January 18, 2020, and March 12, 2020. All patients were confirmed positively by SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid RT-PCR (Ct value&lt;=38.0, BGI, Shenzhen, China) using specimens derived from oropharyngeal swabs or sputum, prior to or during the hospitalization. All patients were monitored via the electronic health information system, and clinical data were collected until March 12, 2020, the last follow-up date. Patients with severe disease were categorized based on the seventh edition of the Chinese National Health Commission and should meet any of the following criteria: 1) shortness of breath, respiratory rate &gt;=30 beats per min; 2) oxygen saturation &lt;=93 % at rest; 3) arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO2)/oxygen concentration (FiO2) &lt;=300 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 K Pa); and 4) lung images showing obvious progress of lesion size &gt;50 % within 24-48 h. The patients with mild disease should meet the following criteria: 1) mild clinical symptoms or 2) mild or no lesions on imaging findings.\nData collection\nData on demographic characteristics, underlying comorbidities, symptoms, physical and radiological findings, and laboratory tests were collected from electronic and paper medical records. Hospitalization time, hospital discharge time, and time from disease onset to hospitalization were also recorded. Body temperature was measured using an infrared thermometer, and fever was defined as temperature &gt;=37.3  C. Venous blood samples were collected after 12 h fasting in the morning one day after admission and were analyzed within 2 h. All data were checked by two physicians.\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical Package for the Social Sciences software version 25.0 (IBM, Chicago, IL) was used for statistical analysis. Continuous and categorical variables were presented as median (IQR) and n (%), respectively. Mann-Whitney U test, chi2 test, or Fisher's exact test was used to compare continuous and categorical variables.\nThe predictive value of serum IL-6, CRP, and PCT was evaluated by measuring the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). The optimal threshold value was obtained by calculating the Youden index. Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed for analyzing survival data. A multivariate Cox proportional risk model was used to determine predictive factors for disease risk.\nResults\nDemographic data and initial clinical signs and symptoms\nDemographic data and initial clinical signs and symptoms in the study cohort.\nTable 1	 	\n	Total n = 140	Mild group n = 107	Severe group n = 33	X2/Z	p-value	 	Age	65.5 (54.3-73.0)	62.0 (52.0-69.0)	77.0 (65.5-87.5)			 	Sex	Female	91 (65.0 %)	66 (61.7 %)	25 (75.8 %)	2.196	0.138	 	Male	49 (35.0 %)	41 (38.3 %)	8 (24.2 %)	 	Time from onset to hospitalization (days)	8.0 (4.0-13.8)	8.0 (4.0-14.0)	8.0 (3.5-10.5)	-0.497	0.619	 	Hospitalization time	19.0 (13.0-29.0)	18.0 (13.0-28.0)	21.0 (12.0-30.5)	-0.469	0.639	 	Comorbidities	Cardiopathy	35 (25.0 %)	22 (20.6 %)	13 (39.4 %)	4.771	0.029	 	Respiratory disease	16 (11.4 %)	12 (11.2 %)	4 (12.1 %)	0.000	1.000	 	Hypertension	63 (45 %)	41 (38.3 %)	22 (66.7 %)	8.190	0.004	 	Diabetes	34 (24.3 %)	22 (20.6 %)	12 (36.4 %)	3.425	0.064	 	Treatments	Antiviral drugs	131 (93.6 %)	99 (92.5 %)	32 (97.0 %)	0.255	0.614	 	Antibiotics	128 (91.4 %)	95 (88.8 %)	33 (100 %)	2.743	0.098	 	Clinical symptoms	Fever	90 (64.3 %)	69 (64.5 %)	21 (63.6 %)	0.008	0.929	 	Cough	63 (45.0 %)	46 (43.0 %)	17 (51.5 %)	0.741	0.389	 	Diarrhea	5 (3.6 %)	4 (3.7 %)	1 (3.0 %)	0.000	1.000	 	Fatigue	21 (15.0 %)	11 (10.3 %)	10 (30.3 %)	6.438	0.011	 	Loss of appetite	9 (6.4 %)	5 (4.7 %)	4 (12.1 %)	1.253	0.263	 	Myalgia	13 (9.3 %)	9 (8.4 %)	4 (12.1 %)	0.089	0.765	 	Dyspnea	9 (6.4 %)	3 (2.8 %)	6 (18.2 %)	7.524	0.006	 	Chest tightness	14 (10.0 %)	6 (5.6 %)	8 (24.2 %)	7.771	0.005	 	Nausea	3 (2.1 %)	0	3 (9.1 %)		0.012	 	Dizziness	4 (2.9 %)	3 (2.8 %)	1 (3.0 %)		1.000	 	Headache	2 (1.4 %)	2 (1.9 %)	0		1.000	 	Abdominal pain	3 (2.1 %)	2 (1.9 %)	1 (3.0 %)		0.557	 	\nData are median (IQR), n (%), or n/N (%).

In the study population, 107 patients were assigned to a mild group (MG) and 33 patients were allocated to a severe group (SG). There was no significant difference in the male to female ratio between the two groups. The median age was 65.5 years (range, 23-96). The average age was significantly higher in the SG than in the MG (P &lt; 0.0001, Table 1 ). Overall, the most common initial symptoms were fever (64.3 %) and cough (45.0 %), followed by fatigue, muscle soreness, and chest tightness (Table 1). Most patients had comorbidities, including hypertension (45 %), heart disease(25 %), diabetes(24.3 %), and respiratory diseases(11.4 %). The number of comorbidities was significantly higher in patients in the SG (Table 1).

The AUROC of these parameters ranged between 0.8 and 0.9 (IL-6, 0.808; CRP, 0.858; and PCT, 0.812), indicating a high diagnostic value for clinical severity (Fig. 2 ). Furthermore, the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of these inflammatory markers were calculated to obtain the optimal threshold value, which corresponded to 32.1 pg/mL, 41.8 mg/L, and 0.07 ng/mL for IL-6, CRP, and PCT, respectively (Table 3 ).\nSerum levels of IL-6, CRP, and PCT can distinguish between severe and mild cases\nSurvival according to the levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6),C-reactive protein (CRP), and procalcitonin (PCT).\nFig. 3\nWe hypothesized that patients with higher levels of IL-6, CRP, or PCT were more likely to have severe disease.

The patients with IL-6 &gt; 32.1 pg/mL, CRP &gt; 41.8 mg/L, or PCT &gt; 0.07 ng/mL were more likely to have severe complications (HR, 2.375; 95 % CI, 1.058-5.329; P &lt; 0.001 for IL-6; HR, 4.394; 95 % CI, 1.924-10.033; P &lt; 0.001 for CRP; HR, 4.908; 95 % CI, 1.797-13.402; P = 0.002 for PCT) (Table 4 ).\nDiscussion\nThe inflammatory response plays a critical role in COVID-19, and inflammatory cytokine storm increases the severity of COVID-19. Wan et al. found that cytokine storm is crucial to the progression of COVID-19 and can lead to severe complications and death. The fifth edition of &quot;Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19&quot; recommends monitoring the cytokine levels to improve treatment efficacy and reduce mortality. The seventh edition of this guideline points out that peripheral blood inflammatory factors such as IL-6 may increase during COVID-19 infection.\nThe levels of IL-6, CRP, and PCT increased significantly in 67.9 %, 65.0 %, and 5.7 % of patients on admission, respectively. The proportion of patients with increased levels of IL-6, CRP, and PCT was significantly higher in the SG than in the MG, which is consistent with the concept of &quot;cytokine storm&quot; proposed by Professor Li Lanjuan, who demonstrated that inflammatory factors played a crucial role in the progression from mild to severe disease.\nCox proportional hazard model analysis showed that IL-6, CRP, and PCT could be used as independent factors to predict the severity of COVID-19. IL-6 is a multifunctional cytokine that transmits cell signaling and regulates immune cells. This factor has a strong proinflammatory effect with multiple biological functions and plays an important role in inflammation, tumor, and hematological diseases. IL-6 is the primary trigger for cytokine storms. Yang et al. pointed out that peripheral blood IL-6 levels could be used as an independent factor to predict the progression of COVID-19, which is consistent with the results of this study; therefore, the role of IL-6 in this disease deserves special attention.\nCRP is a non-specific acute-phase protein induced by IL-6 in the liver and a sensitive biomarker of inflammation, infection, and tissue damage. CRP expression level is usually low but increases rapidly and significantly during acute inflammatory responses. The elevation of CRP in isolation or in combination with other markers may reveal bacterial or viral infections. Our study explored the relationship between CRP and COVID-19 and found that patients with CRP &gt; 41.8 mg/L were more likely to develop severe disease.\nPCT is a glycoprotein without hormonal activity and the precursor of calcitonin. Serum PCT levels are usually low or undetectable. PCT levels are increased by bacterial infections and relatively low with viral infections and, therefore, can be used to distinguish between bacterial and viral infections. The higher PCT levels in the SG suggest that severe COVID-19 patients may have concomitant bacterial infections. It should be noted that the optimal cut-off value of PCT was 0.07 ng/mL and did not exceed the normal range (0-0.5 ng/mL), and this result may be due to the small sample size (eight patients). Therefore, the validity of PCT as an independent factor to predict the severity of COVID-19 needs to be further studied using a larger sample size.\nThis study has limitations. First, the number of cases was small because of the single-center design of the study. Second, clinical data were limited.\nIn conclusion, the serum levels of IL-6 and CRP have a significant correlation with the severity of COVID-19 and can be used as independent factors to predict disease risk. However, the validity of PCT needs to be further investigated.\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n Fang Liu: Data curation, Writing - original draft.

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 3666 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 36 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 610 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome

patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship

of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 490 years (IQR 410580).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 80 days [IQR 50130]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing

IL-6-mediated signaling, JAK2, STAT3 and p38 inhibitors reduced angiotensinogen expression in the partially hepatectomized mice.\n\n\nConclusion\nDuring liver regeneration, IL-6-enhanced angiotensinogen expression is dependent on the JAK/STAT3 and JAK/p38/NF-kB signaling pathways.\n\n Interruption of the molecular mechanisms of angiotensinogen regulation may be applied as the basis of therapeutic strategies for preventing angiotensin II-related ischemia-reperfusion injury during liver regeneration.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3700864","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public

On the resolutive phase of the disease, CT abnormalities showed complete resolution, or demonstrated residual linear opacities.\nConclusions\nDifferent CT features are seen according to disease severity, which can help COVID-19 stratification.\nIntroduction\nCoronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) is an acute infectious disease mainly involving the respiratory system, which was recently found in humans. The first patient was found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China on December 12, 2019. The symptoms of patients were fever, fatigue, dry-cough and the patients gradually developed severe dyspnea. The majority of them had a good prognosis, while a mortality rate of 2.1 % has been recently reported. The average incubation period of the disease was found to be 6.4 days. At present, the diagnosis relies on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or gene sequencing of sputum, throat swab or lower respiratory tract secretion. However, these methods are time-consuming and do not allow assessing the disease severity. Chest CT scanning can provide rapid screening and assess the severity. In this study, we report the CT characteristics of patients with COVID-19 of various severity to provide a more comprehensive overview of the disease, in order to help the clinical diagnosis and management.\nMaterials and methods\nStudy population\nThis retrospective study was approved by our Institutional Ethics Committee. The data of patients were collected from 6 hospitals in Anhui province, China from Jan 21 to Feb 3, 2020. The electronic medical records were reviewed and analyzed. Seventy-three patients with proven COVID-19 were enrolled in this study, including 41 males and 32 females; aged 5-86 years, with mean age of (41.6 +- 14.5) years. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was made in accordance with the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia (fifth edition) formulated by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China. The CT images and clinical data of all patients were collected. Among the 73 patients, 54 (74 %) had the travel history to or from Wuhan, 16 (22 %) had a history of close contact with the local COVID-19 patients before the illness onset, and the remaining 3 patients denied any contact or travel history. All patients were administered with anti-viral and supportive treatment, and prevention of complications based on their clinical condition.\nCT scanning\nA high-resolution CT scan was performed in all patients with 64-slice multi-detector row CT scanners (Toshiba Aquilion-64, Philips Brilliance-64, GE LightSpeed-64, Siemens Sensation-64, and Neusoft Viz-64). Patients were scanned in the supine position, during breath hold, from the lung apices down to the costophrenic angles. The acquisition parameters were as follows: tube voltage 100-120 kV, tube current 110-280 mA, or intelligent milliampere second (50-300 mA s), pitch 1.375, FOV 350-400 mm. The 1.25 mm or 2.5 mm thick images were reconstructed using a high-frequency reconstruction algorithm, and lung windowing and stored in the PACS system.\nCT images analysis\nAll images were independently read by 3 senior radiological specialists. The location, shape, number and size of the abnormalities on chest CT were carefully observed and recorded. In case of discordant reading, consensus was reached during another reading session.\nClinical typing\nThe severity of the disease was classified into 4 categories according to the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia (fifth edition): (1) mild type: patients with mild clinical symptoms and no pulmonary changes on CT imaging; (2) common type: patients with symptoms of fever and signs of respiratory infection, and having pneumonia changes on CT imaging; (3) severe type: patients presenting with any one item of the following: a. respiratory distress, respiratory rate &gt;= 30/min; b. oxygen saturation of finger &lt;= 93 % in resting condition; c. arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) /oxygen concentration (FiO2) &lt;= 300 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa); (4) critical type: patients meeting any one of the following criteria: a. respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation; b. shock; c. requiring ICU admission requirement due to multiple organ failure.\nStatistical analysis\nSPSS statistical software (version 22.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, United States) was used for analysis. The prevalence of imaging findings was estimated as the percentage of patients showing each abnormality. The measured data were expressed as mean +- standard deviation (+- s), and one-way analysis of variance was used. P value &lt; 0.05 was considered for statistical significance.\nResults\nClinical features\nDemographics and baseline characteristics of patients infected with coronavirus disease-2019 [n (%)].\nTable 1	 	\n	mild type(n = 6)	common type(n = 43)	severe type(n = 21)	critical type(n = 3)	 	Gender					 	Men	3 (50 %)	28 (65 %)	10 (48 %)	0	 	Women	3 (50 %)	15 (35 %)	11 (52 %)	3 (100 %)	 	Age (years)	29.2 +- 10.9	33.4 +- 12.2	44.2 +- 12.0	63.0 +- 21.2	 	Exposure History					 	Recent travel to or from Wuhan	4 (67 %)	29 (67 %)	18 (85 %)	3 (100 %)	 	Exposure to Infected Patients	2 (33 %)	12 (28 %)	2 (10 %)	0	 	Unknown Exposure	0	2 (5%)	1 (5%)	0	 	Symptoms					 	Fever	5 (83 %)	40 (93 %)	20 (95 %)	3 (100 %)	 	Cough	4 (67 %)	36 (84 %)	18 (86 %)	2 (67 %)	 	Fatigue	4 (67 %)	31 (72 %)	17 (81 %)	3 (100 %)	 	Sputum Production	1 (17 %)	22 (51 %)	14 (67 %)	2 (67 %)	 	Poor Appetite	0	8 (19 %)	9 (43 %)	3 (100 %)	 	Days from Symptoms Onset to CT Scan					 	Within 1 day	2 (33 %)	3 (7%)	0	0	 	1 to 3 days	3 (50 %)	13 (30 %)	4 (19 %)	0	 	&gt;3 days	1 (17 %)	27 (63 %)	17 (81 %)	3 (100 %)	 	Days from PCR Testing to CT Scan					 	Within 1 Day before PCR	3 (50 %)	28 (65 %)	15 (71 %)	3 (100 %)	 	&lt;=2 days after PCR	2 (33 %)	9 (21 %)	4 (19 %)	0	 	&gt;2 days after PCR	1 (17 %)	6 (14 %)	2 (10 %)	0	 	Days of Follow-up Scans	5.8 +- 1.2	4.9 +- 1.4	4.5 +- 1.0	3.7 +- 1.1	 	\nNote- PCR: polymerase chain reaction.\nThe delay from contact with infected individual(s) to onset of disease was within 3 days in 28 patients (38 %), 3-7 days in 42 cases (58 %) and more than 7 days in 3 cases (4%). According to severity classification, patients with mild, common, severe and critical type represented 6 (8%), 43 (59 %), 21 (29 %) and 3 (4%) cases, respectively. The main clinical manifestations were fever in 68 cases (93 %), cough in 60 cases (82 %), fatigue in 55 cases (75 %), sputum production in 39 cases (53 %), anorexia in 20 cases (27 %), whereas 3 patients (4%) were symptom-free. The baseline characteristics of patients were listed in Table 1 .\nCT manifestations\nCT manifestations by severity of disease\nCT features of coronavirus disease-2019 by disease severity. A.

(2) All 43 common type patients showed unique or multiple ground-glass opacities (GGO) in the periphery of both lungs (Fig. 1B). Twelve cases showed GGO as the unique manifestation (28 %, 12/43), 15 cases (35 %, 15/43) accompanied with paving stone sign, with(27 %, 4/15)or without (73 %, 11/15) inter and intralobular septal thickening; some of them (7%, 3/43) presenting air-bronchogram. The opacities had a fan-shaped distribution in 3 cases (7%, 3/43), mainly seen at the dorsal field of the lungs. (3) In the 21 patients with severe type, extensive GGO and pulmonary consolidation were found in 16 (76 %, 16/21) and 5 cases (24 %), respectively (Fig. 1C). The GGO were irregular, fan-shaped distribution, with ill-defined borders. Some patients presented peribronchial thickening (14/21, 67 %). Air bronchogram was a rare finding. (4) CT manifestations of critical type included confluent lesions and involved multiple lobes, pulmonary fibrosis and &quot;white lung&quot; formation (Fig. 1D). Atelectasis and pleural effusion were found in 1 and 3 patients, respectively. The location and morphology of pulmonary lesions in different types were summarized in Table 2 .\nCT manifestations of disease improvement\nCT features of the disease amelioration in patient with coronavirus disease-2019. A 27-year-old female patient has fever for 10 days and pharyngalgia for 3 days, with the medical history of contacting with the infected patient. The detection of new coronavirus nucleic acid was positive. A. On admission day, CT scan shows multiple ground-glass opacities and pulmonary consolidation in both lungs. B. Three days after admission, CT scan shows that the density of the foci is lighter and the size is smaller than that at admission day. C. Seven days after treatment, re-examination of CT shows that the lesions in both lungs are further absorbed.\nFig. 2\nDuring follow-up, twelve patients (16 %) dramatically improved. A new CT showed that lesions had decreased in size by more than half in 8 cases (67 %, 8/12) after the patients had received antiviral and supportive treatment after one week of hospital admission. Among them, 3 patients showed remarkable absorption (Fig. 2 ). Four other patients showed residual interstitial abnormalities with persisting septal lines.\nDiscussion\nCurrently, RT-PCR of sputum, throat swab and lower respiratory tract secretion or sequencing of virus gene represents the gold standard technique for the diagnosis of COVID-19. However, the testing requires at least several hours, and has a false negative rate of more than 5%; the latter is even more time-consuming. CT imaging can demonstrate typical features making the diagnosis of COVID-19 quite likely, which can help to rapidly screen patients, and to stratify the patients' severity to quickly develop effective treatment strategies.\nIn the present study, the patients with mild type pneumonia had no obvious changes on CT images. Ground-glass opacities were the most common manifestation, in either the common or severe type patients. Most of the lesions were distributed along the bronchovascular bundle or the dorsolateral and subpleural part of the lungs and were seen with or without interlobular septal thickening. These changes might reflect fluid exudation in the alveolar lumen, secondary to dilation and congestion of alveolar septal capillary, and interstitial edema in the interlobular septa.\nPulmonary consolidation is mainly found in severe and critical types patients, which can coexist with ground glass and fibrotic changes. The pathological bases of these changes are not clear currently. We speculate that the changes of pulmonary interstitium may be due to inflammatory cell infiltration, edema, and interstitial thickening, whereas pulmonary parenchyma changes could reflect alveolar hemorrhage, edema, cell exudation and hyaline membrane formation. Of course, these hypotheses have not been confirmed by pathological examination.\nAtelectasis and pleural effusion are rare findings on CT, and were only seen in 1 and 3 cases, respectively in the present study. All of them are found in critical stages patients, suggesting that patients may have a poorer prognosis when these signs occur.\nUntil the end of observation, 12 patients had recovered from this disease, the ground-glass opacities and consolidation resolved in most of them. The interlobular septum and bronchial wall thickening, band opacities and scattered patchy consolidation may remain in a minority of patients. These changes resemble the features of common viral pneumonia.\nThe CT features of COVID-19 need to be differentiated from those due to adenovirus pneumonia, influenza A (H1N1), and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Adenovirus pneumonia mostly occurs in children and mainly involves the middle and inner part of both lungs. The lung hila are widened. Pleural effusion, pneumothorax, mediastinal emphysema and subcutaneous emphysema occur frequently. The CT manifestations of H1N1 pneumonia also combine ground glass opacities and consolidations, with a peribronchovascular predominance. The lung manifestations of SARS are characterized by large pulmonary consolidation, often with obvious air bronchogram.\nBernheim et al. review the CT findings of 121 symptomatic patients infected with COVID-19 in relationship to the time between symptom onset and the initial CT scan and find that the early patients (0-2 days) have far fewer frequency of GGO and consolidation and lower severity score of pneumonia as compared with the intermediate (3-5 days) and late (6-12 days) patients. The authors' study is of significance for recognizing imaging patterns based on infection time course. However, in many patients, the disease severity is often not consistent with the course of disease. Our study analyses the chest CT characteristics of COVID-19 based on the staging of disease severity, which likely more accurately reflects the relationship between CT features and disease severity compared with the previous study.\nThis study has some limitations. Firstly, this is a retrospective study, the time of CT examination of patients was uneven, which bias CT features description. Secondly, no pathological study was performed in the present study, which makes it impossible to evaluate the relationship between CT features and pathological changes. Finally, it is not possible to exclude the possibility of superinfection in some of the patients.\nIn conclusion, CT imaging can play an important role in the early diagnosis and disease stratification of COVID-19.Patchy ground-glass opacities and large consolidation located in the peripheral part of both lungs are the typical CT manifestations. The size and type of CT abnormalities are related to disease severity.\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n Kai-Cai Liu: Data curation, Writing - original draft.

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 3666 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 36 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 610 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile

2020.\nFindings\nOf the 99 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, 49 (49%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market.\n\n The average age of the patients was 555 years (SD 131), including 67 men and 32 women.\n\n 2019-nCoV was detected in all patients by real-time RT-PCR.\n\n 50 (51%) patients had chronic diseases.\n\n Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (82 [83%] patients), cough (81 [82%] patients), shortness of breath (31 [31%] patients), muscle ache (11 [11%] patients), confusion (nine [9%] patients), headache (eight [8%] patients), sore throat (five [5%] patients), rhinorrhoea (four [4%] patients), chest pain (two [2%] patients), diarrhoea (two [2%] patients), and nausea and vomiting (one [1%] patient).\n\n According to imaging examination, 74 (75%) patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 14 (14%) patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity, and one (1%) patient had pneumothorax.\n\n 17 (17%) patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and, among them, 11 (11%) patients worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection was of clustering onset, is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n In general, characteristics of patients who died were in line with the MuLBSTA score, an early warning model for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia.\n\n Further investigation is needed to explore the applicability of the MuLBSTA score in predicting the risk of mortality in 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key R&amp;D Program of China.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7135076","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 490 years (IQR 410580).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 80 days [IQR 50130]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing Municipal Science and Technology

epidemiological studies of SARS comparing epidemiologic features across regions.\n\n The aim of this study is to identify similarities and differences in SARS epidemiology in three populations with similar host and viral genotype.\n\n\nMethods\nWe present a comparative epidemiologic analysis of SARS, based on an integrated dataset with 3,336 SARS patients from Hong Kong, Beijing and Taiwan, epidemiological and clinical characteristics such as incubation, onset-to-admission, onset-to-discharge and onset-to-death periods, case fatality ratios (CFRs) and presenting symptoms are described and compared between regions.\n\n We further explored the influence of demographic and clinical variables on the apparently large differences in CFRs between the three regions.\n\n\nResults\nAll three regions showed similar incubation periods and progressive shortening of the onset-to-admission interval through the epidemic.\n\n Adjusted for sex, health care worker status and nosocomial setting, older age was associated with a higher fatality, with adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 2.10 (95% confidence interval: 1.45, 3.04) for those aged 51-60; AOR: 4.57 (95% confidence interval: 3.32, 7.30) for

2.21).\n\n\nConclusion\nThe large discrepancy in crude fatality ratios across the three regions can only be partly explained by epidemiological and clinical heterogeneities.\n\n Our findings underline the importance of a common data collection platform, especially in an emerging epidemic, in order to identify and explain consistencies and differences in the eventual clinical and public health outcomes of infectious disease outbreaks, which is becoming increasingly important in our highly interconnected world.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2846944","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 9998% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and Prevention of Infectious Disease in China, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shandong First Medical University.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7159086","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 3666 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 36 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 610 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 490 years (IQR 410580).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 80 days [IQR 50130]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and

in Immunocompetent Adults: A Multicenter Case Series","abstract":"Background\nSevere community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) caused by human adenovirus (HAdV), especially HAdV type 55 (HAdV-55) in immunocompetent adults has raised increasing concerns.\n\n Clinical knowledge of severe CAP and acute respiratory distress syndrome induced by HAdV-55 is still limited, though the pathogen has been fully characterized by whole-genome sequencing.\n\n\nMethods\nWe conducted a multicentre retrospective review of all consecutive patients with severe CAP caused by HAdV in immunocompetent adults admitted to the Emergency Department Intensive Care Unit of two hospitals in Northern China between February 2012 and April 2014. Clinical, laboratory, radiological characteristics, treatments and outcomes of these patients were collected and analyzed.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 15 consecutive severe CAP patients with laboratory-confirmed adenovirus infections were included.\n\n The median age was 30 years and all cases were identified during the winter and spring seasons.\n\n HAdV-55 was the most frequently (11/15) detected HAdV type.\n\n Persistent high fever, cough and rapid progression of dyspnea were typically reported in these patients.\n\n Significantly increased pneumonia severity index (PSI), respiratory rate, and lower PaO2/FiO2, hypersensitive CRP were reported in non-survivors compared to survivors (P = 0.013, 0.022, 0.019 and 0.026, respectively).\n\n The rapid development of bilateral consolidations within 10 days after illness onset were the most common radiographic finding, usually accompanied by adjacent ground glass opacities and pleural effusions.\n\n Total mortality was 26.7% in this study.\n\n Corticosteroids were prescribed to 14 patients in this report, but the utilization rate between survivors and non-survivors was not significant.\n\n\nConclusions\nHAdV and the HAdV-55 sub-type play an important role among viral pneumonia pathogens in hospitalized immunocompetent adults in Northern China.\n\n HAdV should be tested in severe CAP patients with negative bacterial cultures and a lack of response to antibiotic treatment, even if radiologic imaging and clinical presentation initially suggest bacterial pneumonia.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4788423","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

rash.\n\n Her blood tests were non-specifically abnormal, and tests for bacterial pathogens were negative.\n\n Her condition rapidly deteriorated while she was in our hospital and required mechanical ventilation and inotropic support.\n\n A multiplex real-time RT-PCR assay performed on respiratory specimens to detect respiratory viruses was negative for influenza but positive for adenovirus

Quantitative reverse-transcriptase (RT) PCR of nasopharyngeal aspirates in 14 patients (four with ARDS) showed peak viral load at day 10, and at day 15 a load lower than at admission.\n\n Age and chronic hepatitis B virus infection treated with lamivudine were independent significant risk factors for progression to ARDS (p=0.001).\n\n SARS-associated coronavirus in faeces was seen on RT-PCR in 65 (97%) of 67 patients at day 14.
