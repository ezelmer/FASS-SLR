Older adults and patients with comorbidities and immunosuppressive conditions may experience severe signs and symptoms that can lead to death. This case series assesses the clinical course, imaging features, and outcomes for 12 patients with COVID-19 and a history of kidney transplantation. Patients were evaluated for symptoms, laboratory data, imaging findings, and outcomes from February 2020 to April 2020. Fever, cough, and dyspnea were the most common clinical symptoms, noted in 75% (nine/12), 75% (nine/12), and 41.7% (five/12) of the patients, respectively. Most of the patients had a normal white blood cell count, while 33.3% (four/12) had leukopenia and 8.3% (one/12) had leukocytosis. A combination of consolidation and ground glass opacity was the most predominant (75%) pattern of lung involvement on computed tomography (CT). Eight patients died of severe COVID-19 pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome and four were discharged. All recovered cases had a unilateral peripheral pattern of involvement limited to only one zone on initial chest CT. It seems that CT imaging has an important role in predicting COVID-19 outcomes for solid organ transplant recipients. Future studies with long-term follow up and more cases are needed to elucidate COVID-19 diagnosis, outcome, and management strategies for these patients.\nCase series\nBackground\nOn December 31, 2019, a novel corona virus was extracted from the respiratory secretions of several patients presenting with lower respiratory tract infection of unknown origin in Wuhan, China. While the mortality rate of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is believed to be approximately 5%, older adults and those with an underlying chronic disease are specifically at high risk of presenting with severe symptoms, having poorer prognosis, and even developing fatal conditions. Use of immunosuppressive medications such as steroids may also be linked to severe manifestation of the disease, as in patients with previous respiratory viral infections such as H1N1.\nSolid organ transplant recipients are on long-term immunosuppressive regimens and are at particular risk of contracting severe respiratory tract infection and possibly with atypical presentation. There are currently limited data on the clinical course, imaging features, and outcomes for COVID-19 in renal transplant recipients. Although some studies noted no other outstanding severe disease among immunosuppressed patients with COVID-19, other studies revealed that immunocompromised patients may have an impaired immune response and high levels of viral load.\nHere we report clinical and imaging findings for COVID-19 and outcomes in a group of patients with a functioning renal transplant under an immunosuppressive regimen.\nCases\nThe study cases consisted of 12 patients with a functioning renal transplant who were admitted to our tertiary hospital with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 between February 25, 2020 and April 12, 2020.\nAll subjects met the following inclusion criteria: (1) symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 pneumonia (ie, fever, cough, dyspnea, sore throat, myalgia, headache, nausea, or abdominal pain); (2) positive SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal sample (polymerase chain reaction-based test); (3) chest computed tomography (CT) scan suggestive of COVID-19; and (4) lymphocytopenia (absolute lymphocyte count &lt;1000) or dyspnea or O2 saturation &lt;93% or respiratory rate &gt;30/min.\nDemographic and clinical features and outcomes for the 12 patients.\nTable 1	 	\nPt	Gender	Age (yr)	Age of KTx (yr)	CMBs	Fever	Cough	HA	Myalgia	Dyspnea	GIS	SO2 (%)	Outcome	 	1	Female	29	8	None	+	+	-	-	-	-	88	Discharged	 	2	Male	32	12	HTN	+	+	-	+	+	+	85	Discharged	 	3	Male	58	14	None	-	-	-	-	-	-	88	Death	 	4	Male	38	15	None	-	+	-	+	+	-	84	Death	 	5	Male	54	18	Asthma + SA	+	+	-	-	-	-	90	Death	 	6	Male	46	3	None	+	+	-	-	+	-	85	Discharged	 	7	Male	66	4	None	+	-	-	-	-	-	85	Death	 	8	Male	32	17	None	+	+	-	-	+	-	84	Death	 	9	Male	64	6	None	+	+	-	-	+	-	90	Death	 	10	Male	64	3	None	+	+	-	-	-	-	84	Death	 	11	Female	49	17	HTN	-	+	+	-	-	-	90	Discharged	 	12	Female	40	16	None	+	-	-	-	-	-	88	Death	 	\nKTx = kidney transplantation; CMBs = comorbidities; HTN = hypertension; SA = stable angina; HA = headache; GIS = gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain/diarrhea); SO2 = oxygen saturation on room air.\nBaseline laboratory findings.\nTable 2	 	\n	Patient	Summary	 		1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9	10	11	12	(mean +- SD)	 	White blood cell count	2000	5500	3800	5600	12 200	8700	7200	8800	4200	3100	7500	2500	5925 +- 3050	 	Neutrophil count	1040	4345	2470	4984	11 590	6264	5976	7920	3318	2697	6000	2050	4887.83 +- 2934.14	 	Lymphocyte count	840	1100	1140	560	610	2001	1152	704	798	279	1200	375	896.58 +- 464.81	 	Eosinophils (%)	3	0	2	0	0	2	0	0	1	2	2	1	-	 	Hemoglobin (g/dl)	9.1	11.7	15.4	11	9.9	12.4	9.1	11.7	13.6	11.1	15.2	8.5	11.55 +- 2.28	 	Platelets (x103)	131	485	123	148	263	465	160	171	107	54	161	98	197 +- 139	 	C-reactive protein (mg/l)	17	30	5	61	40	66	24	49	3	31	23	30	31.58 +- 19.76	 	Lactate dehydrogenase (U/l)	305	384	412	110	506	80	326	641	592	931	898	928	509.41 +- 297.36	 	Creatinine (mg/dl)	2.99	0.92	1.53	2.55	2.96	1.77	2.50	4.60	1.23	1.50	1.51	3.60	2.3 +- 1.09	 	Blood urea nitrogen (mg/dl)	85	23	33	119	156	60	145	150	30	39	18	137	82.91 +- 55.16	 	Aspartate transaminase (U/l)	19	17	25	24	19	26	12	28	37	167	31	12	34.75 +- 42.3	 	Alanine transaminase (U/l)	6	11	17	8	19	42	14	14	19	96	43	8	24.75 +- 25.52	 	Alkaline phosphatase (U/l)	92	118	203	205	128	106	90	102	148	204	237	134	147.25 +- 51.52	 	Albumin (g/l)	3.1	4	3	4.5	3.1	3	3.6	3.2	3.4	2.7	3.3	3.9	3.4 +- 0.51	 	Na (mEq/l)	138	139	138	137	141	143	141	133	137	133	142	140	138.5 +- 3.2	 	K (mEq/l)	4.5	3.5	4.1	3.6	3.4	5	5	4.1	4	4.4	3.7	3.4	4.05 +- 0.57	 	Prothrombin time (s)	10.5	10.6	9.8	11.6	13.3	10	11.7	11.1	9.8	14.8	9.8	9.9	11.07 +- 1.58	 	Partial thromboplastin time (s)	20	20	20	22	27	20	23	69	20	37	26	20	27.05 +- 14.18	 	International normalized ratio	1.01	1.06	0.9	1.13	1.3	1.1	1.14	1.07	0.94	1.4	0.9	0.95	1.07 +- 0.15	 	\nSD = standard deviation.\nNine patients were male (75%) and three were female (25%). The mean age (+- standard deviation) of the patients was 47.66 +- 1.35 (range 29-66) yr. The most common symptoms were fever, cough, and dyspnea, noted in 75% (nine/12), 75% (nine/12), and 41.7% (five/12), respectively. On admission, all patients were on standard triple immunosuppressive therapy (steroid, calcineurin inhibitor/sirolimus, mycophenolate mofetil/azathioprine). The medical history of the patients was reviewed for any chronic conditions other than chronic renal failure. Table 1 shows detailed clinical characteristics of the cases. Leukopenia was observed in 33.3% (four/12) and leukocytosis in 8.3% (one/12). C-reactive protein was elevated in 83.3% (10/12) and creatine phosphokinase in 55% (five/nine). On admission, mean blood urea nitrogen was 82.9 +- 55.2 mg/dl and creatinine was 2.30 +- 1.09 mg/dl. Graft function on admission in terms of estimated glomerular filtration rate based on the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation was 39.9 +- 24.5 cm3/min. Table 2 lists detailed laboratory findings.\nOn admission, the oral steroid was changed to intravenous steroid administration. The immunosuppressive dose was reduced according to the protocol in our center under consultation with multidisciplinary team comprising a nephrologist, urologist, and infectious disease specialist. Hydroxychloroquine 400 mg stat, Kaletra (lopinavir/ritonavir) 400/100 mg twice daily, and suitable intravenous antibiotics were initiated for all patients. Intravenous immunoglobulin 1-2 g/kg in segregated doses over 5 d was administered in the case of hypoxemia and a creatinine rise with clinical suspicion of kidney transplant rejection.\nAs a part of our national COVID-19 guidelines, all patients underwent noncontrast chest CT imaging using a low-dose protocol. Two expert radiologists with 9 and 18 yr of experience interpreted the images independently. In the case of disagreement between the readings, the two radiologists reassessed the images in order to reach consensus. The laterality of the disease (unilateral vs bilateral), the distribution (peripheral vs central, anterior vs posterior), and the predominant zonal involvement (upper, middle, lower, or diffuse) were recorded. The predominant pattern of involvement in each lobe was assessed and categorized as ground-glass opacity (GGO) or consolidation. When there was a combination of GGO and consolidation, the allocation was divided between them accordingly. The percentage of lobar involvement was scored using the following system: 0, no involvement; 1, &lt;25%; 2, 26-50%; 3, 51-75%; and 4, &gt;75% involvement. The scores for each lobe were summed to calculate the total lung score (maximum score 20). The final score was multiplied by five to estimate the percentage lung involvement. The presence of other imaging features was also assessed on CT scan images, including interlobular septal thickening, crazy-paving pattern, reverse halo sign, cystic changes, presence of cavitations, lymphadenopathy (defined as lymph node with short axis &gt;10 mm), and pleural and pericardial effusion.\nFrequency of chest computed tomography scan features in the 12 patients.\nTable 3	 	\nParameter	Patients, n (%)	 	Lung involvement	Bilateral	8 (66.7)	 		Unilateral	4 (33.3)	 	Lobar anatomy	Right upper lobe	9 (75)	 		Right middle lobe	10 (83.3)	 		Right lower lobe	11 (91.7)	 		Left upper lobe	9 (75)	 		Left lower lobe	11 (91.7)	 	Zonal anatomy	Upper	1 (8.3)	 		Middle	3 (25)	 		Lower	3 (25)	 		Diffuse	5 (41.7)	 	Axial distribution	Peripheral	4 (33.3)	 		Peripheral + central	8 (66.7)	 	Segmental distribution	Posterior	8 (66.7)	 		Anterior	2 (16.7)	 		Diffuse	2 (16.7)	 	Computed tomography features	Ground glass opacity	12 (100)	 		Consolidation	9 (75)	 		Interlobular septal thickening	5 (41.7)	 		Dilated small vessels in the lesion	9 (75)	 		Crazy-paving	2 (16.7)	 		Pleural effusion	2 (16.7)	 		Pericardial effusion	1 (8.3)	 	\nA 38-yr-old male patient presented with a dry cough and dyspnea and a history of kidney transplantation 15 yr previously. Computed tomography images show bilateral peripheral ground glass opacity (thin arrows) on the anterior side and an area of bilateral consolidation with air bronchogram (wide arrows) on the posterior side, predominantly in the lower lobes. Incidental pneumomediastinum is noted (thick-headed arrows). The patient died after 22 d in hospital.\nFig. 1\nChest computed tomography scores for each lobe and total lungs.\nTable 4	 	\nLobar anatomy	Ground glass opacity	Consolidation	Total score	 	Right upper lobe	1.5	0.16	1.66	 	Right middle lobe	1.66	0	1.66	 	Right lower lobe	1.41	0.91	2.32	 	Left upper lobe	1.41	0.08	1.49	 	Left lower lobe	1.58	0.75	2.33	 	Total lungs	7.58	1.9	9.46	 	\nThe initial CT scan on admission showed bilateral lung involvement in eight patients and unilateral involvement in four. The lower lobes were frequently involved, as observed in 11/12 of patients (Table 3 ). A combination of consolidation and GGO was the most predominant (75%) pattern, followed by GGO only (25%; Fig. 1 ). In terms of lesion distribution, a combination of peripheral plus central involvement was the most common. The mean lung involvement score was 9.5 +- 5.5 out of 20, which gives a mean estimate of 47.5 +- 27.8% for total lung involvement (Table 4 ).\nWe did not observe cavitation, cystic changes, or lymphadenopathy in any of the study population. Three patients had pleural or pericardial effusion or both. Four patients had a mildly elevated cardiothoracic ratio on chest CT. Pneumomediastinum was observed in two patients who had severe changes on chest CT, but neither was intubated or underwent noninvasive ventilation (NIV) before acquisition of the CT scan.\nA 49-yr-old woman presented with a dry cough, sore throat, headache, and a history of kidney transplantation 17 yr previously. (A,B) Computed tomography (CT) images obtained 3 d after the onset of symptoms show patchy ground-glass opacity in the right inferior lobe with slight central consolidation (long arrows). (C,D) CT images obtained 25 d after the onset of symptoms with secondary superimposed bacterial pneumonia show diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacity and consolidation with air bronchogram (wide arrows) predominantly in the upper lobes and bilateral mild plural effusion (thick-headed arrows). (E,F) CT images obtained 28 d after the onset of symptoms and intravenous antibiotic therapy show evolution of the area of consolidation with vacuolar signs (small black arrows) in the right upper lobe and fibrotic bands (long arrow) in the right lower lobe. The patient was discharged after 37 d.\nFig. 2\nFollow-up of the patients was performed to the study endpoints, which were death or complete recovery and discharge. Follow-up chest CT was carried out for three patients, while a portable chest X-ray was used for follow-up for the remaining nine. Follow-up imaging revealed progressive radiologic changes such as bilateral areas of air space opacity (Fig. 2 ).\nOf the 12 patients, ten were admitted to an intensive care unit, nine were intubated, eight died of severe COVID-19 pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and four were discharged after complete recovery. Three patients required neither NIV nor intubation. The median hospital stay was 15 d (interquartile range [IQR] 8.0-21.5), with a longer stay for patients who died (18.0 d, IQR 12.3-21.5) than for those who were discharged (7.0 d, IQR 6.0-28.3), but the difference was not statistically significant.\nDiscussion\nOwing to long-term immunosuppressive therapy, kidney transplant recipients are at higher risk of COVID-19 involvement in comparison to immunocompetent individuals. However, a few studies with small sample sizes have reported conflicting results for the characteristics of COVID-19 in these patients. In solid organ transplant recipients, the clinical presentation, imaging findings, laboratory data, and outcomes may differ from those for other adults and vary among patients.\nOn initial presentation, just one of our 12 cases had gastrointestinal symptoms; the most typical presentation was cough and fever, as for other adults. Guillen et al reported on a patient with a history of third kidney transplant who presented with vomiting and fever as a first symptom and was finally diagnosed with COVID-19 on follow-up.\nLaboratory findings revealed that although the majority of COVID-19 patients in the general population have leukopenia and lymphocytopenia (70%), normal white blood cell count was a more frequent finding in our series and leukopenia was detected in one-quarter of our subjects. On admission, lymphocytopenia was detected in 58.33% of our patients, whereas all cases had lymphocytopenia in another study. In contrast to our results, Fishman and Grossi reported that leukopenia and lymphopenia were the prevalent finding in immunocompromised transplant recipients.\nAccording to CT images, the most common pattern of lung involvement was bilateral involvement with a diffuse pattern and a posterior segmental distribution. GGO, a feature highly suggestive of COVID-19, was observed in all cases and consolidation in the majority of cases. A crazy-paving pattern was observed in two patients, which is consistent with late-phase COVID-19. One-third of our cases had unilateral involvement; in other studies, one case had bilateral GGO and one of five cases described by Zhang et al had unilateral involvement.\nAll the initial CT scan findings were compatible with a normal immune function except for unilateral involvement and consolidation, which were slightly more frequent in our series than in a previous multicenter study of 101 COVID-19 patients. Most patients in the later stages showed subpleural involvement as a less common finding. As the disease progresses, other uncommon findings include pleural/pericardial effusion, lymphadenopathy, cavitation, halo sign, and pneumothorax. The most common imaging features in severely ill patients were bilateral multilobar involvement and subsegmental consolidation.\nOur study revealed that interlobular septal thickening, multilobar patterns, consolidative lesions, and a high score for lung involvement were more frequent among the patients with poor outcome and complicated cases with ARDS. In addition, all cases with pleural and pericardial effusion or a crazy-paving appearance had poor outcome. Interestingly, two cases had pneumomediastinum as a rare finding on chest CT at the time of presentation, without any history of intubation or other predisposing procedures. Patients who survived had a shorter hospital stay and a unilateral peripheral pattern limited to only one zone of the lung, with none of the other findings mentioned for patients with poor outcome.\nIn conclusion, CT imaging features may have an important role in predicting COVID-19 outcomes for kidney transplant recipients. However, the majority of the findings are similar to those from other adult studies for the general population.\n  :  :  Conflicts of interest: The authors have nothing to disclose.\nReferences\nClinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China\nUnderstanding of COVID-19 based on current evidence\nEpidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study\nImmunosuppressed patients with pandemic influenza A 2009 (H1N1) virus infection\nRespiratory tract infections in the immunocompromised\nEpidemiological and clinical aspects of COVID-19; a narrative review\nClinical characteristics of 138 hospitalized patients with 2019 novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia in Wuhan, China\nRelation between chest CT findings and clinical conditions of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia: a multicenter study\nSupplementary data\nThe following is Supplementary data to this article: \nSupplementary material related to this article can be found, in the online version, at doi:https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eururo.2020.04.064.\n","References depth 1":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/s0140-6736(20)30154-9","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.\n\n Increasing quartile of NLR was statistically significantly associated with secondary outcome.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR is associated with outcomes in unselected critically ill patients.\n\n In patients with sepsis, there was no statistically significant relationship between NLR and mortality.\n\n Further investigation is required to increase understanding of the pathophysiology of this relationship and to validate these findings with data collected prospectively.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article

Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like

2019 was traced to a seafood wholesale market in Wuhan of China.\n Within a few weeks, a novel coronavirus tentatively named as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was announced by the World Health Organization.\n We performed bioinformatics analysis on a virus genome from a patient with 2019-nCoV infection and compared it with other related coronavirus genomes.\n Overall, the genome of 2019-nCoV has 89% nucleotide identity with bat SARS-like-CoVZXC21 and 82% with that of human SARS-CoV.\n The phylogenetic trees of their orf1a/b, Spike, Envelope, Membrane and Nucleoprotein also clustered closely with those of the bat, civet and human SARS coronaviruses.\n However, the external subdomain of Spike’s receptor binding domain of 2019-nCoV shares only 40% amino acid identity with other SARS-related coronaviruses.\n Remarkably, its orf3b encodes a completely novel short protein.\n Furthermore, its new orf8 likely encodes a secreted protein with an alpha-helix, following with a beta-sheet(s) containing six strands.\n Learning from the roles of civet in SARS and camel in MERS, hunting for the animal source of 2019-nCoV and its more ancestral virus would be important for understanding the origin and evolution of this novel lineage B betacoronavirus.\n These findings provide the basis for starting further studies on the pathogenesis, and optimizing the design of diagnostic, antiviral and vaccination strategies for this emerging infection.\n","id":"PMC7067204","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Taylor &amp; Francis","authors":[{"firstname":"Jasper

samples and serum antibody responses during infection by SARS-CoV-2: an observational cohort study","abstract":"Background\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes severe community and nosocomial outbreaks.\n\n Comprehensive data for serial respiratory viral load and serum antibody responses from patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are not yet available.\n\n Nasopharyngeal and throat swabs are usually obtained for serial viral load monitoring of respiratory infections but gathering these specimens can cause discomfort for patients and put health-care workers at risk.\n\n We aimed to ascertain the serial respiratory viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in posterior oropharyngeal (deep throat) saliva samples from patients with COVID-19, and serum antibody responses.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did a cohort study at two hospitals in Hong Kong.\n\n We included patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. We obtained samples of blood, urine, posterior oropharyngeal saliva, and rectal swabs.\n\n Serial viral load was ascertained by reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR).\n\n Antibody levels against the SARS-CoV-2 internal nucleoprotein (NP) and surface spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) were measured using EIA.\n\n Whole-genome sequencing was done to identify possible mutations arising during infection.\n\n\nFindings\nBetween Jan 22, 2020, and Feb 12, 2020, 30 patients were screened for inclusion, of whom 23 were included (median age 62 years [range 37–75]).\n\n The median viral load in posterior oropharyngeal saliva or other respiratory specimens at presentation was 5·2 log10 copies per mL (IQR 4·1–7·0).\n\n Salivary viral load was highest during the first week after symptom onset and subsequently declined with time (slope ?0·15, 95% CI ?0·19 to ?0·11; R2=0·71).\n\n In one patient, viral RNA was detected 25 days after symptom onset.\n\n Older age was correlated with higher viral load (Spearman's ?=0·48, 95% CI 0·074–0·75; p=0·020).\n\n For 16 patients with serum samples available 14 days or longer after symptom onset, rates of seropositivity were 94% for anti-NP IgG (n=15), 88% for anti-NP IgM (n=14), 100% for anti-RBD IgG (n=16), and 94% for anti-RBD IgM (n=15).\n\n Anti-SARS-CoV-2-NP or anti-SARS-CoV-2-RBD IgG levels correlated with virus neutralisation titre (R2&gt;0·9).\n\n No genome mutations were detected on serial samples.\n\n\nInterpretation\nPosterior oropharyngeal saliva samples are a non-invasive specimen more acceptable to patients and health-care workers.\n\n Unlike severe acute respiratory syndrome, patients with COVID-19 had the highest viral load near presentation, which could account for the fast-spreading nature of this epidemic.\n\n This finding emphasises the importance of stringent infection control and early use of potent antiviral agents, alone or in combination, for high-risk individuals.\n\n Serological assay can complement RT-qPCR for diagnosis.\n\n\nFunding\nRichard and Carol Yu, May Tam Mak Mei Yin, The Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Tong, Marina Lee, Government Consultancy Service, and Sanming Project of Medicine.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7158907","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Kelvin Kai-Wang","surname":"To","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Owen Tak-Yin","surname":"Tsang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wai-Shing","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Anthony Raymond","surname":"Tam","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tak-Chiu","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"David Christopher","surname":"Lung","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Cyril Chik-Yan","surname":"Yip","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jian-Piao","surname":"Cai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jacky Man-Chun","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Thomas Shiu-Hong","surname":"Chik","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Daphne Pui-Ling","surname":"Lau","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chris Yau-Chung","surname":"Choi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lin-Lei","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wan-Mui","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kwok-Hung","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jonathan Daniel","surname":"Ip","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Anthony Chin-Ki","surname":"Ng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rosana Wing-Shan","surname":"Poon","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Cui-Ting","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Vincent Chi-Chung","surname":"Cheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jasper Fuk-Woo","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ivan Fan-Ngai","surname":"Hung","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhiwei","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Honglin","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kwok-Yung","surname":"Yuen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30566-3","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study","abstract":"Background\nSince December, 2019, Wuhan, China, has experienced an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).\n\n Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (?18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020.

The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

SARS-CoV-2.\nMethods\nWe conducted a randomized, controlled, open-label trial involving hospitalized adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, which causes the respiratory illness Covid-19, and an oxygen saturation (Sao2) of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air or a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen (Pao2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) of less than 300 mm Hg.\n\n Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lopinavir–ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively) twice a day for 14 days, in addition to standard care, or standard care alone.\n\n The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement, defined as the time from randomization to either an improvement of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital, whichever came first.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 199 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent randomization; 99 were assigned to the lopinavir–ritonavir group, and 100 to the standard-care group.\n\n Treatment with lopinavir–ritonavir was not associated with a difference from standard care in the time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio for clinical improvement, 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to 1.72).\n\n Mortality at 28 days was similar in the lopinavir–ritonavir group and the standard-care group (19.2% vs.\n\n 25.0%; difference, ?5.8 percentage points; 95% CI, ?17.3 to 5.7).\n\n The percentages of patients with detectable viral RNA at various time points were similar.\n\n In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, lopinavir–ritonavir led to a median time to clinical improvement that was shorter by 1 day than that observed with standard care (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.91).\n\n Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common in the lopinavir–ritonavir group, but serious adverse events were more common in the standard-care group.\n\n Lopinavir–ritonavir treatment was stopped early in 13 patients (13.8%) because of adverse events.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn hospitalized adult patients with severe Covid-19, no benefit was observed with lopinavir–ritonavir treatment beyond standard care.\n\n

We describe 20 kidney transplant recipients (median age 59 years [inter quartile range 51-64 years], median age of transplant 13 years [9-20 years], baseline eGFR 36.5 [23-47.5]) with SARS-CoV2 induced pneumonia. At admission, all had immunosuppression withdrawn and were started on methylprednisolone 16 mg/day, all but one was commenced on antiviral therapy and hydroxychloroquine with doses adjusted for kidney function. At baseline, all patients presented fever but only one complained of difficulty in breathing. Half of patients showed chest radiographic evidence of bilateral infiltrates while the other half showed unilateral changes or no infiltrates. During a median follow-up of seven days, 87% experienced a radiological progression and among those 73% required escalation of oxygen therapy. Six patients developed acute kidney injury with one requiring hemodialysis. Six of 12 patients were treated with tocilizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody to the IL-6 receptor. Overall, five kidney transplant recipients died after a median period of 15 days [15-19] from symptom onset. These preliminary findings describe a rapid clinical deterioration associated with chest radiographic deterioration and escalating oxygen requirement in renal transplant recipients with SARS-Cov2 pneumonia. Thus, in this limited cohort of long-term kidney transplant patients, SARS-CoV-2 induced pneumonia is characterized by high risk of progression and significant mortality.\nGraphical abstract\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) infection is posing challenges to all the health systems in the world. The ideal therapeutic approach is still debated, and data on subgroups of patients at high risk are still scarce. We have developed an internal treatment protocol for the management of patients with SARS-CoV2 pneumonia who had undergone renal transplantation. Since the first days of March 2020, we reorganized our ward to admit patients with SARS-CoV2 pneumonia who had undergone kidney transplantation; we felt this rearrangement was necessary because our center acts as referral for a population of 1200 patients who have had kidney transplantation. Due to the onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic, acute transplantation surgery was suspended in our center from February 20, 2020. The first admission of a patient with SARS-CoV2 pneumonia who had undergone transplantation occurred on February 27, 2020, the second 6 days later, and subsequently up to March 24, 2020 (when this analysis was performed and patients' follow-up was censored), an average rate of 1.2 patients who had undergone kidney transplantation were admitted per day. We describe here the clinical course and renal outcomes of the first 20 patients who had undergone kidney transplantation admitted and followed in our unit with pneumonia secondary to SARS-CoV2 infection.\nResults\nBaseline clinical characteristics of 20 patients affected by SARS-CoV2 infection followed in our unit who had undergone kidney transplantation\nCharacteristics		 	Male/female (n)	16/4	 	Age (yr)	59 (51-64)	 	Comorbidities (%)		 	 Hypertension	85	 	 Ischemic cardiac disease	15	 	 Diabetes	15	 	 HCV infection	10	 	Kidney transplantation age (yr)	13 (9-20)	 	Time from symptoms onset to admission (d)	5.5 (3.3-8)	 	Baseline serum creatinine (mg/dl)	1.95 (1.5-2.8)	 	Baseline eGFR (ml/min)a	36.5 (23-47.5)	 	Baseline immunosuppression (n)		 	 CNIs	19/20	 	 MMF	14/20	 	 Low-dose glucocorticoidb	13/20	 	 mTORi	2/20	 	SARS-CoV2 infection symptoms onset (%)		 	 Temperature &gt;37.5  C	100	 	 Cough	50	 	 Gastrointestinal symptoms	15	 	 Pharyngitis	10	 	 Shortness of breath	5	 	 Myalgia	5	 	Chest X-ray at hospital admission (%)		 	 No infiltrates	15	 	 Unilateral infiltrates	35	 	 Bilateral infiltrates	50	 	Blood tests at hospital admission		 	 WBCs (NV: 4.00-10.80 x 103/mul)	5470 (4115-6193)	 	 Neutrophils (NV: 1.50-8.00 x 103/mul)	3700 (2280-4500)	 	 Lymphocytes (NV: 0.90-4.00 x 103/mul)	1170 (620-1305)	 	 Platelets (NV: 130-400 x 103/mul)	196,000 (119,000-202,000)	 	 LDH (NV: 135-225 U/l)	231 (190-260)	 	 CPK (NV: 39-308 U/l)	69 (44-121)	 	 AST (NV: 18-54 U/l)	37 (26-35)	 	 ALT (NV: 10-50 U/l)	23 (16-30)	 	 Bilirubin (NV: &lt;1.20 mg/dl)	0.8 (0.4-0.9)	 	 CRP (NV: &lt;5.0 mg/l)	49 (19-62)	 	 Procalcitonin (NV: &lt;0.5 ng/ml)	0.22 (0.1-0.35)	 	 Ferritin (NV: 30-400 mug/l)	831 (284-882)	 	 Fibrinogen (NV: 170-410 mg/d)	461 (343-614)	 	 D-dimer (NV: &lt;232 ng/ml)	279 (277-563)	 	 Urea (NV: 17-49 mg/dl)	46 (48-106)	 	 Creatinine (NV: 0.70-1.20 mg/dl)	1.8 (1.7-3.5)	 	Antiviral therapy (n of 19 patients)		 	 Lopinavir/ritonavir	15	 	 Darunavir + ritonavir	4	 	Ventilation requirement at hospital admission		 	 No oxygen	7	 	 LOR	8	 	 HOR	5	 	 NIV	0	 	 MV	0	 	\nALT, alanine transaminase; AST, aspartate transaminase; CNI, calcineurin inhibitor; CPK, creatine phosphokinase; CRP, C-reactive protein; eGFR, estimated glomerular filtration rate; HCV, hepatitis C virus; HOR, high oxygen requirement; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; LOR, low oxygen requirement; MMF, mofetil mycophenolate; mTORi, mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor; MV, mechanical ventilation; NIV, non-invasive ventilation; NV, normal value; SARS-CoV2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; WBC, white blood cell.\nData are reported as percentages or median (interquartile range) unless otherwise indicated.

These patients had a median inpatient stay of 7 days (interquartile range [IQR], 4-15), and the main baseline clinical characteristics are shown in Tables 1 and 2 . Briefly, all patients presented with fever; however, only 1 of the 20 complained of dyspnea; 50% of the patients who had undergone transplantation had radiographic changes of bilateral infiltrates on admission, while the remaining 50% showed unilateral changes or no infiltrates; 7 did not require supplemental oxygen at admission.\nAll patients had their usual transplant immunosuppression withdrawn and were started on methylprednisolone 16 mg or equivalent dose of prednisone, and 19 of the 20 received antiviral therapy and hydroxychloroquine as per our protocol. As antiviral therapy is known to interfere with calcineurin inhibitor metabolism, in 4 patients, tacrolimus levels were monitored after these therapeutic changes were instituted. The median trough values before antiviral therapy were 7.05 ng/ml (IQR, 5.5-8.6): 1 patient had the level rechecked after 3 days with no change compared with baseline; 1 patient had the level rechecked 4 and 5 days after admission (-17% and -18% compared with baseline); 1 was rechecked 6 days after admission (-12% compared with baseline); and 1 was rechecked 8 days after admission (-21% compared with baseline). The median times from symptom onset and admission to these therapeutic changes were, respectively, 5 days (IQR, 3-8.25) for antiviral therapy and 0 days (IQR, 0-0) for hydroxychloroquine. During the follow-up, 1 patient had hydroxychloroquine withdrawn due to toxicity (nausea, vomiting); among the treated patients no prolongation of the cardiac QTc interval compared with baseline or cardiac arrhythmias were observed. Antibiotics were administered to 11 of the 20 patients (55%): cephalosporins in 64%; beta-lactams in 36%; fluoroquinolones in 25%; carbapenems in 10%; and glycopeptides in 5%. During hospitalization, chest radiographs were repeated in 15 patients and radiological findings worsened in 13 of those 15 (87%). In the 13 individuals with worsening radiological findings, 11 (85%) required an escalation of the oxygen supplemental therapy, including 1 patient switched from regular breathing to low oxygen requirement, 3 from regular breathing to high oxygen requirement, 3 from low to high oxygen requirement, 2 from high oxygen requirement to non-invasive ventilation, and 2 from high oxygen requirement to mechanical ventilation. The changes of the main blood tests compared with baseline are shown in Supplementary Figure S1.\nAdditional anti-inflammatory therapy with dexamethasone or tocilizumab, respectively, was given to 11 (55%) and 6 of the 20 patients (30%) (see Supplementary Methods for protocol details); in these patients, respectively, 4 (36%) and 2 (33%) subsequently died.\nCharacteristics of 6 patients with SARS-CoV2 pneumonia who had undergone kidney transplantation treated with tocilizumab and outcome after treatment\nPatient	Day of tocilizumab administration	Oxygen requirement at tocilizumab	Follow-up after tocilizumab (d)	Oxygen requirement after tocilizumab	Chest X-ray improvement	Outcome	 	1	6	NIV	11	HOR	No	Inpatient	 	2	6	HOR	10	MV	No	Death	 	3	7	LOR	9	Room air	No	Discharged	 	4	3	HOR	4	HOR	Yes	Inpatient	 	5	5	NIV	3	NIV	N/A	Death	 	6	4	HOR	3	LOR	Yes	Inpatient	 	\nHOR, high-flux oxygen; LOR, low-flux oxygen; MV, mechanical ventilation; N/A, not available; NIV, non-invasive ventilation; SARS-CoV2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.\nThe characteristics of the patients treated with tocilizumab are shown in Table 3 ; among these 6 patients, 3 (50%) experienced a reduction of the oxygen requirements and 2 (33%) showed amelioration of the radiological findings. Two patients who were treated with tocilizumab eventually died and 1 was discharged from hospital 9 days after the administration of tocilizumab.\nIn terms of kidney function, the medium creatinine level at admission was +17% (IQR, 12%-26%; range, 0%-143%) compared with baseline, and the highest creatinine level observed during the follow-up was +33% (IQR, 13%-59%; range, 0%-157%) compared with baseline; 6 of 20 patients developed acute kidney injury and 1 of those 6 required hemodialysis.\nDuring follow-up of the 20 patients, 4 (20%) required intensive care and 3 of these individuals subsequently died. Overall, 5 patients died after a median of 11 days from admission (IQR, 11-14 days) and 15 days (IQR, 15-19 days) from symptom onset; of these 5 patients, 4 died from complications of the respiratory failure secondary to SARS-CoV2 infection and 1 died of probable bacterial sepsis (fever, rise of C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin) despite a satisfactory recovery from SARS-CoV2 pneumonia-induced respiratory failure, need for intensive care unit care, and treatment with dexamethasone and tocilizumab.\nThree patients were discharged, after 7 days in 1 case and after 16 in the 2 remaining cases; at discharge, creatinine levels compared with baseline were 3.6 versus 2.1, 2.3 versus 2.5, and 2.1 versus 1.5 mg/dl. In terms of immunosuppressive therapy, 2 patients were discharged receiving methylprednisolone 16 mg/d and 1 with methylprednisolone 12 mg/d.\nDiscussion\nSARS-CoV2 infection is challenging health care systems around the world. The mortality of the disease has been proposed to be around the 2.3% with age and comorbidities such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases, hypertension, and cancer being associated with worse prognoses.   Immunosuppression and chronic kidney disease may represent additional risk factors, although specific data are not available at the moment. Here we reported the clinical characteristics and the outcomes of the first 20 patients affected by SARS-CoV2 pneumonia at our center who had received kidney transplantation. Despite on average a relatively benign onset of the disease, a large proportion of the patients displayed worsening chest radiographs and required an escalation of the supplemental oxygen. Of note, 25% of the patients died despite an aggressive approach to immunosuppression withdrawal and early commencement of antiviral therapy.\nThe role of lopinavir/ritonavir in SARS-CoV2 management is debated, with some data supporting a greater benefit with early start compared with a delayed commencement; our cohort was started on antiviral therapy a median of 5.5 days after symptom onset. Lopinavir/ritonavir may interact with calcineurin inhibitors impacting on their level: the 4 patients of our cohort with serial calcineurin inhibitor monitoring confirmed that; of note none of these patients died and 3 have been discharged.\nReports suggest a role for hydroxychloroquine treatment in reducing the viral load. In our cohort, 19 patients received this drug although toxicity led to treatment withdrawal in 1 case.\nHydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir may interact causing a prolongation of the cardiac QTc interval; however, none of the patients in this series experienced this complication. Preliminary data and understanding of the pathogenesis of the pneumonia secondary to SARS-CoV2 infection suggest a central role of inflammatory cytokines in inducing the rapid clinical deterioration in association with worsening chest radiographs and escalating oxygen requirement, observed in an average of 7 to 10 days from the symptom onset. In this context, glucocorticoids with or without tocilizumab have been suggested to be a therapeutic strategy. Our subgroup of patients treated by this approach experienced a poor outcome, although encouraging signals in terms of potential beneficial effects were observed in the patients treated with tocilizumab: 50% reduced oxygen therapy requirement and 33% experiencing improvement of radiological changes. Despite that, 2 patients died. Our results are too preliminary and the sample size too small to draw firm conclusions.\nThe high mortality rate of this population suggests aggressive management is needed for patients with SARS-CoV2 infection who had received kidney transplantation, in particular early hospitalization should be considered in case of pneumonia. Furthermore, more effective treatment protocols need to be identified.\nOur study has limitations: the sample size is small and the median follow-up time is short. Therefore, our findings are preliminary and will need to be confirmed in larger cohorts with longer follow-up times. Some strengths may be acknowledged as well; in particular, the monocentric approach and the homogeneity of the clinical treatment employed.\nIn conclusion, patients with SARS-CoV2 pneumonia who had undergone kidney transplantation may present with an unfavorable disease course and a poor outcome; hospitalization is required and repeat chest X-rays are advisable. Clinical management needs to be improved to have an impact on the prognosis of these patients.\nMethods\nAll the patients with SARS-CoV2 infection admitted in the Nephrology Unit of the Spedali Civili Hospital of Brescia who had undergone kidney transplantation have been included. The therapeutic approach followed our already-published protocol. In brief, all admitted patients had immunosuppresion withdrawn and were commenced on methylprednisolone 16 mg/d. Antiviral therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir plus hydroxychloroquine (dose adjusted for kidney function) was considered in all patients if not contraindicated. In case of shortage of lopinavir/ritonavir, darunavir and ritonavir have been employed (see the Supplementary Methods). Patients experiencing clinical deterioration after at least 7 days from symptom onset or no temperature for &gt;72 hours but with escalating oxygen requirements or progression of the chest radiography and no signs of bacterial infection were considered for dexamethasone (20 mg/d for 5 days, then 10 mg/d for 5 days) and up to 2 tocilizumab infusions at intervals of 12 to 24 hours (8 mg/kg of body weight, maximum dose per infusion 800 mg). Details on the indications for dexamethasone and tocilizumab have been provided in the Supplementary Methods.\nOxygen requirements have been categorized as follow: no oxygen needs; low oxygen requirement, from nasal cannula up to Venturi mask with FiO2 of 0.5, high oxygen requirement, including Venturi mask with FiO2 of 0.6, reservoir mask with oxygen at 15 l/min, and high-flow nasal ventilation; non-invasive ventilation; and mechanical ventilation. Acute kidney injury was defined as per previous publications. \nConsidering the well-documented effects of lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine on increasing the cardiac QTc interval, electrocardiograms were performed every 2 to 3 days. In case of prolongation compared with baseline, dose reduction was performed.\nDue to the small sample size, only descriptive statistics have been performed, results are expressed as count (percentage) for categorical variables and median and IQR for continuous variables.\nAccording to the Italian regulations, ethical approval for the study has been obtained.\nDisclosure\nAll the authors declared no competing interests.\nReferences\nCao B, Wang Y, Wen D, et al.

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

with duration of fever.\n\n Generally, higher values of NLR and MLR indicated larger probabilities for bacterial infection and low probabilities for viral infection.\n\n Patients with septicemia had significantly higher NLR compared to patients with other bacterial infections with fever for less than one week.\n\n White blood cell counts, neutrophil counts, and C-reactive proteins did not differ significantly between septicemia and the other bacterial infection groups.\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par4'>NLR is a more useful diagnostic tool to identify patients with septicemia than other more commonly used diagnostic blood tests.\n\n NLR and MLR may be useful in the diagnosis of bacterial infection among patients hospitalized for fever.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5488068","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Springer Berlin

mortality in critical illness: an observational cohort study","abstract":"Introduction\nThe neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a biological marker that has been shown to be associated with outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.\n\n Increasing quartile of NLR was statistically significantly associated with secondary outcome.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR is associated with outcomes in unselected critically ill patients.\n\n In patients with sepsis, there was no statistically significant relationship between NLR and mortality.\n\n Further investigation is required to increase understanding of the pathophysiology of this relationship and to validate these findings with data collected prospectively.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article

The risk of ARDS and death is significant for patients requiring hospital admission at disease diagnosis.\nGraphical abstract\nThe impact of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic in subgroups of patients has yet to be determined. In Brescia, Italy, we have developed a standardized protocol when approaching patients on maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) and kidney transplant recipients, respectively. Reports would suggest a more severe disease course in patients with chronic kidney disease, although outcomes in MHD patients are still unclear, with earlier small case series suggesting a milder course. Management of MHD patients in the context of an epidemic poses several challenges: this group of patients usually requires caregiver assistance and transportation from home to the dialysis units, and they must spend time in crowded waiting areas before and after treatment. Moreover, MHD patients are usually old and affected by several comorbidities that are known to be associated with high risk of poor outcomes in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\nThe Lombardy region in general, and Brescia in particular, have been severely hit by the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, and this has generated several logistical and clinical challenges for the dialysis units of the Brescia Renal COVID Task Force. Here, we describe the characteristics and outcomes of the MHD patients affected by COVID-19 and followed in 4 dialysis units that are part of the Brescia Renal COVID Task Force.\nResults\nHemodialysis patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in 4 dialysis centers of the Brescia Renal COVID Task Force, Brescia, Italy\nCenter	Positive patients admitted	Positive outpatients	Positive overall	Overall population	Percentage of positive patients	 	Brescia	25	22	49	302	16	 	Chiari	16	14	30	155	19	 	Manerbio	12	0	12	99	12	 	Montichiari	4	1	5	87	6	 	TOTAL	57	37	94	643	15	 	\nCOVID, coronavirus disease; SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.\nBaseline clinical characteristics of 94 hemodialysis patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection and followed within 4 centers of the Brescia Renal COVID Task Force, Brescia, Italy\nCharacteristics	All patients (94)	Outpatients (37)	Admitted (57)	P valuea	 	Male/female	62/32	24/13	39/18	0.82	 	Age (yr)	72 (62-79)	67 (60-77)	73 (64-80)	0.17	 	Cause of ESRD					 	 Not determined	40 of 94 (43)	8 of 37 (22)	32 of 57 (56)	0.001	 	 Glomerulonephritis	19 of 94 (19)	15 of 37 (41)	4 of 57 (7)	0.0001	 	 Genetic diseases	15 of 94 (16)	6 of 37 (16)	9 of 57 (16)	1	 	 Diabetes	11 of 94 (12)	3 of 37 (8)	8 of 57 (14)	0.52	 	 Other	9 of 94 (10)	5 of 37 (14)	4 of 57 (7)	0.31	 	Comorbidities					 	 Hypertension	93%	35 of 7 (95)	52 of 57 (91)	0.7	 	 Diabetes	43%	13 of 37 (35)	27 of 57 (47)	0.29	 	 Vascular disease	23%	7 of 37 (19)	15 of 57 (26)	0.46	 	 Cardiac failure	18%	1 of 37 (3)	16 of 57 (28)	0.002	 	 Ischemic cardiac disease	17%	4 of 37 (11)	12 of 57 (21)	0.27	 	 Cancer	12%	5 of 37 (14)	6 of 57 (11)	0.75	 	 COPD	11%	6 of 37 (16)	4 of 57 (7)	0.18	 	 Other	17%	4 of 37 (11)	13 of 57 (23)	0.18	 	Hemodialysis vintage (yr)	3 (1-6)	2 (1-7)	3.9 (1.6-6.4)	0.19	 	Hemodialysis frequency					 	 2 times week	12 of 94 (13)	3 of 37 (8)	9 of 57 (16)	0.35	 	 3 times a week	82 of 94 (87)	34 of 37 (92)	48 of 57 (84)	0.35	 	Hemodialysis modality					 	 HD	69 of 94 (73)	26 of 37 (70)	43 of 57 (75)	0.64	 	 HDF	23 of 94 (25)	11 of 37 (30)	12 of 57 (21)	0.46	 	 AFB	2 of 94 (2)	0	2 of 57 (4)	0.52	 	SARS-CoV-2 infection symptoms at disease onset					 	 Temperature (&gt;37.5  C)	68%	16 of 37 (43)	49 of 57 (86)	&lt;0.0001	 	 Cough	23%	6 of 37 (16)	16 of 57 (28)	0.22	 	 Gastrointestinal symptoms	6%	1 of 37 (3)	5 of 57 (9)	0.4	 	 Pharyngitis	2%	1 of 37 (3)	1 of 57 (2)	1	 	 Shortness of breath	25%	1 of 37 (3)	22 of 57 (39)	&lt;0.0001	 	 Myalgia	17%	2 of 37 (5)	14 of 57 (25)	0.02	 	Baseline chest X-ray					 	 No infiltrates	30%	15 of 31 (48)	11 of 53 (21)	0.01	 	 Unilateral infiltrates	25%	7 of 31 (23)	13 of 53 (25)	1	 	 Bilateral infiltrates	45%	9 of 31 (29)	29 of 53 (55)	0.03	 	Baseline blood tests					 	 WBC (NV 4.00-10.80 x 103/ul)	5075 (3943-6470)	5960 (4095-6865)	4760 (3910-5645)	0.08	 	 Neutrophils (NV 1.50-8.00 x 103/ul)	3505 (2688-4770)	4400 (2760-5330)	3430 (2680-4080)	0.1	 	 Lymphocytes (NV 0.90-4.00 x 103/ul)	745 (550-1085)	900 (600-1200)	623 (510-1000)	0.05	 	 Platelets (NV 130-400 x 103/ul)	162,000 (126,000-229,500)	202,000 (124,250-263,750)	151,000 (127,000-181,000)	0.02	 	 LDH (NV 135-225 U/l)	254 (193-354)	218 (187-303)	352 (219-404)	0.004	 	 CPK (NV 39-308 U/l)	64 (38-138)	51.5 (33-143)	96 (49-138)	0.33	 	 AST (NV 18-54 U/l)	23 (17-35)	19 (12-24)	27 (19-46)	0.0002	 	 ALT (NV 10-50 U/l)	17 (11-25)	14.5 (10-21)	19 (13-29)	0.04	 	 Bilirubin (NV &lt; 1.20 mg/dl)	0.3 (0.28-0.4)	0.28 (0.21-0.37)	0.3 (0.3-0.5)	0.05	 	 CRP (NV &lt; 5.0 mg/l)	42.9 (10-82)	12.8 (3.7-33.8)	60 (19-89)	0.0004	 	Time from symptom onset to antiviral therapy initiation	4 (1-6)	5 (3-5)	3 (1-6.5)	0.05	 	Time from RT-PCR positivity to antiviral therapy initiation	2 (0-4)	3 (2-5)	1 (0-3)	0.0003	 	Antiviral therapy					 	 Lopinavir/ritonavir	19 of 94 (20)	0 of 37 (0)	19 of 57 (33)		 	 Darunavir + ritonavir	41 of 94 (44)	15 of 37 (41)	26 of 57 (46)		 	 Hydroxychloroquine	72 of 94 (77)	28 of 37 (76)	44 of 57 (77)		 	\nData are reported as n (%) for categorical variables and median (interquartile range) for continuous variables.

Although 3 centers limited the viral testing to only those patients showing symptoms suggestive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, the hemodialysis center of the ASST Spedali Civili of Brescia performed RT-PCR in its entire MHD population (patients with symptoms and patients without symptoms). The positivity rates were not substantially different between these approaches (14% vs. 16%, respectively). Patients testing positive were either triaged to the hospital or back to their dialysis facility based on the clinical judgement of the caring physician, mainly according to the severity of the symptoms shown. The main clinical characteristics of the overall MHD population with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the subgroups managed as outpatient or in hospital, are shown in Table 2 . The median time from symptom onset to positive RT-PCR was 2 days (interquartile range [IQR], 0-3). Patients that needed to be admitted showed a higher proportion of symptoms compared to the ones not requiring hospitalization (46% vs. 14%).\nOutpatient management\nThirty-seven of 94 (39%) patients were managed as outpatients, for a median follow-up of 8 days (IQR, 6-11). Among the group managed as outpatients, 18 of 37 (49%) were asymptomatic at disease diagnosis, while the remaining patients experienced mild symptoms. Among the asymptomatic patients, in 13 of 18 (72%), a chest X-ray was negative, and unilateral and bilateral infiltrates were detected respectively in 3 of 18 (17%) and 2 of 18 (11%). Detailed patient characteristics are shown in Table 2.\nAntiviral therapy and/or hydroxychloroquine were employed in 28 of 37 (76%) patients for a median duration of 4 days (IQR, 3-8). Antibiotics were employed in 25 of 37 (68%): macrolides in 56%, cephalosporins in 48%, carbapenems in 8%, glycopeptides in 8%, aminoglycosides in 8%, beta-lactams in 4%, and fluoroquinolones in 4%. A total of 4 of 37 (11%) received prophylactic heparin, and 3 of 37 (8%) were on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antagonists.\nOne patient had to withdraw from taking hydroxychloroquine due to vomiting. No other adverse event due to the treatment was documented in this patient group.\nDuring follow-up, 7 of 37 (19%) patients experienced a new onset/worsening of the interstitial pneumonia, 3 of 37 (8%) died, 2 of 37 (5%) developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and 2 of 37 (5%) had to be hospitalized. In addition, 5 of 37 patients (14%) developed cough, 5 of 37 (14%) myalgia, 4 of 37 (11%) fever, and 3 of 37 (8%) gastrointestinal symptoms during follow up.\nPatients who were asymptomatic at baseline, compared to the symptomatic ones, were less likely to develop ARDS (0 of 18 vs. 2 of 19), develop a new onset or worsening of pneumonia (1 of 18 vs. 6 of 19), and to die (0 of 18 vs. 3 of 19).\nHospitalized patients\nFifty-seven patients were admitted after a median time from symptom onset and from positive RT-PCR test results of 4 (IQR, 1-7) and 2 days (IQR, 1-3), respectively. Median follow-up was 8 days (IQR, 4.8-15). Detailed characteristics of this population are shown in Table 2. Antiviral therapy was employed in 45 of 57 (79%), with 13 of 45 patients (29%) experiencing adverse events: 7 diarrhea, 4 an increase in liver enzymes, 3 prolongation of QTc interval, 2 atrial fibrillation, 1 gastrointestinal bleeding, 1 coagulation alterations, and 1 skin rash. The median duration of lopinavir/ritonavir or darunavir + ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine treatments were 7 days (IQR, 5-12) and 5 days (IQR, 3-7), respectively. Antibiotics were administered in 55 of 57 patients: macrolides in 40%, cephalosporins in 49%, carbapenems in 15%, glycopeptides in 20%, aminoglycosides in 7%, beta-lactams in 25%, and fluoroquinolones in 24%. Thirty-one of 57 (54%) received prophylactic heparin, and 11 of 57 (19%) were on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antagonists.\nForty-five of 57 patients (79%) developed ARDS; 24 of 57 (42%) died after a median of 6 days (IQR, 3.8-9.5) from admission and a median of 9 days (IQR, 7-10) from onset of symptoms. Eleven of 57 (19%) patients were discharged after a median of 8 days (IQR, 6.5-13) from admission and 15 days (IQR, 12.5-17.5) from onset of symptoms. Among the patients who died, the cause of death was respiratory failure secondary to ARDS in 15 of 24 (63%), bacterial sepsis in 4 of 9, and sudden death of unknown origin in 5 of 9. Serial chest X-rays were performed in 27 of 57 (47%) patients; among those patients, 20 of 27 (74%) showed chest X-ray worsening compared to baseline.\nDexamethasone was administered to 18 of 57 (32%) patients due to respiratory deterioration; 2 of 18 of these patients also received tocilizumab. In this group, 5 of 18 patients (28%) died. Of 9 patients whose response to glucocorticoids was assessable at the moment of data analyses, 2 of 9 showed stabilization of the arterial partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FIO2 ratio) or chest X-ray improvement, whereas the remaining patients did not improve. Regarding the 2 tocilizumab-treated patients, response was assessable in only one, with no improvements in chest X-ray or PaO2/FIO2.\nFactors associated with risk of ARDS and death\nUnivariate analyses of the association between clinical characteristics and the risk of ARDS or death in hemodialysis patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection\nVariable	Outcome: ARDS	Outcome: death	 	OR (95% CI)	P value	OR (95% CI)	P value	 	Sex	0.68 (0.29-1.61)	0.39	1.05 (0.41-2.78)	0.93	 	History of hypertension	0.37 (0.05-1.83)	0.25	0.27 (0.05-1.31)	0.1	 	History of cardiac failure	6.22 (1.85-28.6)	0.007	1.04 (0.3-3.2)	0.94	 	History of diabetes	1.7 (0.75-3.9)	0.21	1.7 (0.69-4.2)	0.25	 	History of peripheral vascular disease	1.27 (0.49-3.36)	0.63	0.91 (0.29-2.56)	0.86	 	History of ischemic cardiac disease	5.61 (1.65-25.9)	0.01	3.11 (1.02-9.6)	0.05	 	History of COPD	1 (0.26-3.84)	1	1.07 (0.22-4.2)	0.92	 	History of cancer	1.88 (0.53-7.64)	0.34	1.5 (0.36-5.4)	0.55	 	Type dialysis (HDF vs. HD)	0.43 (0.16-1.14)	0.097	1.12 (0.38-3.05)	0.83	 	Age (&gt;70 yr vs. &lt;=70 yr)	2.18 (0.96-5)	0.065	1.85 (0.75-4.78)	0.18	 	Fever at disease diagnosis	18.2 (5.6-82.4)	0.000013	18.7 (3.62-123)	0.005	 	Cough at disease diagnosis	1.61 (0.62-4.37)	0.33	3.5 (1.28-9.7)	0.01	 	Shortness of breath at disease diagnosis	18.17 (4.8-119.5)	0.0002	5.3 (2-15)	0.001	 	Myalgia or fatigue at disease diagnosis	5.6 (1.65-25.9)	0.01	2.26 (0.72-6.9)	0.15	 	Infiltrates at chest X-ray at disease diagnosis	4.4 (1.67-13)	0.004	2.9 (0.95-11)	0.08	 	WBC (&lt;=5 x103/ul vs. &gt;5 x103/ul)	1.2 (0.52-1.8)	0.66	1.82 (0.73-4.6)	0.2	 	Lymphocytes (&lt;=0.75 x103/ul vs. &gt;0.75 x103/ul)	1.76 (0.75-4.2)	0.19	1.5 (0.59-3.9)	0.4	 	Platelets (&lt;=150 x103/ul vs. &gt;150 x103/ul)	1.43 (0.62-3.37)	0.41	1.9 (0.75-4.8)	0.17	 	LDH (&gt;250 U/l vs. &lt;=250 U/l)	0.99 (0.32-3.11)	0.99	0.71 (0.18-2.7)	0.62	 	AST (&gt;25 U/l vs. &lt;=25 U/l)	2.81 (1.08-7.6)	0.04	1.85 (0.66-5.3)	0.24	 	ALT (&gt;20 U/l vs. &lt;=20 U/l)	1.73 (0.67-4.69)	0.25	2.5 (0.88-7)	0.085	 	CRP (&gt;50 mg/l vs. &lt;=50 mg/l)	4.68 (1.83-12.7)	0.002	6 (2.1-19)	0.001	 	Antiviral therapy	1.29 (0.48-3.55)	0.62	0.39 (0.14-1.11)	0.08	 	Time from symptoms to antiviral commencement (&lt;=5 vs. &gt;5)	2.09 (0.65-7.51)	0.23	0.55 (0.11-2.1)	0.41	 	Hydroxychloroquine	1.16 (0.44-3.12)	0.76	0.44 (0.16-1.24)	0.12	 	\nBold data refer to statistically significant P values.\nALT, alanine aminotransferase; ARDS, acute respiratory distress syndrome; AST, aspartate aminotransferase; CI, confidence interval; COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder; CRP, C-reactive protein; HD, hemodialysis; HDF, hemodiafiltration; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; OR, odds ratio; SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; WBC, white blood cell.\nIn univariate analyses, cardiac failure (odds ratio [OR], 6.22 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.85-28.6]; P = 0.007), ischemic heart disease (OR, 5.61 [95% CI, 1.65-25.9]; P = 0.01), fever at disease diagnosis (OR, 18.2 [95% CI, 5.6-82.44]; P = 0.000013), shortness of breath at disease diagnosis (OR, 18.17 [95% CI, 4.8-119.5]; P = 0.0002), myalgia or fatigue at disease diagnosis (OR, 5.6 [95% CI, 1.65-25.9]; P = 0.01), infiltrates at the baseline chest X-ray (OR, 4.4 [95% CI, 1.67-13]; P = 0.004), higher aspartate aminotransferase levels (OR, 2.81 [95% CI, 1.08-7.6]; P = 0.04), and higher C-reactive protein levels (OR, 4.68 [95% CI, 1.83-12.7]; P = 0.002) were associated with the risk of developing ARDS.

The predictions regarding COVID-19-associated mortality are changing as new information is gathered, although comorbidities such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases, hypertension, and cancer are consistently associated with worse prognoses.   We have reported recently that hospitalized kidney transplant recipients tended to have a poor prognosis, with a mortality rate of 25%, and another group observed that when such patients did not require hospital admission, they experienced a more favorable outcome. \nThe prognosis of hemodialysis patients with COVID-19 is still unclear, and more data are desperately needed. In our cohort, including 4 centers that are part of the Brescia Renal COVID Task Force, we have identified 94 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. As expected, infected MHD patients who do not require hospital admission experienced a better disease course compared to patients who required hospitalization. Nevertheless, 5% of the patients treated in the outpatient setting subsequently required admission. There was also substantially less use of antiviral medications in patients managed in the outpatient setting, although the proportion of patients receiving hydroxychloroquine was similar between the 2 groups. These findings should be taken into account when interpreting the results, as it was the managing physician's decision to start medications. Although the lower rate of antiviral use was associated with a lower incidence of adverse events in the outpatient group, whether this may be the result of less-frequent antiviral use rather than a better overall disease profile needs to be clarified. Finally, in our cohort, only a few patients were treated with glucocorticoids and tocilizumab, which does not allow us to draw any conclusions on the potential efficacy of these treatments.\nThe disease severity of the SARS-CoV-2 infection is highly variable, and a significant proportion of infected patients appear to experience only mild disease or no symptoms at all in our cohort. Notably, the overall case fatality rate of our population was higher compared to that in the general Italian and Chinese population (28% vs. 7.2% vs. 2.3%).   The finding of worse outcome of hemodialysis patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection may be explained by a high prevalence of comorbidities, as well as other risk factors related to end-stage renal disease per se. \nOur study also provides some preliminary information on factors associated with the risk of ARDS and death. The presence of cardiovascular disease and severe inflammation were predictive of worse outcomes. Notably, these factors are not specific for the hemodialysis population, as cardiac comorbidities, fever, and older age have already been described as prognostic factors in the general population with SARS-CoV-2 infection.   \nOur results should be interpreted with some caution. The median follow-up period was 8 days; center bias cannot be ruled out; symptoms severity was not collected; and the relatively small sample size of our cohort may have had an impact on the generalizability of our analyses. The strengths of our study include a shared management approach characterized by relative data homogeneity, and detailed data collection made possible by an unprecedented commitment of the members of our task force.\nIn conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 infection in maintenance hemodialysis patients presents with a wide range of symptoms. The data represented herein suggest a strikingly higher mortality rate compared to that in the general population, although the risk factors for disease severity are similar. Further data collection and follow-up are necessary to gain a complete picture of the spectrum of COVID-19 in maintenance dialysis patients.\nMethods\nFrom March 1, 2020 to April 3, 2020, we enrolled all hemodialysis patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who were managed within 4 hemodialysis hubs (Table 1) of the Brescia Renal COVID Task Force. Each one of these dialysis centers implemented general prevention measures to safeguard their population. Three of the 4 hemodialysis hubs reserved the RT-PCR test for only those patients showing symptoms suggestive of the disease, after their referral to dedicated clinics. Conversely, starting on March 20th, the Brescia dialysis unit performed RT-PCR analysis on all patients followed.\nThe therapeutic strategy followed our protocol. Antiviral therapy based on lopinavir/ritonavir associated to hydroxychloroquine (with dose adjusted according to kidney function) was considered for all patients, if not contraindicated. In cases of shortage of lopinavir/ritonavir, darunavir and ritonavir were employed. Patients experiencing clinical deterioration after at least 7 days following symptom onset, or no fever for &gt;72 hours, with escalating oxygen requirements, progression of the chest X-ray, and no signs of bacterial infection, were considered for dexamethasone (20 mg/d for 5 days, then 10 mg/d for 5 days) and up to 2 tocilizumab infusions at an interval of 12-24 hours (8 mg/kg of body weight, maximum dose per infusion 800 mg).\nConsidering the well-known potential of lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine for increasing QTc, a baseline EKG was performed before therapy commencement and afterwards, every 2-3 days; in case of QTc prolongation, a reduction or discontinuation of treatment was considered in a case-by-case manner.\nARDS and cardiac failure have been defined as reported by others.   The decision as to whether to admit a patient was made by the attending physician according to symptom severity or signs of respiratory failure.\nEthical approval for this study was obtained according to Italian regulations.\nStatistical analyses\nStatistical analysis was performed using R software (https://www.r-project.org) and GraphPad Prism 7. Results are expressed as the number and percentage for categorical variables, and the median (IQR) for continuous variables.\nChanges in variables were compared by a related sample Wilcoxon test; proportions of patients were compared using a chi2 or Fisher test, as appropriate.\nUnivariate and multiple logistic regression models were used to assess the ability of some predefined clinical characteristics to predict the risk of ARDS or death. All the statistically significant predictors at univariate analysis were entered in a multivariate model. Finally, the best multivariate model was identified by adopting a stepwise selection approach. ORs and their 95% CIs were estimated from logistic regression analysis. P values less than 0.05 (2-tailed) were considered significant.\nDisclosure\nAll the authors declared no competing interests.\nReferences\nManagement of patients on dialysis and with kidney transplantation during the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic in Brescia, Italy\nCOVID-19 and the inpatient dialysis unit: managing resources during contingency planning pre-crisis\nClinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China\nA single center observational study of the clinical characteristics and short-term outcome of 20 kidney transplant patients admitted for SARS-CoV2 pneumonia\nCOVID-19 infection in kidney transplant recipients\nCharacteristics of and important lessons from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in China: summary of a report of 72314 cases from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention\nClinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome: the Berlin Definition\n2013 ACCF/AHA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines\nEpidemiology of Covid-19 in a long-term care facility in King County, Washington\n","References depth 1":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Management of patients on dialysis and with kidney transplantation during the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic in Brescia, Italy","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Emergency Response Epidemiology Team.

The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.\n\n Increasing quartile of NLR was statistically significantly associated with secondary outcome.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR is associated with outcomes in unselected critically ill patients.\n\n In patients with sepsis, there was no statistically significant relationship between NLR and mortality.\n\n Further investigation is required to increase understanding of the pathophysiology of this relationship and to validate these findings with data collected prospectively.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article

a major threat to public health1–3.\n Despite intense research efforts, how, when and where new diseases appear are still a source of considerable uncertainty.\n A severe respiratory disease was recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China5.\n This outbreak highlights the ongoing ability of viral spill-over from animals to cause

The most common comorbidities identified were obesity (48%), arterial hypertension (44%) and chronic lung disease (37%). All patients were admitted by hypoxemic respiratory failure and none received non-invasive mechanical ventilation. Forty-five (94%) underwent intubation, 3 (6%) high flow nasal therapy (HFNT), 1 (2%) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and 22 (46%) required prone position.

Procalcitonin plasma above 0.5 mug/L was associated with 16% vs. 19% (p = 0.78) risk of death after 7 days.\nConclusion\nThis early experience with SARS-CoV-2 in Spain suggests that a strategy of right oxygenation avoiding non-invasive mechanical ventilation was life-saving. Seven-day mortality in SARS-CoV-2 requiring intubation was lower than 15%, with 80% of patients still requiring mechanical ventilation. After 15 days of ICU admission, half of patients remained intubated, whereas one third died.\nIntroduction\nPercentages of ICU beds occupied on March 18th, 2020 in Spain.\nSince the initial identification of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Wuhan, it has been important to identify characteristics beyond China with implications in management. Reports describing intensive care unit (ICU) patients with SARS-CoV-2 out of China are still limited. The clinical course of adult inpatients in Wuhan has been reported with a high mortality rate and a risk of death above 90% in presence of high (0.05 mug/L) procalcitonin (PCT) plasma. Because most patients in China and Italy received non-invasive ventilation (NIV), information is needed on patients following a strategy of early intubation without inducing potential ventilator-induced lung injury. Moreover, in view of the limitation of resources, it is also important to improve insight on 7-day mortality and identify different phenotypes for personalised management. In Vitoria (capital of Alava), a city in the Basque Country that experienced the acceleration curve before other Spanish provinces (in relation to a massive contagion in a funeral) with 216% ICU capacity being already effective on March 18th, 2020 (see comparison with Madrid (89%), Barcelona (17%) and other provinces in Fig. 1 ), anticipating the effect in other regions.\nThis present study aimed at reporting the epidemiology of the first patients admitted with SARS-CoV-2 in Spanish ICUs, twenty days after the first admission in a hospital located at ground zero (Fig. 1) in Spain. Secondary objectives were: to compare with the first ICU admissions during the 2009 influenza pandemic in Spain and the first reported series of ICU patients with SARS-Cov-2 in Wuhan and USA. Because of mortality reports in Wuhan suggesting a close association, we assessed correlation between PCT plasma at ICU admission and 7-day mortality.\nMethods\nStudy design\nAll consecutive SARS-CoV-2 adult patients (&gt;= 18 years old) from the University Hospital Araba (Vitoria, Spain) between March 4th, 2020 and March 31th, 2020 were included. All patients that required hospitalisation with a COVID-19 diagnosis according to WHO interim guidance were included. Patients were followed until ICU discharge or death from March 4th, 2020 (first patient admission) to March 31th, 2020. All clinical data were collected prospectively by the investigators. PCT plasma levels samples were obtained within 24 ICU admissions.\nNon-invasive ventilation was not indicated in this cohort. Intubation was clinically indicated in presence of respiratory alkalosis with progressive hyperventilation when delivering high oxygen concentrations.\nData collection\nBasic epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, microbiology, treatment, and outcome data were extracted (HB) and standardised in a CRF, modified from the ISARIC CRF. The study protocol was approved by the IRB and informed consent was waived (ref. 2020-022). Patient data were censored at 15 days of follow up, on April 6th, 2020 and survival data were estimated at 7-day and 15-day after ICU admission.\nLaboratory procedures\nClinical specimens for SARS-CoV-2 identification were obtained in accordance with Centres of Disease Control guidelines. Methods for laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were performed at the hospital laboratory.\nDefinitions\nA confirmed case was defined by a positive result on a reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay of a nasopharyngeal swab or respiratory specimen. Comorbidities were identified from hospital charts. Definitions used in this article have been reported elsewhere.\nBiomarkers measurement\nProcalcitonin plasma levels were determined with the Assay Alinity I  , Abbott, EEUU. The assay has a detection limit of 0.02 mug/L with a probability of 95%, sensitivity of 0.06 mug/L (upper-reference-range 0.5 mug/L in healthy subjects). Determination of PCT plasma levels was performed within 24 hours after ICU admission.\nStatistical analysis\nConsidering the rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, the aim of the study was to report a fast overview of the situation in one of the first cities to be impacted by the outbreak. Therefore, no sample size was calculated.\nContinuous variables were described as medianswith interquartile range (IQR) or mean with standard deviation (SD), and categorical variables were presented as counts and percentages. Pairwise comparisons for categorical variables were performed by using the Pearson's chi2 test. Comparisons between continuous variables used Student's t-test and Mann-Whitney test according to their distribution. Statistical significance was considered if the P-value was less than 0.05. Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS Statistics version 25.0 software (IBM).\nAssociation between survival and PCT plasma levels was estimated using Kaplan-Meier curves. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were computed using the long rank test. Statistical significance was considered if the P-value was less than 0.01. Statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad prism 6 software.\nResults\nBaseline characteristics of the population with confirmed SARS-CoV-2, compared with series in Seattle (Arentz et al.), Wuhan (Yang et al.) and pandemic 2009 influenza in Spain (Rello et al.).\nTable 1	 	\nStudy	Current study Spain	Arentz et al., 2020 USA 	Yang et al., 2020 China 	Rello et al., 2009 Spain 	 	Illness	SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia	SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia	SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia	Influenza A (H1N1)	 	Total patients with confirmed illness	48	21	52	32	 	Age, mean (SD or range)	63 (12)	70 (43-92)	60 (13)	40 (14)	 	Sex					 	 Male	27 (56%)	11 (52%)	35 (67%)	21 (66%)	 	 Female	21 (44%)	10 (48%)	17 (33%)	11 (34%)	 	Days from onset symptoms to ICU admission, median (IQR)	7 (5-12)	-	10 (7-13)	3 (2-6)	 	APACHE II score, mean (SD)	15 (5)	-	17 (1)	14 (6)	 	SOFA score, mean (SD)	7 (3)	-	-	7 (3)	 	Signs and symptomsa					 	 Fever	48 (100%)	11 (52%)	51 (98%)	706 (96%)	 	 Cough	35 (74%)	11 (48%)	40 (77%)	647 (88%)	 	 Dyspnoea	42 (88%)	-	33 (63%)	-	 	 Malaise	21 (44%)	-	18 (35%)	221 (30%)	 	 Myalgia	2 (4%)	-	6 (12%)	508 (69%)	 	 Headache	-	-	3 (6%)	434 (59%)	 	 Rhinorrhea	-	-	3 (6%)	-	 	 Vomiting	-	-	2 (4%)	-	 	 Arthralgia	-	-	1 (2%)	-	 	 Chest pain	-	-	1 (2%)	-	 	 Sore throat	-	-	-	427 (58%)	 	 Sudden onset symptoms	-	-	-	338 (46%)	 	 Shortness of breath	-	17 (76%)	-	-	 	Treatment					 	 Antibacterial agents	42 (88%)	-	49 (94%)	32 (100%)	 	  beta-lactams plus fluoroquinolones	-	-	-	20 (63%)	 	  beta-lactams plus macrolides	-	-	-	6 (19%)	 	  beta-lactams plus linezolid	-	-	-	5 (16%)	 	  levofloxacin	17 (35%)	-	-	1 (3%)	 	  ceftriaxone	22 (46%)	-	-	-	 	  azithromycin	10 (21%)	-	-	-	 	  linezolid	9 (19%)	-	-	-	 	  other beta-lactams	15 (31%)	-	-	-	 	 Antiviral agents	45 (94%)	-	23 (44%)	21 (66%)	 	  Oseltamivir standard dose (75 mg bid)	-	-	18 (35%)	32 (100%)	 	  Oseltamivir high dose (150 mg bid)	-	-	-	10 (31%)	 	  Ganciclovir	-	-	14 (27%)	-	 	  Lopinavir	-	-	7 (14%)	-	 	  Kaletra	45 (94%)	-	-	-	 	 Others		-			 	  Steroids	17 (35%)	-	30 (58%)	11 (34%)	 	  Immunoglobulin	-	-	28 (54%)	-	 	  Tocilizumab	2 (4%)	-	-	-	 	  Chloroquine	45 (94%)	-	-	-	 	  Interferon	41 (85%)		-	-	 	  Vasoconstrictor agents	-	14 (67%)	18 (35%)	20 (63%)	 	  Renal replacement therapy	-	-	9 (17%)	7 (22%)	 	  Prone position ventilation	-	8 (50%)	6 (12%)	8 (33%)	 	 MV	45 (94%)	15 (71%)	37 (71%)	24 (75%)	 	  Invasive	-	-	22 (42%)	16 (67%)	 	  Non-invasive	-	-	29 (56%)	8 (33%)	 	  HFNC	-	-	33 (64%)	-	 	  ECMO	1 (2%)	-	6 (12%)	-	 	 Comorbidities/Complications					 	  Obesity	23 (48%)	-	-	10 (31%)	 	  BMI 30 to 40	15 (31%)	-	-	6 (19%)	 	  BMI &gt;

No patients were admitted from a nursing home. Patient characteristics are shown in Table 1 . Obesity (48%), arterial hypertension (44%) and chronic lung disease (38%) were the three most associated comorbidities, whereas diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism and history of tobacco use were reported in 19% of admissions.\nThe median time to onset of symptoms prior to ICU admission was 7 days [5-12 days] (Table 1). The most common symptoms at ICU admission were fever (100%), dyspnoea (88%), cough (73%) and malaise (44%). Myalgias (4%) were very uncommon. Ninety-four percent of patients received antiviral treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine, plus interferon beta (85%). Empirical antibiotic agents were administrated to 42 patients, whereas super-infection was identified in 6 patients.\nFlowchart of detailing outcomes at day-7 post ICU admission.\nOutcomes for individual patients included in the manuscript (assessed April 6th, 2020).\nAll patients were admitted with hypoxemic respiratory failure and none received non-invasive mechanical ventilation. Forty-five (94%) underwent intubation and 3 (6%) high-flow oxygen nasal therapy (HFNT). Tracheostomy was performed in five (11%) ventilated patients. Prone position was performed in 22 patients (49% of mechanically ventilated patients) and none received inhaled nitric oxide or prostacyclin. One patient was transferred to a referral centre for veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy. One myocarditis was documented. A flow chart (Fig. 2 ) is detailing outcomes on day-7 post intubation.

PCT plasma levels details with different breakpoints are showed in Table 2 . PCT plasma levels above 0.5 mug/L were 16%vs.19.0% (p  &gt; 0.20) for survivors and non-survivors, respectively. PCT plasma levels details are showed in Fig. 4 and 5. No significant differences were identified, using a breakpoint of 1 mug/L (Table 2 and Fig. 4, Fig. 5 ). A Kaplan-Meier survival curve (Fig. 6 ) is detailing overall survival rates and correlations with initial PCT plasma (P-value = 0.22).\nDiscussion\nThis study describes 48 critically ill patients with COVID-19 and severe acute respiratory failure in Vitoria, Spain, from March 4th, 2020 to March 31th, 2020. Patients received HFNT or intubation, but non-invasive mechanical ventilation was not applied. Two weeks after ICU admission, three out of ten intubated patients have died, and half of the patient cohort required prolonged ventilatory support. Two out of ten intubated patients were extubated (and discharged), most at the second week of ventilation. PCT plasma levels (threshold 0.5 mug/L) failed to predict mortality. Our findings suggest that an oxygenation strategy emphasising optimisation of oxygenation, intubation based on clinical criteria of hyperventilation and avoiding ventilator-induced lung injury associated with non-invasive mechanical ventilation would be life-saving in a significant proportion of patients.\n Table 1 compares current findings with first series of SARS-CoV2 in the ICU in China, USA, and 2009 pandemic influenza in Spain. Clinical presentation is consistent with a recent systematic review, lymphocytopenia and coagulation alterations being common at hospital admission, with some important differences documented when compared with pandemic influenza in 2009 (Table 1), as reported elsewhere, and also with the first ICU series reported from Wuhan. Obesity was the most common comorbidity in our report, suggesting differences in western countries regarding Wuhan reports (11), followed by hypertension and chronic respiratory diseases. The low prevalence of immunocompromised (solid organ transplants or HIV) and pregnant women compared with severe influenza-infected patients may be associated with the interaction of coronavirus with innate immunity. Fei Zhou et al. reported a risk of death above 90% in patients with high procalcitonin, which is not consistent with our findings. This can be due to different laboratory techniques, super-infection rates or degree of acute lung injury (no NIV was applied in our cohort). Although more information on PCT is required, our findings suggest that no prognostic information can be inferred. The earliest extubation occurred three days after initiation of mechanical ventilation, but nine subsequent patients were extubated within the next week (Fig. 3). These figures may be different depending of SARS-CoV-2 phenotype, prior strategy of oxygenation (HFNT, continous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or NIV), and strategies of management post-ventilation (levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), use of inhaled nitric oxide, etc). Further research is required to identify how to improve management. Most patients were admitted to the ICU after a few days of fever above 38.5  C, arriving at the emergency department (ED) severely dehydrated and hyperventilating. Hypovolaemia leads to increased dead space and pulmonary hypoperfusion, needing to be corrected. High PEEP and furosemide may lead to unnecessary requirement of vasopressors and induce acute kidney injury, and thus in need of continuous veno-venous haemofiltration program (CVVHF).\nThis early report of characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 influenza in Spain is of interest, as most information currently available is coming from large cohorts in China, or short case series from Italy or USA. An important characteristic is that in the current cohort, no patients were exposed to prior NIV, which was commonly performed using a facial mask in Wuhan or a helmet in Italy, with a protocol of earlier intubation based on hyperventilation unable to maintain SatvO2 above 90%. Patients in this cohort were intubated a median of 7 days after onset, which is later than in pandemic influenza but earlier than in Wuhan. Zhou et al. reported 97% mortality in intubated patients during a median time (IQR) of 18.5 (15 to 19) days. Seven-day mortality was estimated to be lower than 15% in our cohort and 10 patients were extubated within the second week, which means that the prognosis is better with different strategies of oxygenation. In contrast with reports from China or Seattle suggesting a severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a strategy of early intubation disclosed that SARS-CoV-2 does not lead to a typical ARDS. In our experience, two thirds of our patients have initial lung compliance &gt;= 40 ml/cm H20 post intubation being consistent with a preliminary report with 16 patients by Gattinoni et al., suggesting that ARDS is a consequence of acute lung injury associated with delayed intubation or super-infection. Thus, NIV seems not recommended and early high PEEP (above 10 cm H20 is probably not the right ventilatory strategy) may be harmful. Our experience suggests avoiding spontaneous ventilation early in the ED or ward may be harmful. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 patients can be maintained with high-flow oxygen nasal therapy (HFNT) or high-concentration oxygen reservoir if they do not present extreme hyperventilation. Early on this disease, non-intubated patients may benefit from prone position before intubation. Three of our patients were managed like this without intubation and were discharged early. Recruitment manoeuvres should be contraindicated and the benefit of prone position in intubated patients and protective ventilation should be restricted to those developing acute lung injury. These findings suggest that hypoxemic vasoconstriction is the main early mechanism and patients can benefit of inhaled prostacyclin or nitric oxide (before developing tachyphylaxis).\nLastly, although we did not document pulmonary embolisms in our cohort (autopsies were not allowed), laboratory tests are consistent with endothelial injury and micro-thrombosis. Zhou et al. reported serum ferritin with a median above 1400 ng/L among 54 non-survivors in a context of hyperinflammatory states. These patients should receive sCD25 measurements and a bone marrow aspirate to rule out systemic haemophagocytic lymphocytosis, which should be treated with 500 mg/kg gamma globulins/day and dexamethasone 10 mg/12 h for 4 days. The same authors also reported D-dimer above 1 ug/ml among 81% of non-survivors and our findings are consistent with these observations. Although no difference on overall 28-day mortality was found between heparin users and non-users (30.3% vs. 29.7%, p  = 0.91) in a report among 449 patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection in China, the 28-day mortality was significantly reduced in those receiving low molecular weight heparin with a D-dimer &gt; 6 fold the upper limit of normal (32% vs. 52%, P  = 0.01) or a Sepsis-Induced Coagulopathy (SIC) score   &gt;= 4 (40% vs. 64%, P  = 0.02).\nOur study has several limitations. More than half of the cohort remained in the ICU at the time of censoring on April 6th, 2020 and further outcomes assessment have to be performed. Our sample size is small, because we focused on critically ill, and data cannot be extrapolated to patients hospitalised in medical wards. However, it is an early report illustrative of the epidemiology in South Europe, which can be compared with Wuhan and initial reports of pandemic influenza A H1N1pdm 2009 in Spain (Table 1). We already expanded the ICU capacity above two-fold in March 18thand data cannot be generalisable to patients with another acceleration phase or with different available resources, but may serve to develop contingency plans in other geographical regions. Procalcitonin technique of determination may influence values and data may not be comparable when using other methods, such as KRIPTOR  to determine plasma values. Similarly, the strategy of early intubation, without prior NIV trial would means that data cannot be extrapolated to sites with other management strategies. Lastly, pulmonary compliance and driving pressure was not recorded in the study protocol, limiting identification of phenotypes and extrapolation to other sites.\nConclusion\nThis early experience with SARS-CoV-2 in Spain suggests that the right oxygenation is life-saving. Seven-day mortality in SARS-CoV-2 requiring intubation was lower than 15%, with 80% of patients still requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation. PCT plasma levels do not predict survival. After 15 days of ICU admission, half of patients remained intubated, whereas one third were non-survivors. Our clinical observations provide useful insights that can help to improve management and outcomes.\nDisclosure of interest\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interest.\nFunding\nThis work was funded in part by .\nCompliance with ethical standards\nThe study was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of Araba Hospital (2020-0022) and consent was waived due to the observational nature of the study.\nConsent for publication\nNot applicable.\nAvailability of data and materials\nThe datasets generated and/or analysed during the current study are not publicly available due to privacy (patients' data) but are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.\nAuthors' contributions\nThe study was designed by JR.

efficacy of AHR using ethanol-based disinfectant against mucus is greatly reduced until infectious mucus adhering to the hands/fingers has completely dried.\n If there is insufficient time before treating the next patient (i.\ne.\n, if the infectious mucus is not completely dry), medical staff should be aware that effectiveness of AHR is reduced.\n Since AHW is effective against both dry and

were compared to patients who were managed only with invasive mechanical ventilation (invasive MV).\n\n\nResults\nOf 302 MERS critically ill patients, NIV was used initially in 105 (35%) patients, whereas 197 (65%) patients were only managed with invasive MV.\n\n Patients who were managed with NIV initially had lower baseline SOFA score and less extensive infiltrates on chest radiograph compared with patients managed with invasive MV.\n\n The vast majority (92.4%) of patients who were managed initially with NIV required intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation, and were more likely to require inhaled nitric oxide compared to those who were managed initially with invasive MV.\n\n ICU and hospital length of stay were similar between NIV patients and invasive MV

Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.\n\n\nFindings\n191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital.\n\n 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients).\n\n Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·03–1·17, per year increase; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·61–12·23; p&lt;0·0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL (18·42, 2·64–128·55; p=0·0033) on admission.\n\n Median duration of viral shedding was 20·0 days (IQR 17·0–24·0) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors.\n\n The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage.\n\n Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.\n\n\nFunding\nChinese Academy of Medical Sciences Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences; National Science Grant for Distinguished Young Scholars; National Key Research and Development Program of China; The Beijing Science and Technology Project; and Major Projects of National Science and Technology on New Drug Creation and Development.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7270627","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Fei","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ronghui","surname":"Du","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guohui","surname":"Fan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhibo","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jie","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yeming","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoying","surname":"Gu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lulu","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xudong","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiuyang","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shengjin","surname":"Tu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hua","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Cao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"10.1001/jama.2020.1097","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The novel coronavirus originating in Wuhan, China: challenges for global health governance","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1101/2020.02.07.937862","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus: the species and its viruses:a statement of the Coronavirus Study Group","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Short term outcome and risk factors for adverse clinical outcomes in adults with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2001316","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Early Transmission Dynamics in Wuhan, China, of Novel Coronavirus–Infected Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nThe initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020.

SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

The median age was 36 years (IQR = 31 - 52).\n\n Ten (31.2%) were obese, 2 (6.3%) pregnant and 16 (50%) had pre-existing medical complications.\n\n Twenty-nine (90.6%) had primary viral pneumonitis, 2 (6.3%) exacerbation of structural respiratory disease and 1 (3.1%) secondary bacterial pneumonia.\n\n Twenty-four patients (75.0%) developed multiorgan dysfunction, 7 (21.9%) received renal replacement techniques and 24 (75.0%) required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Six patients died within 28 days, with two additional late deaths.\n\n Oseltamivir administration delay ranged from 2 to 8 days after illness onset, 31.2% received high-dose (300 mg/day), and treatment duration ranged from 5 to 10 days (mean 8.0 ± 3.3).\n\n\nConclusions\nOver a 5-week period, influenza A (H1N1)v infection led to ICU admission in 32 adult patients, with frequently observed severe hypoxemia and a relatively high case-fatality rate.\n\n Clinicians should be aware of pulmonary complications of influenza A (H1N1)v infection, particularly in pregnant and young obese but previously healthy persons.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2784367","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Jordi","surname":"Rello","email":"jrello.hj23.ics@gencat.cat","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Alejandro","surname":"Rodríguez","email":"ahr1161@yahoo.es","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Pedro","surname":"Ibañez","email":"pibanez@hsll.es","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Lorenzo","surname":"Socias","email":"lsocias@hsll.es","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Javier","surname":"Cebrian","email":"jcebriand@gmail.com","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Asunción","surname":"Marques","email":"amarques@hospital-ribera.com","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"José","surname":"Guerrero","email":"jeguerrerosanz@gmail.com","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Sergio","surname":"Ruiz-Santana","email":"sruisan@gobiernodecanarias.org","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Enrique","surname":"Marquez","email":"marquezflores@telefonica.ne","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Frutos","surname":"Del Nogal-Saez","email":"frunogal@terra.es","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Francisco","surname":"Alvarez-Lerma","email":"Falvarez@imas.imim.es","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Sergio","surname":"Martínez","email":"s1m2c3@hotmail.com","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Miquel","surname":"Ferrer","email":"MIFERRER@clinic.ub.es","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Manuel","surname":"Avellanas","email":"mlavellanas@ono.com","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Rosa","surname":"Granada","email":"29380rgv@comb.cat","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Enrique","surname":"Maraví-Poma","email":"enrique.maravi.poma@cfnavarra.es","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Patricia","surname":"Albert","email":"patricia.albert@salud.madrid.org","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Rafael","surname":"Sierra","email":"rafael.sierra.sspa@juntadeandalucia.es","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Loreto","surname":"Vidaur","email":"loreto.vidaurtello@osakidetza.net","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Patricia","surname":"Ortiz","email":"portiz.girona.ics@gencat.cat","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Isidro","surname":"Prieto del Portillo","email":"iprieto.hrc@salud.madrid.org","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Beatriz","surname":"Galván","email":"bgalvanguijo@terra.es","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Cristóbal","surname":"León-Gil","email":"cleong@telefonica.net","contributions":"2"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Pandemic (H1N1) 2009.

creating much confusion and making comparisons difficult.\n\n Similarly, strong debate exists on the validity and clinical relevance of animal models of ARF; on choices of fluid management and of end-points for trials of new interventions in this field; and on how information technology can be used to assist this process.\n\n Accordingly, we sought to review the available evidence, make recommendations and delineate key questions for future studies.\n\n\nMethods\nWe undertook a systematic review of the literature using Medline and PubMed searches.\n\n We determined a list of key questions and convened a 2-day consensus conference to develop summary statements via a series of alternating breakout and plenary sessions.\n\n In these sessions, we identified supporting evidence and generated recommendations and/or directions for future research.\n\n\nResults\nWe found sufficient consensus on 47 questions to allow the development of recommendations.\n\n Importantly, we were able to develop a consensus definition for ARF.\n\n In some cases it was also possible to issue useful consensus recommendations for future investigations.\n\n We present a summary of the findings.\n\n (Full versions of the six workgroups' findings are available on the internet at )\nConclusion\nDespite limited data, broad areas of consensus exist for the physiological and clinical principles needed to guide the development of consensus recommendations for defining ARF, selection of animal models, methods of monitoring fluid therapy, choice of physiological and clinical end-points for trials, and the possible role of information technology.\n\n\n","id":"PMC522841","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

systematic review and meta-analysis","abstract":"Introduction\nAn epidemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) began in December 2019 in China leading to a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC).\n\n Clinical, laboratory, and imaging features have been partially characterized in some observational studies.\n\n No systematic reviews on COVID-19 have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed a systematic literature review with meta-analysis, using three databases to assess clinical, laboratory, imaging features, and outcomes of COVID-19 confirmed cases.\n\n Observational studies and also case reports, were included, and analyzed separately.\n\n We performed a random-effects model meta-analysis to calculate pooled prevalences and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI).\n\n\nResults\n660 articles were retrieved for the time frame (1/1/2020-2/23/2020).\n\n After screening, 27 articles were selected for full-text assessment, 19 being finally included for qualitative and quantitative analyses.\n\n Additionally, 39 case report articles were included and analyzed separately.\n\n For 656 patients, fever (88.7%, 95%CI 84.5–92.9%), cough (57.6%, 95%CI 40.8–74.4%) and dyspnea (45.6%, 95%CI 10.9–80.4%) were the most prevalent manifestations.\n\n Among the patients, 20.3% (95%CI 10.0–30.6%) required intensive care unit (ICU), 32.8% presented with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (95%CI 13.7–51.8), 6.2% (95%CI 3.1–9.3) with shock.\n\n Some 13.9% (95%CI 6.2–21.5%) of hospitalized patients had fatal outcomes (case fatality rate, CFR).\n\n\nConclusion\nCOVID-19 brings a huge burden to healthcare facilities, especially in patients with comorbidities.\n\n ICU was required for approximately 20% of polymorbid, COVID-19 infected patients and hospitalization was associated with a CFR of &gt;13%.\n\n As this virus spreads globally, countries need to urgently prepare human resources, infrastructure and facilities to treat severe COVID-19.\n","id":"PMC7102608","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Alfonso

retrospective, observational study","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

An understanding of the risk factors and clinical outcomes of hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may provide guidance for management.\nMethods\nAll laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases in adults admitted to an academic medical center in Seattle, Washington, between 2 March and 26 March 2020 were included. We evaluated individuals with and without severe disease, defined as admission to the intensive care unit or death.\nResults\nOne hundred five COVID-19 patients were hospitalized. Thirty-five percent were admitted from a senior home or skilled nursing facility. The median age was 69 years, and half were women. Three or more comorbidities were present in 55% of patients, with hypertension (59%), obesity (47%), cardiovascular disease (38%), and diabetes (33%) being the most prevalent. Most (63%) had symptoms for &gt;=5 days prior to admission. Only 39% had fever in the first 24 hours, whereas 41% had hypoxia at admission. Seventy-three percent of patients had lymphopenia. Of 50 samples available for additional testing, no viral coinfections were identified. Severe disease occurred in 49%. Eighteen percent of patients were placed on mechanical ventilation, and the overall mortality rate was 33%.\nConclusions\nDuring the early days of the COVID-19 epidemic in Washington State, the disease had its greatest impact on elderly patients with medical comorbidities. We observed high rates of severe disease and mortality in our hospitalized patients.\nIn this case series of 105 consecutively hospitalized COVID-19 patients, the median age was 69 years, and 55% had 3 or more comorbidities. Severe disease occurred in 49% of patients, and overall mortality was 33%.\nInfections with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) first occurred in late 2019 in Hubei Province, China, and has since disseminated worldwide. The first confirmed case in the United States was a returning traveler from Wuhan, China, who presented to medical attention on 19 January 2020, in Snohomish County, Washington. In February, a cluster of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases was identified at a nursing home in Kirkland, Washington, resulting in the first reported death in the United States on 29 February. Since that time, the disease has occurred widely in the greater Seattle area, and cases have been reported in all 50 states.\nThe epidemiology and clinical features of hospitalized COVID-19 patients have been described in China, South Korea, and Singapore. The prominent clinical manifestations have included fever, cough, dyspnea, fatigue, myalgia, and radiographic evidence of pneumonia. Shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute cardiac injury, acute kidney injury (AKI), and deaths were reported in severe cases. Early reports indicated that the infection occurs in clusters within groups in close contact, and that severe disease was more common in the elderly, men, and those with comorbidities. The epidemiologic and clinical features of COVID-19 disease in the United States are beginning to be elucidated, specifically in critically ill patients. Additional information is needed to help clinicians understand the characteristics of this disease. In this case series, we examine the epidemiology, clinical features, and outcomes of 105 hospitalized patients from 3 university-affiliated hospitals in Seattle, Washington. The characteristics associated with severe versus nonsevere clinical courses are described.\nMETHODS\nStudy Design and Participants\nWe conducted a retrospective chart review examining the clinical characteristics of adult patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients were included if they were admitted to 1 of 3 University of Washington (UW) affiliated hospitals in Seattle between 2 March and 26 March 2020.\nThe hospitals included UW Medical Center (composed of 2 campuses: Montlake, a 570-bed tertiary/quaternary care facility and Northwest, a 281-bed community-based care facility), and Harborview Medical Center (HMC), a 413-bed level 1 trauma center.\nData Sources and Collection\nDemographic data, encounter dates, and laboratory measurements were extracted electronically from the UW clinical data warehouse for confirmed cases. The medications, vital signs, radiology studies, and clinical events were reviewed by physicians in the Division of Infectious Diseases and entered into a standardized data collection instrument using REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture).\nStudy Outcomes\nThe primary outcome was severe COVID-19, defined as a composite endpoint of admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) or death. Each death was reviewed by 2 physicians independently to determine whether it was related to COVID-19. Secondary outcomes included shock and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which were also adjudicated by 2 physicians independently. These outcomes were evaluated until 8 May 2020, 43 days from the date the last patient was admitted.\nStudy Definitions\nFever was defined as a recorded temperature of 38.0 C or higher. Hypoxia was defined as an oxygen saturation &lt;90% on ambient air, or requirement of supplemental O2. AKI was defined as an increase in creatinine of 0.3 mg/dL from baseline, or 1.5 times the patient's baseline creatinine. Leukopenia was defined as white blood cell count &lt;4 x 109/L, and lymphopenia was defined as a lymphocyte count &lt;1.5 x 109/L. Cardiac injury was defined as a maximum troponin value of 0.1 ng/mL or higher during hospitalization. Patients were denoted as having ARDS if the physician indicated this in their clinical notes or, in the absence of this documentation, if the patient had new respiratory failure, bilateral lung opacities on chest imaging, and a PaO2:FIO2 ratio &lt;= 300. Shock was defined as hypotension requiring vasopressors. Patients were considered to have received antibiotics during their admission if these were given for more than 48 hours. Patients were considered to have received corticosteroids during their admission if they were newly started on systemic corticosteroids.\nLaboratory Testing\nNasopharyngeal samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) developed by the University of Washington Virology laboratory. Indeterminate results were confirmed at the Washington State Department of Health (WA DOH) laboratory or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). If a patient had an indeterminate result from the UW Virology Lab and a positive result from the WA DOH or CDC laboratory, this subject was considered positive. If available, residual clinical samples were subsequently tested by quantitative real-time RT-PCR for 12 additional respiratory viruses, including influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza viruses 1-4, rhinovirus, bocavirus, and seasonal coronaviruses. Semiquantitative viral load was defined as the cycle threshold (Ct) of the initial sample tested.\nStatistical Analysis\nContinuous variables were displayed as median values with simple or interquartile ranges as appropriate. Categorical variables were summarized as counts of all patients or a subset of evaluated patients with percentages. All analyses were conducted using Stata 14.2 (StataCorp).\nStudy Oversight\nThis study was approved by the University of Washington Institutional Review Board (STUDY00006181). Informed consent was waived for retrospective review of patient charts.\nRESULTS\nOne hundred five patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were hospitalized between 2 March and 26 March 2020, with a median follow-up of 9 days (range, 1-53). The demographic and clinical characteristics are shown in Table 1. The median age was 69 (range, 23-97), half were women, and 71% were white. Thirty-five percent of patients lived in a skilled nursing facility or senior living. Most patients (93%) had at least 1 comorbidity; 55% had 3 or more chronic medical problems. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (59%), obesity (47%), cardiovascular disease (38%), and diabetes (33%).\nDemographics and Baseline Characteristics of Patients Infected With SARS-CoV2\n	All Patients (N = 105)	Not Severe (n = 54)	Severe (n = 51)	 	Age, years	69 (23-97)	67 (25-96)	70 (23-97)	 	 &gt;60 years	70 (67)	38 (70)	32 (63)	 	Sex				 	 Male	53 (50)	23 (43)	30 (59)	 	 Female	52 (50)	31 (57)	21 (41)	 	Race				 	 White	75 (71)	41 (76)	34 (67)	 	 Black	6 (6)	4 (7)	2 (4)	 	 Asian/Pacific Islander	18 (17)	7 (13)	11 (21)	 	 Unknown or other	6 (6)	2 (4)	4 (8)	 	Hispanic ethnicity	18 (17)	10 (19)	8 (16)	 	Smoking (ever)	22/86 (26)	12/45 (27)	10/41 (24)	 	Alcohol (any)	26/87 (30)	14/45 (31)	12/42 (29)	 	Comorbidity				 	 Hypertension	62 (59)	32 (59)	30 (59)	 	 Obesity, BMI &gt;30 kg/m2	44/93 (47)	21/50 (42)	23/43 (53)	 	 Cardiovasculara disease	40 (38)	22 (42)	18 (35)	 	 Diabetes	35 (33)	17 (31)	18 (35)	 	 Chronic kidney disease	27 (26)	12 (22)	15 (29)	 	 Heart failure	20 (19)	13 (24)	7 (14)	 	 Cancer	16 (15)	5 (9)	11 (22)	 	 Asthma	10 (10)	7 (13)	3 (6)	 	 Obstructive sleep apnea	12 (11)	5 (9)	7 (14)	 	 COPD	11 (10)	4 (7)	7 (14)	 	 Autoimmune disease	9 (9)	5 (10)	4 (8)	 	 Transplant (solid organ)	4 (4)	3 (6)	1 (2)	 	 HIV infection	1 (1)	0	1 (2)	 	 Pregnancy	2 (2)	2 (4)	0	 	Comorbidity burden				 	 None	7 (7)	3 (5)	4 (8)	 	 1-2	40 (38)	23 (43)	17 (33)	 	 3 or more	58 (55)	28 (52)	30 (59)	 	Residence				 	 Homeless	1 (1)	1 (2)	0	 	 Senior living	10 (10)	7 (13)	3 (6)	 	 Skilled nursing facility	26 (25)	10 (19)	16 (31)	 	 Home	67 (64)	35 (66)	32 (63)	 	Epidemiologic risk factor				 	 None	50 (48)	27 (50)	23 (45)	 	 Travel	2 (2)	0	2 (4)	 	 Known contact	17 (16)	10 (19)	7 (16)	 	 Nursing/care facility	35 (33)	17 (31)	18 (35)	 	\nAbbreviations: BMI, body mass index; COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus.\n\naIncludes cerebrovascular disease.

Blood laboratories at admission showed leukopenia in 15% and lymphopenia in 73% of patients (Table 3).\nClinical Signs and Symptoms on Presentation\n	All Patients (N = 105)	Not Severe (n = 54)	Severe (n = 51)	 	Vitals				 	 First temperature	36.9 (35.3-39.8)	36.8 (36.1-39.3)	37 (35.3-39.8)	 	 T &gt;38.0 C x 1st 24 hours	37 (39)	13 (25)	24 (55)	 	 Heart rate &gt;100 bpm	39 (37)	19 (35)	20 (39)	 	 Systolic pressure, mmHg	129 (70-188)	130 (93-188)	125 (70-173)	 	 Respiratory rate	20 (14-48)	19 (14-32)	22 (14-48)	 	 Hypoxiaa	43 (41)	10 (19)	33 (65)	 	Symptoms				 	 Symptoms x &gt;5 days	54/86 (63)	31/43 (72)	23/43 (53)	 	 Cough	76 (72)	41 (76)	35 (69)	 	 Dyspnea	56 (53)	24 (44)	32 (63)	 	 Fatigue	51 (49)	29 (54)	22 (43)	 	 Fever/chills	49 (47)	25 (46)	24 (47)	 	 Anorexia	33 (31)	18 (33)	15 (29)	 	 Sputum production	19 (18)	8 (15)	11 (22)	 	 Diarrhea	24 (23)	12 (22)	12 (24)	 	 Myalgia/arthralgia	25 (24)	15 (28)	10 (20)	 	 Nausea/vomiting	23 (22)	14 (26)	9 (18)	 	 Chest pain	15 (14)	9 (17)	6 (12)	 	 Congestion/rhinorrhea	15 (14)	9 (17)	6 (12)	 	 Headache	8 (8)	4 (7)	4 (8)	 	 Sore throat	7 (7)	5 (9)	2 (4)	 	Imaging				 	 Abnormal CXR	78/91 (86)	36/45 (80)	42/46 (91)	 	 Abnormal chest CT	18/19 (95)	7/8 (88)	11/11 (100)	 	\nValues are noted as median (range), n of all patients (%) or a proportion of subset, n/N (%).\nAbbreviations: CT, computed tomography; CXR, chest x-ray.\n\naDefined as O2 saturation of &lt;90% on ambient air or requiring supplemental O2.\nLaboratory Measurements on Presentation\n	All patients (n = 105)	Not Severe (n = 54)	Severe (n = 51)	 	White blood cell count, x 109/L	6.4 (4.6-8.8)	5.3 (4.3-7.3)	7.3 (5.8-13.3)	 	 &lt;4	15 (15)	10 (18)	5 (10)	 	 4-10	68 (66)	41 (76)	27 (55)	 	 &gt;=10	20 (19)	3 (6)	17 (35)	 	Lymphocyte count, x 109/L	1.1 (0.6-1.5)	1.2 (0.8-1.6)	0.9 (0.5-1.4)	 	 &lt;1.5	74 (73)	36 (69)	38 (78)	 	Neutrophil count, x 109/L	4.3 (3.0-6.3)	3.8 (2.8-5.1)	5.4 (3.3-8.4)	 	Hemoglobin, g/dL	12 (10.8-13.2)	12.1 (11.3-13.4)	11.7 (10.2-12.6)	 	Platelet count, x 109/L	210 (147-260)	207 (158-237)	211 (128-279)	 	 &lt;150	27 (26)	11 (20)	16 (33)	 	Prothrombin time, s (n = 70)	14.1 (13.4-15.8)	14 (13.2-16.3)	14.2 (13.5-15.6)	 	Partial thromboplastin time, s (n = 53)	35 (30-40)	36 (31-40)	33.5 (30-41)	 	Alanine aminotransferase, U/L (n = 94)	25 (17-39)	22 (13-31)	30 (19-55)	 	 &gt;40	21/94 (22)	6/47 (13)	15/47 (32)	 	Aspartate aminotransferase, U/L (n = 94)	32 (22-48)	27 (20-37)	39 (25-60)	 	 &gt;40	31/94 (33)	9/47 (19)	22/47 (47)	 	Total bilirubin, mg/dL (n = 94)	0.5 (0.4-0.8)	0.5 (0.4-0.7)	0.5 (0.3-0.9)	 	Blood urea nitrogen, mg/dL	21 (13-32)	16 (12-23)	26 (21-37)	 	Creatinine (serum), mg/dL	0.84 (0.66-1.32)	0.83 (0.61-1.06)	0.88 (0.69-1.45)	 	\nAll values are noted as median (interquartile range [IQR]), n of all patients (%) or a proportion of subset, n/N (%).\nOf 39 patients who had SARS-CoV-2 samples available for semi-quantitative testing, the median Ct was 26.5 (range, 12.4-35.4) with no difference between severe and nonsevere cases. Fifty samples were available for viral coinfection testing. No coinfections with influenza A or B, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza viruses, rhinovirus, or bocavirus were identified. There were no coinfections with coronaviruses 229E, NL63, OC43, or HKU1.\nAngiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) were used in 33% of patients (Table 4), whereas aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were used in 35%.

In nearly all cases it was dosed at 400 mg PO BID x 1 day, then 200 mg PO BID x 4 days, according to a published study. Remdesivir was provided to 4 patients on a compassionate use protocol. Subsequently, a clinical trial was initiated, and 21 patients were randomized to receive remdesivir or placebo. No other antiviral drugs were administered to treat COVID-19 infection. Half of patients received antibiotics for at least 48 hours during their hospitalization. Only a small fraction (3%) of all patients received corticosteroids at doses that were greater than baseline doses.\nWith respect to nonpharmacological interventions, 76% of all patients required supplemental oxygen either by nasal cannula (37%), high-flow (23%), or mechanical ventilation (18%). Two were placed on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Three patients (3%) were newly started on renal replacement therapy.\nThirty-one (30%) patients developed AKI, which tended to be present on admission (Figure 1). Shock occurred in 17 (16%) patients and occurred on median hospital day 1 (range, 0-10). Acute respiratory distress syndrome was seen in 28 (27%), and 19 (18%) underwent mechanical ventilation, with intubation occurring on median hospital day 1 (range, 0-5). Nineteen percent of patients who had a troponin sent (13 of 67) had evidence of cardiac injury. Fifty-one patients (49%) had severe illness, and 35 patients (33%) died. Among those who died, all deaths were confirmed to be COVID-19-related, and death occurred on median hospital day 7 (range, 0-20). At the end of our chart review, 66 patients survived to discharge (63%), with discharge occurring on median hospital day 9 (range, 1-53), and 4 patients remained hospitalized.\nTime to onset of COVID-19 complications.

At 3 academic hospitals in Seattle, 105 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were admitted between 2 March and 26 March 2020. Fifty-one patients (49%) had severe illness, and 35 patients (33%) died. This is a relatively high mortality rate compared to reports from China and Singapore, where mortality rates in hospitalized patients were 1.4%, 4.3%, and 0%. This is likely due to the more advanced age (median 69 years) of our cohort compared with these previous case series, which reported average ages of 47, 56, and 47. Additionally, the burden of comorbidities in our population was extremely high, with 93% of patients having at least 1 comorbidity, also higher than the previously reported rate of comorbidity of 46.4% and 32%.\nPatients living in nursing or senior living homes composed 35% of the patients, reflecting the increased risk of living in congregated settings. Aside from 1 homeless patient, the remaining 65% of patients were domiciled at private residences prior to hospitalization, indicating that the infection was already distributed throughout the community. Travel was not an important risk, indicating that infections were unlikely to be imported. Only 16% of participants reported a known contact, indicating ongoing community transmission in the several weeks between the first case and this time period.\nWith respect to comorbidities, hypertension (59%), obesity (47%), cardiovascular disease (38%), diabetes (33%), and chronic kidney disease (26%) were the most notable and tended to be more prevalent in cases with severe clinical outcomes. It is striking that 55% of the patients had 3 or more comorbidities, underscoring the vulnerability of chronically ill individuals to COVID-19. Similar associations have been observed in influenza: diabetes and cardiovascular disease are known to increase the risk of developing complications from influenza, and previous work has shown an association between obesity and poor outcomes in influenza infection. Furthermore, the association between the presence of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes with poor outcomes was documented among patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection. Chronic lung disease including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (10%) and asthma (10%) were surprisingly uncommon. Only 2 pregnant patients were observed in this cohort, and they recovered without complications. The frequency of obesity, hypertension, and diabetes associated with our hospitalized COVID-19 patients is concerning given the high prevalence of these conditions in the US population.\nOf preadmission medications, statins were the most common (42%) followed by ACE inhibitors or ARBs (33% combined). There is conflicting evidence on the effect of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors on angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). In animal models, ACE inhibitors and ARBs upregulate surface expressed ACE2, a binding target of SARS-CoV2, which could worsen disease. However, animal studies have shown that these medications decrease severe lung injury in some viral pneumonias. Our study could not determine if these medications were a risk factor for severe disease.\nFor most patients, COVID-19 was not an abrupt illness leading to sudden hospitalization; the majority (63%) of patients reported symptoms for least 5 days prior to admission. Only a minority of patients (39%) had documented fever in the first 24 hours of hospitalization. Absence of fever in some patients has been previously reported. The absence of fever in the majority of this largely geriatric cohort is an important finding. Clinicians evaluating older patients will need to have a high index of suspicion for COVID-19 in those who present without fever. Cough (72%), dyspnea (53%), and fatigue (49%) were the most common symptoms reported by patients, consistent with other studies. Gastrointestinal complaints were noted in a minority. Hypoxia and elevated temperatures in the first 24 hours of hospitalization were more frequent in severe COVID-19, but notably, there were few presenting clinical signs or symptoms that distinguished those who would go on to severe disease.\nObjective data on the patients demonstrated findings previously reported. Chest imaging was abnormal in the vast majority of patients, consistent with previous reports. A majority of patients (73%) had lymphopenia, which was more commonly observed in severe COVID-19. Transaminases were mildly elevated in 22-33% of patients but rarely more than twice the upper limit of normal. Viral coinfection was not identified, concordant with previous published studies describing influenza coinfection only in case reports.\nFew patients (3%) received corticosteroids, consistent with recent published recommendations. A subset of patients was treated with hydroxychloroquine (40%) or were enrolled in a trial with remdesivir (20%) based on preliminary data suggesting antiviral activity against SARS-CoV2; whether these provide clinical benefit remains unknown.\nA large fraction (76%) of these patients required oxygen supplementation, including 18% who received mechanical ventilation. Hemodynamic shock, which occurred in 16% of patients in this group, has been reported previously. The frequency of AKI (30%) appears higher than the reports from China of 0.5% to 7% and likely attributable to the advanced age and high comorbidity burden of our cohort, although severe illness was not limited to the elderly patients in this group.\nOur study has some limitations. First, as with any observational study derived from routinely collected clinical data, there is the potential for incomplete capture or misclassification of baseline characteristics, particularly for patients who did not receive primary care in our system. Next, this study was performed early in the COVID-19 outbreak when testing was not widespread, and attention was heavily focused on nursing homes. In addition, 4 of these patients remained hospitalized at the time of manuscript submission with partial follow-up. A larger clinical cohort may reveal additional features not readily apparent in our series.\nIn conclusion, COVID-19 has spread rapidly throughout the United States and most of the world. The early experience in Seattle indicated that patients requiring hospitalization for COVID-19 were generally of advanced age with multiple comorbidities. The high morbidity and mortality we observed underscores the urgency of widespread preventive measures to protect this vulnerable population.\nNotes\n Author contributions. H. N.

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

mortality in critical illness: an observational cohort study","abstract":"Introduction\nThe neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a biological marker that has been shown to be associated with outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.\n\n Increasing quartile of NLR was statistically significantly associated with secondary outcome.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR is associated with outcomes in unselected critically ill patients.\n\n In patients with sepsis, there was no statistically significant relationship between NLR and mortality.\n\n Further investigation is required to increase understanding of the pathophysiology of this relationship and to validate these findings with data collected prospectively.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article

a major threat to public health1–3.\n Despite intense research efforts, how, when and where new diseases appear are still a source of considerable uncertainty.\n A severe respiratory disease was recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China5.\n This outbreak highlights the ongoing ability of viral spill-over from animals to cause severe disease in humans.\n","id":"PMC7094943","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing Group

Phylodynamics","abstract":"\nViral phylodynamics is defined as the study of how epidemiological, immunological, and evolutionary processes act and potentially interact to shape viral\nphylogenies.\n Since the coining of the term in 2004, research on viral phylodynamics has focused on transmission dynamics in an effort to shed light on how these dynamics impact viral genetic variation.\n Transmission dynamics can be considered at the level of cells within an infected host, individual hosts within a population, or entire populations of hosts.\n Many viruses, especially RNA viruses, rapidly accumulate genetic variation because of short generation times and high mutation rates.\n Patterns of viral genetic variation are therefore heavily influenced by how quickly transmission occurs and by which entities transmit to one another.\n Patterns of viral genetic variation will also be affected by selection acting on viral phenotypes.\n Although viruses can differ with respect to many phenotypes, phylodynamic studies have to date tended to focus on a limited number of viral phenotypes.\n These include virulence phenotypes, phenotypes associated with viral transmissibility, cell or tissue tropism phenotypes, and antigenic phenotypes that can facilitate escape from host immunity.\n Due to the impact that transmission dynamics and selection can have on viral genetic variation, viral phylogenies can therefore be used to investigate important epidemiological, immunological, and evolutionary processes, such as epidemic spread\n[2], spatio-temporal dynamics including

Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nThe initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

influenza-like illness.\n\n Community enrollees were in age groups not well-represented from hospitals.\n\n Influenza A/H3N2 activity peaked on college campuses and homeless shelters 2 weeks before the peak in hospitals.\n\n We observed multiple independent introductions of influenza strains into the city and evidence of sustained transmission chains within the city (Figures 2 and 3).\n\n\nConclusion\nUtilizing the city-wide infrastructure we developed, we observed the introduction of influenza A/H3N2 into the community before the hospital and evidence of transmissions of unique strains into and within the Seattle area.\n\n These data provide the blueprint for implementing city-wide, community-based surveillance systems for rapid detection, real-time assessment of transmission patterns, and interruption of spread of seasonal or pandemic strains.\n\n\nDisclosures\n\nHelen Y.\n\n Chu, MD MPH, Merck (Advisor or Review Panel member), Michael Boeckh, MD PhD, Ablynx

Hospital-Acquired Human Parainfluenza Virus 3 Infections","abstract":"Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) is increasingly used for the unbiased detection of viruses, bacteria, fungi, and eukaryotic parasites in clinical samples.\n Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of clinical bacterial isolates has been shown to inform hospital infection prevention practices, but this technology has not been utilized during potential respiratory virus outbreaks.\n Here, we report on the use of mNGS to inform the real-time infection prevention response to a cluster of hospital-acquired human parainfluenza 3 virus (HPIV3) infections at a children's hospital.\n Samples from 3 patients with hospital-acquired HPIV3 identified over a 12-day period on a general medical unit and 10 temporally associated samples from patients with community-acquired HPIV3 were analyzed.\n Our sample-to-sequencer time was &lt;24 h, while our sample-to-answer turnaround time was &lt;60 h with a hands-on time of approximately 6 h.\n Eight (2 cases and 6 controls) of 13 samples had sufficient sequencing coverage to yield the whole genome for HPIV3, while 10 (2 cases and 8 controls) of 13 samples gave partial genomes and all 13 samples had &gt;1 read for HPIV3. Phylogenetic clustering revealed the presence of identical HPIV3 genomic sequence in the two of the cases with hospital-acquired infection, consistent with the concern for recent transmission within the medical unit.\n Adequate sequence coverage was not recovered for the third case.\n This work demonstrates the promise of mNGS for providing rapid information for infection prevention in addition to microbial detection.\n","id":"PMC5228228","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"American Society for Microbiology","authors":[{"firstname":"Alexander

herpesvirus 6","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>Human herpesvirus-6A and -6B (HHV-6) are betaherpesviruses that reach &gt;?90% seroprevalence in the adult population.\n\n Unique among human herpesviruses, HHV-6 can integrate into the subtelomeric regions of human chromosomes; when this occurs in germ line cells it causes a condition called inherited chromosomally integrated HHV-6 (iciHHV-6).\n\n Only two complete genomes are available for replicating HHV-6B, leading to numerous conflicting annotations and little known about the global genomic diversity of this ubiquitous virus.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par2'>Using a custom capture panel for HHV-6B, we report complete genomes from 61 isolates of HHV-6B from active infections (20 from Japan, 35 from New York state, and 6 from Uganda), and 64 strains of iciHHV-6B (mostly from North America).\n\n HHV-6B sequence clustered by geography and illustrated extensive recombination.\n\n Multiple iciHHV-6B sequences from unrelated individuals across the United States were found to be completely identical, consistent with a founder effect.\n\n Several iciHHV-6B strains clustered with strains from recent active pediatric infection.\n\n Combining our genomic analysis with the first RNA-Seq and shotgun proteomics studies of HHV-6B, we completely reannotated the HHV-6B genome, altering annotations for more than 10% of existing genes, with multiple instances of novel splicing and genes that hitherto had gone unannotated.\n\n\nConclusion\nid='Par3'>Our results are consistent with a model of intermittent de novo integration of HHV-6B into host germline cells during active infection with a large contribution of founder effect in iciHHV-6B.\n\n Our data provide a significant advance in the genomic annotation of HHV-6B, which will contribute to the detection, diversity, and control of this virus.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (10.1186/s12864-018-4604-2) contains

inherent heuristics to find optimal trees, it is not clear whether the best tree is found.\n Thus, there is need for additional approaches that employ different search strategies to find ML trees and that are at the same time as fast as currently available ML programs.\n We show that a combination of hill-climbing approaches and a stochastic perturbation method can be time-efficiently implemented.\n If we allow the same CPU time as RAxML and PhyML, then our software IQ-TREE found higher likelihoods between 62.2% and 87.1% of the studied alignments, thus efficiently exploring the tree-space.\n If we use the IQ-TREE stopping rule, RAxML and PhyML are faster in 75.7% and 47.1% of the DNA alignments and 42.2% and 100% of the protein alignments, respectively.\n However, the range of obtaining higher likelihoods with IQ-TREE improves to 73.3–97.1%.\n IQ-TREE is freely available at

By extracting and analyzing all available published clinical data, we identified several major clinical characteristics associated with increased disease severity and mortality among patients with COVID-19. Specifically, preexisting chronic conditions such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes are strongly associated with an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19; surprisingly, however, we found no correlation between chronic liver disease and increased disease severity.\n In addition, we found that both acute cardiac injury and acute kidney injury are highly correlated with an increased risk of COVID-19-related mortality.\n Given the high risk of comorbidity and the high mortality rate associated with tissue damage, organ function should be monitored closely in patients diagnosed with COVID-19, and this approach should be included when establishing new guidelines for managing these high-risk patients.\n Moreover, additional clinical data are needed in order to determine whether a supportive therapy can help mitigate the development of severe, potentially fatal complications, and further studies are needed to identify the pathophysiology and the mechanism underlying this novel coronavirus-associated infectious disease.\n Taken together, these findings provide new insights regarding clinical strategies for improving the management and outcome of patients with COVID-19.","id":"PMC7187729","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"AAAS","authors":[{"firstname":"Xinhui","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xuexian","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Xuexian","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhaoxian","surname":"Cai","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Zhaoxian","surname":"Cai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaotian","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiaotong","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Xiaotong","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Junxia","surname":"Min","email":"junxiamin@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Junxia","surname":"Min","email":"junxiamin@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fudi","surname":"Wang","email":"fwang@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Fudi","surname":"Wang","email":"fwang@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2002032","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China","abstract":"Background\nSince December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020.

patients and controls, the mean (±SD) age was 68±13 years, and 37% were women.\n\n The use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs was more common among case patients than among controls, as was the use of other antihypertensive and non-antihypertensive drugs, and case patients had a worse clinical profile.\n\n Use of ARBs or ACE inhibitors did not show any association with Covid-19 among case patients overall (adjusted odds ratio, 0.95 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.86 to 1.05] for ARBs and 0.96 [95% CI, 0.87 to 1.07] for ACE inhibitors) or among patients who had a severe or fatal course of the disease (adjusted odds ratio, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.63 to 1.10] for ARBs and 0.91 [95% CI, 0.69 to 1.21] for ACE inhibitors), and no association between these variables was found according to sex.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn this large, population-based study, the use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs was more frequent among patients with Covid-19 than among controls because of their higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease.\n\n However, there was no evidence that ACE inhibitors or ARBs affected the risk of COVID-19.\n","id":"PMC7206933","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical

inhibitors might influence the severity of COVID-19. We aimed to evaluate whether continuing versus discontinuing renin–angiotensin system inhibitors (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers) affects outcomes in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19.\nMethods\nThe REPLACE COVID trial was a prospective, randomised, open-label trial done at 20 large referral hospitals in seven countries worldwide.\n\n Eligible participants were aged 18 years and older who were admitted to hospital with COVID-19 and were receiving a renin–angiotensin system inhibitor before admission.\n\n Individuals with contraindications to continuation or discontinuation of renin–angiotensin system inhibitor therapy were excluded.\n\n Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to continuation or discontinuation of their renin–angiotensin system inhibitor using permuted block randomisation, with allocation concealed using a secure web-based randomisation system.\n\n The primary outcome was a global rank score in which participants were ranked across four hierarchical tiers incorporating time to death, duration of mechanical ventilation, time on renal replacement or vasopressor therapy, and multiorgan dysfunction during the hospitalisation.\n\n Primary analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population.\n\n The REPLACE COVID trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.\n\ngov, NCT04338009.\n\n\nFindings\nBetween March 31 and Aug 20, 2020, 152 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to either continue or discontinue renin–angiotensin system inhibitor therapy (continuation group n=75; discontinuation group n=77).\n\n Mean age of participants was 62 years (SD 12), 68 (45%) were female, mean body-mass index was 33 kg/m2 (SD 8), and 79 (52%) had diabetes.\n\n Compared with discontinuation of renin–angiotensin system inhibitors, continuation had no effect on the global rank score (median rank 73 [IQR 40–110] for continuation vs 81 [38–117] for discontinuation; ?-coefficient 8 [95% CI ?13 to 29]).\n\n There were 16 (21%) of 75 participants in the continuation arm versus 14 (18%) of 77 in the discontinuation arm who required intensive care unit admission or invasive mechanical ventilation, and 11 (15%) of 75 participants in the continuation group versus ten (13%) of 77 in the discontinuation group died.\n\n 29 (39%) participants in the continuation group and 28 (36%) participants in the discontinuation group had at least one adverse event (?2 test of adverse events between treatment groups p=0·77).\n\n There was no difference in

angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) mitigates the course o\f recent-onset COVID-19.\nMethods\nACEI-COVID was a parallel group, randomised, controlled, open-label trial done at 35 centres in Austria and Germany.\n\n Patients aged 18 years and older were enrolled if they presented with recent symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and were chronically treated with ACEIs or ARBs.\n\n Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to discontinuation or continuation of RAS inhibition for 30 days.\n\n Primary outcome was the maximum sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score within 30 days, where death was scored with the maximum achievable SOFA score.\n\n Secondary endpoints were area under the death-adjusted SOFA score (AUCSOFA), mean SOFA score, admission to the intensive care unit,

They were randomized in two groups.\n\n The former dosage of ACEis/ARBs was continued in one group while in another group, the ACEis/ARBs were replaced by amlodipine ± carvedilol according to the dose equivalents.\n\n The primary outcomes were length of stay in hospitals and intensive care units.\n\n Other outcomes include mechanical ventilation, non-invasive ventilation, readmission, and COVID-19 symptoms after discharge.\n\n\nResults\n We randomized 64 patients with COVID-19 into two groups.\n\n Most patients were aged 66-80 and 46-65 years-old, 33 (51.6%) and 27 (42.2%), respectively.\n\n The study groups were nearly similar in baseline vital signs and characteristics.\n\n In addition, there was no significant difference in terms of recorded systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements between groups.\n\n Furthermore, we did not find a significant difference between the days of intensive care unit or ward admission, the discharge rate, or readmission rates between the two groups.\n\n\nConclusions\n This randomized triple-blind multi-centric clinical trial did not show any deleterious effects of ACEi/ARB medications in hypertensive COVID-19 patients.\n\n\n","id":"PMC8344947","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Oxford University Press","authors":[{"firstname":"Farhad","surname":"Najmeddin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Maedeh","surname":"Solhjoo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Haleh","surname":"Ashraf","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mohammadreza","surname":"Salehi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Fatemeh","surname":"Rasooli","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Morteza","surname":"Ghoghaei","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Abbas","surname":"Soleimani","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Maryam","surname":"Bahreini","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1002/sim.5984","date":"2013-09-03","title":"The use of propensity score methods with survival or time-to-event outcomes: reporting measures of effect similar to those used in randomized experiments","abstract":"Propensity score methods are increasingly being used to estimate causal treatment effects in observational studies.\n In medical and epidemiological studies, outcomes are frequently time-to-event in nature.\n Propensity-score methods are often applied incorrectly when estimating the effect of treatment on time-to-event outcomes.\n This article describes how two different propensity score methods (matching and inverse probability of treatment weighting) can be used to estimate the measures of effect that are frequently reported in randomized controlled trials: (i) marginal survival curves, which describe survival in the population if all subjects were treated or if all subjects were untreated; and (ii) marginal hazard ratios.\n The use of these propensity score methods allows one to replicate the measures of effect that are commonly reported in randomized controlled trials with time-to-event outcomes: both absolute and relative reductions in the probability of an event occurring can be determined.\n We also provide guidance on variable selection for the propensity score model, highlight methods for assessing the balance of baseline covariates between treated and untreated subjects, and describe the implementation of a sensitivity analysis to assess the effect of unmeasured confounding variables on the estimated treatment effect when outcomes are time-to-event in nature.\n The methods in the paper are illustrated by estimating the effect of discharge statin prescribing on the risk of death in a sample of patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction.\n In this tutorial article, we describe and illustrate all the steps necessary to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the effect of treatment on time-to-event outcomes.\n © 2013 The authors.\n Statistics in Medicine published by John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.\n","id":"PMC4285179","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BlackWell Publishing Ltd","authors":[{"firstname":"Peter C","surname":"Austin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1093/eurheartj/ehs114","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Do observational studies using propensity score methods agree with randomized trials?

I2 = 57%, p = 0.05].\n We found no significant reduction in the risk of severe disease in the ACEI subgroup (OR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.88–1.02, I2 = 50%, p = 0.18), the ARB subgroup (OR = 1.03, 95% CI = 0.94–1.13, I2 = 62%, p = 0.48), or the ACEI/ARB subgroup (OR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.65–1.08, I2 = 67%, p = 0.16).\n Moreover, seven studies showed no significant difference in the duration of hospitalization between the two groups (mean difference = 0.33, 95% CI = ?1.75 to 2.40, p = 0.76).\n In conclusion, the use of ACEIs/ARBs appears to not have a significant effect on mortality, disease severity, or duration of hospitalization in COVID-19 patients.\n On the basis of the findings of this meta-analysis, there is no support for the cessation of treatment with ACEIs or ARBs in patients with COVID-19.","id":"PMC8107232","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Frontiers Media S.A.","authors":[{"firstname":"Xiao-Ce","surname":"Dai","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhuo-Yu","surname":"An","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zi-Yang","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zi-Zhen","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yi-Ren","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.3389/fmed.2021.703661","date":"2021-12-08","title":"Mortality and Severity in COVID-19 Patients on ACEIs and ARBs—A Systematic Review, Meta-Analysis, and Meta-Regression Analysis","abstract":"Purpose: The primary objective of this systematic review is to assess association of mortality in COVID-19 patients on Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and Angiotensin-II receptor blockers (ARBs).\n A secondary objective is to assess associations with higher severity of the disease in COVID-19 patients.\n","id":"PMC8784609","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Frontiers Media S.A.","authors":[{"firstname":"Romil","surname":"Singh","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sawai Singh","surname":"Rathore","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hira","surname":"Khan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Abhishek","surname":"Bhurwal","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mack","surname":"Sheraton","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Prithwish","surname":"Ghosh","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sohini","surname":"Anand","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Janaki","surname":"Makadia","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Fnu","surname":"Ayesha","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kiran S.","surname":"Mahapure","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ishita","surname":"Mehra","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Aysun","surname":"Tekin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rahul","surname":"Kashyap","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Vikas","surname":"Bansal","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.7326/M20-1515","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Risks and Impact of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors or Angiotensin-Receptor Blockers on SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Adults","abstract":"Background:\nThe role of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) in COVID-19 disease susceptibility, severity, and treatment is unclear.\n\n\nPurpose:\nTo evaluate, on an ongoing basis, whether use of ACEIs or ARBs either increases risk for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection or is associated with worse COVID-19 disease outcomes, and to assess the efficacy of these medications for COVID-19 treatment.\n\n\nData Sources:\nMEDLINE (Ovid) and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from 2003 to 4 May 2020, with planned ongoing surveillance for 1 year;

assigned patients to receive oral or intravenous dexamethasone (at a dose of 6 mg once daily) for up to 10 days or to receive usual care alone.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality.\n\n Here, we report the preliminary results of this comparison.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 2104 patients were assigned to receive dexamethasone and 4321 to receive usual care.\n\n Overall, 482 patients (22.9%) in

Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) first broke out in Wuhan (China) and subsequently spread worldwide.\n\n Chloroquine has been sporadically used in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n Hydroxychloroquine shares the same mechanism of action as chloroquine, but its more tolerable safety profile makes it the preferred drug to treat malaria and autoimmune conditions.\n\n We propose that the

evidence to support the use of hydroxychloroquine in SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n\nMethods\nThe pharmacological activity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine was tested using SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero cells.\n\n Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models (PBPK) were implemented for both drugs separately by integrating their in vitro data.\n\n Using the PBPK models, hydroxychloroquine concentrations in lung fluid were simulated under 5 different dosing regimens to explore the most effective regimen whilst considering the drug’s safety profile.\n\n\nResults\nHydroxychloroquine (EC50=0.72 ?M) was found to be more potent than chloroquine (EC50=5.47 ?M) in vitro.\n\n Based on PBPK models results, a loading dose of 400 mg twice daily of hydroxychloroquine sulfate given orally,

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7121484","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical Society","authors":[{"firstname":"Qun","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuhua","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoye","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yeqing","surname":"Tong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ruiqi","surname":"Ren","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kathy S.M.","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Eric H.Y.","surname":"Lau","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jessica Y.","surname":"Wong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuesen","surname":"Xing","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nijuan","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chao","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tian","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Man","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wenxiao","surname":"Tu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chuding","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lianmei","surname":"Jin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rui","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Suhua","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rui","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yinbo","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ge","surname":"Shao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhongfa","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhiqiang","surname":"Deng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Boxi","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhitao","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yanping","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guoqing","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tommy T.Y.","surname":"Lam","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Joseph T.","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"George F.","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Benjamin J.","surname":"Cowling","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gabriel M.","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zijian","surname":"Feng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30154-9","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis

suffering from various forms of naturally acquired feline infectious peritonitis (FIP).\n\n\nMethods\nCats ranged from 3.4–73 months of age (mean 13.6 months); 26 had effusive or dry-to-effusive FIP and five had non-effusive disease.\n\n Cats with severe neurological and ocular FIP were not recruited.\n\n The group was started on GS-441524 at a dosage of 2.0 mg/kg SC q24h for at least 12 weeks and increased when indicated to 4.0 mg/kg SC q24h.\n\n\nResults\nFour of the 31 cats that presented with severe disease died or were euthanized within 2–5 days and a fifth cat after 26 days.\n\n The 26 remaining cats completed the planned 12 weeks or more of treatment.\n\n Eighteen of these 26 cats remain healthy at the time of publication (OnlineFirst, February 2019) after one round of treatment, while eight others suffered disease relapses within 3–84 days.\n\n Six of the relapses were non-neurological and two neurological.\n\n Three of the eight relapsing cats were treated again at the same dosage, while five cats had the dosage increased from 2.0 to 4.0 mg/kg q24h.\n\n The five cats treated a second time at the higher dosage, including one with neurological disease, responded well and also remain healthy at the time of publication.\n\n However, one of the three cats re-treated at the original lower dosage relapsed with neurological disease and was euthanized, while the two remaining cats responded favorably but relapsed a second time.\n\n These two cats were successfully treated a third time at the higher dosage, producing 25 long-time survivors.\n\n One of the 25 successfully treated cats was subsequently euthanized due to presumably unrelated heart disease, while 24 remain healthy.\n\n\nConclusions and relevance\nGS-441524 was shown to be a safe and

of Inhibition of Ebola Virus RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase by Remdesivir","abstract":"Remdesivir (GS-5734) is a 1?-cyano-substituted adenosine nucleotide analogue prodrug that shows broad-spectrum antiviral activity against several RNA viruses.\n This compound is currently under clinical development for the treatment of Ebola virus disease (EVD).\n While antiviral effects have been demonstrated in cell culture and in non-human primates, the mechanism of action of Ebola virus (EBOV) inhibition for remdesivir remains to be fully elucidated.\n The EBOV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) complex was recently expressed and purified, enabling biochemical studies with the relevant triphosphate (TP) form of remdesivir and its presumptive target.\n In this study, we confirmed that remdesivir-TP is able to compete for incorporation with adenosine triphosphate (ATP).\n Enzyme kinetics revealed that EBOV RdRp and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) RdRp incorporate ATP and remdesivir-TP with similar efficiencies.\n The selectivity of ATP against remdesivir-TP is ~4 for EBOV RdRp and ~3 for RSV RdRp.\n In contrast, purified human mitochondrial RNA polymerase (h-mtRNAP) effectively discriminates against remdesivir-TP with a selectivity value of ~500-fold.\n For EBOV RdRp, the incorporated inhibitor at position i does not affect the ensuing nucleotide incorporation event at position i+1. For RSV RdRp, we measured a ~6-fold inhibition at position i+1 although RNA synthesis was not terminated.\n Chain termination was in both cases delayed and was seen predominantly at position i+5. This pattern is specific to remdesivir-TP and its 1?-cyano modification.\n Compounds with modifications at the 2?-position show different patterns of inhibition.\n While 2?-C-methyl-ATP is not incorporated, ara-ATP acts as a non-obligate chain terminator and prevents nucleotide incorporation at position i+1. Taken together, our biochemical data indicate that the major contribution to EBOV RNA synthesis inhibition by remdesivir can be ascribed to delayed chain termination.\n The long distance of five residues between the incorporated nucleotide analogue and its inhibitory effect warrant further investigation.\n ","id":"PMC6520719","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"Egor P.","surname":"Tchesnokov","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Joy Y.","surname":"Feng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Danielle P.","surname":"Porter","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Matthias","surname":"Götte","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1128/mBio.00221-18","date":"2018-02-01","title":"Coronavirus Susceptibility to the Antiviral Remdesivir (GS-5734) Is Mediated by the Viral Polymerase and the Proofreading Exoribonuclease","abstract":"Emerging coronaviruses (CoVs) cause severe disease in humans, but no approved therapeutics are available.\n The CoV nsp14 exoribonuclease (ExoN) has complicated development of antiviral nucleosides due to its proofreading activity.\n We recently reported that the nucleoside analogue GS-5734 (remdesivir) potently inhibits human and zoonotic CoVs in vitro and in a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) mouse model.\n However, studies with GS-5734 have not reported resistance associated with GS-5734, nor do we understand the action of GS-5734 in wild-type (WT) proofreading CoVs.\n Here, we show that GS-5734 inhibits murine hepatitis virus (MHV) with similar 50% effective concentration values (EC50) as SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).\n Passage of WT MHV in the presence of the GS-5734 parent nucleoside selected two mutations in the nsp12 polymerase at residues conserved across all CoVs that conferred up to 5.6-fold resistance to GS-5734, as determined by EC50.\n The resistant viruses were unable to compete with WT in direct coinfection passage in the absence of GS-5734. Introduction of the MHV resistance mutations into SARS-CoV resulted in the same in vitro resistance phenotype and attenuated SARS-CoV pathogenesis in a mouse model.\n Finally, we demonstrate that an MHV mutant lacking ExoN proofreading was significantly more sensitive to GS-5734. Combined, the results indicate that GS-5734 interferes with the nsp12 polymerase even in the setting of intact ExoN proofreading activity and that resistance can be overcome with increased, nontoxic concentrations of GS-5734, further supporting the development of GS-5734 as a broad-spectrum therapeutic to protect against contemporary and emerging

report","abstract":"Background\nThere are thousands of survivors of the 2014 Ebola outbreak in west Africa.\n\n Ebola virus can persist in survivors for months in immune-privileged sites; however, viral relapse causing life-threatening and potentially transmissible disease has not been described.\n\n We report a case of late relapse in a patient who had been treated for severe Ebola virus disease with high viral load (peak cycle threshold value 13·2).\n\n\nMethods\nA 39-year-old female nurse from Scotland, who had assisted the humanitarian effort in Sierra Leone, had received intensive supportive treatment and experimental antiviral therapies, and had been discharged with undetectable Ebola virus RNA in peripheral blood.\n\n The patient was readmitted to hospital 9 months after discharge with symptoms of acute meningitis, and was found to have Ebola virus in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).\n\n She was treated with supportive therapy and experimental antiviral drug GS-5734 (Gilead Sciences, San Francisco, Foster City, CA, USA).\n\n We monitored Ebola virus RNA in CSF and plasma, and sequenced the viral genome using an unbiased metagenomic approach.\n\n\nFindings\nOn admission, reverse transcriptase PCR identified Ebola virus RNA at a higher level in CSF (cycle threshold value 23·7) than plasma (31·3); infectious virus was only recovered from CSF.\n\n The patient developed progressive meningoencephalitis with cranial neuropathies and radiculopathy.\n\n Clinical recovery was associated with addition of high-dose corticosteroids during GS-5734 treatment.\n\n CSF Ebola virus RNA slowly declined and was undetectable following 14 days of treatment with GS-5734. Sequencing of plasma and CSF viral genome revealed only two non-coding changes compared with the original infecting virus.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur report shows that previously unanticipated, late, severe relapses of Ebola virus can occur, in this case in the CNS.\n\n This finding fundamentally redefines what is known about the natural history of Ebola virus infection.\n\n Vigilance should be maintained in the thousands of Ebola survivors for cases of relapsed infection.\n\n The potential for these cases to initiate new transmission chains is a serious public health concern.\n\n\nFunding\nRoyal Free London NHS Foundation
