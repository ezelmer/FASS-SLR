The COVID-19 has been affirmed to have human-to-human transmissibility, which raised high attention not only in China but internationally. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that there are 118,319 confirmed cases and 4292 deaths globally until March 11, 2020, and evaluated as global pandemic on the same day.\nIn retrospect studies, the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Guangdong in 2003 gradually faded with the warming weather coming, and was basically ended until July. It has been documented that the temperature and its variations might have affected the SARS outbreak. A study in Korea found that the risk of influenza incidence was significantly increased with low daily temperature and low relative humidity, a positive significant association was observed for diurnal temperature range (DTR). Moreover, temperature and DTR have been linked to the death from respiratory diseases. A study demonstrated that absolute humidity had significant correlations with influenza viral survival and transmission rates. Few studies reported that the COVID-19 was related to the meteorological factors, which decreased with the temperature increasing, but their effects on the mortality have not been reported. Therefore, we assume that the weather conditions might also contributed to the mortality of COVID-19.\nAs the capital of Hubei Province and one of the largest cities in Central China, Wuhan is located in the middle of the Yangtze River Delta, which has a typical subtropical, humid, monsoon climate with cold winters and warm summers. The average annual temperature and rainfall are 15.8  C-17.5  C and 1050 mm-2000 mm, respectively. Besides, Wuhan owns an area of 8569 km2 and a population over 10 million (as of 2017). As of 24 March 2020, this COVID-19 has caused 16,231 deaths globally and 2524 deaths in Wuhan. Although the COVID-19 deaths may be affected by many factors, this study is to explore the effect from meteorological parameters on COVID-19 deaths using generalized additive model (GAM).\nMethods\nData collection\nData from 20 January 2020 to 29 February 2020 in Wuhan were compiled, including daily death numbers of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), meteorological and air pollutant data. Daily death data of COVID-19 were collected from the official website of Health Commission of Hubei Province, people's Republic of China (http://wjw.hubei.gov.cn/). Daily meteorological and air pollutant data were obtained from Shanghai Meteorological Bureau and Data Center of Ministry of Ecology and Environment of the People's Republic of China, respectively. Meteorological variables included daily average temperature, diurnal temperature range (DTR) and relative humidity, and air pollutant data included particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter &lt;=10 mum (PM10), particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter &lt;=2.5 mum (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3). Therefore, there is no need to have ethical review.\nCalculation of absolute humidity\nAbsolute humidity was calculated according to the previous study and was measured by vapor pressure (VP). The density of water vapor, or absolute humidity [rhov (g/m3)], is the mass of moisture per total volume of air. It is associated to VP via the ideal gas law for the moist portion of the air:where e is vapor pressure (VP), Rv is the gas constant for water vapor [461.53 J/(kg K)], and T is the daily ambient temperature (K). VP is a commonly used indicator of absolute humidity and is calculated from ambient temperature and relative humidity using the Clausius-Clapeyron relation. Briefly, we first calculated the saturation vapor pressure [es (T) (mb)] from daily ambient temperature using the following equation:where es (T0) denotes saturation vapor pressure at a reference temperature T0 (273.15 K) which equals to 6.11 mb. L denotes the latent heat of evaporation for water (2257 kJ/kg). Rv is the gas constant for water vapor [461.53 J/(kg K)]. T denotes daily ambient temperature (K). Then, VP (Pa) was calculated by combining the es (T) calculated using Eq. (2) with relative humidity (RH): \nStatistical methods\nThe descriptive analysis was performed for all the data. We used GAM to analyze the associations between meteorological factors (temperature, DTR, relative humidity and absolute humidity) and the daily death counts of COVID-19. The core analysis was a GAM with a quasi-Poisson link function based on the previous studies. We first built the basic models for death outcomes without including air pollution or weather variables. We incorporated smoothed spline functions of time, which accommodate nonlinear and nonmonotonic patterns between mortality and time, thus offering a flexible modeling tool. Then, we introduced the weather variables and analyzed their effects on mortality. Akaike's information criterion was used as a measure of how well the model fitted the data. Consistent with several recent time-series studies, the penalized smoothing spline function was applied to control the effects of confounding factors, such as time trends, day-of-week and air pollution. The core GAM equation is:where t is the day of the observation; E(Yt) is the expected number of daily mortality for COVID-19 on day t; alpha is the intercept; beta is the regression coefficient; Xt is the daily level of weather variables on day t; s() denotes the smoother based on the penalized smoothing spline. Based on Akaike's information criterion (AIC), the 2 degrees of freedom (df) is used for time trends and 3 df for air pollutants, temperature and relative humidity; DOW is a categorical variable indicating the date of the week.\nAfter establishing the core model, we considered the lag effects of weather conditions on death of COVID-19, and examined the potentially lagged effects, i.e., single day lag (from lag 0 to lag 5) and multiple-day average lag (from lag 01 to lag 05). The exposure and response correlation curves between weather variables and COVID-19 mortality were fitted using a spline function in the GAM. We also performed a sensitivity analysis by changing the df of the penalized smoothing spline function from 2 to 9 for calendar time and from 3 to 8 for temperature and humidity.\nAll the statistical analyses were two-sided at a 5% level of significance. All analyses were conducted using R software (version 3.5.3) with the &quot;mgcv&quot; package (version 1.8-27). The effect estimates were expressed as the percentage changes and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) in daily death of COVID-19 associated with per 1 unit increase in weather variables.\nResults\nDescription of COVID-19 daily mortality, meteorological variables and air pollutants\nSummary of COVID-19 death counts, meteorological data and air pollutants.\nTable 1	 	\nVariables	Daily measures	 	Mean +- S.D.

The mortality counts of COVID-19 were negatively associated with relative humidity (r = -0.32), PM2.5 (r = -0.53) and PM10 (r = -0.45). A positive association with COVID-19 daily mortality was observed for DTR (r = 0.44) and SO2 (r = 0.31).\nEffects of temperature, humidity and DTR on COVID-19 mortality\nThe exposure-response curves of meteorological factors and COVID-19 daily mortality counts in Wuhan, China, from 20 January to 29 February 2020.

COVID-19, Corona Virus Disease 2019; DTR, diurnal temperature range.\nFig. 2\n Fig. 2 showed the exposure-response relationship curves between meteorological factors and COVID-19 mortality at the same day (lag 0). Generally, the curves tended to be not associated with COVID-19 mortality for DTR but were strongly positive for temperature. In addition, the curves associated with relative humidity and absolute humidity presented similar linear trends, which indicated that the higher level of humidity might cause decrease in the COVID-19 mortality. To confirm these results, lag and cumulative effects were discussed in the following analysis.\nPercentage change (95% confidence interval) of COVID-19 daily mortality with per 1 unit increase in meteorological factors for different lag days in the models in Wuhan, China, from 20 January to 29 February 2020. COVID-19, Corona Virus Disease 2019; DTR, diurnal temperature range.\nFig. 3\n Fig. 3 displayed the percentage changes of COVID-19 mortality with per 1 unit increase in meteorological factor levels with different lag days in the models. DTR was significantly associated with the increased COVID-19 mortality, while temperature and absolute humidity with the decreased COVID-19 mortality, after controlling the effects of air pollution and other factors. Each 1 unit increase in DTR was only associated with a 2.92% (95% CI: 0.61%, 5.28%) increase in COVID-19 death counts in lag 3. However, both per 1 unit increase of temperature and absolute humidity were related to the decreased COVID-19 death counts in lag 3 and lag 5, with the greatest decrease both in lag 3 [-7.50% (95% CI: -10.99%, -3.88%) and - 11.41% (95% CI: -19.68%, -2.29%)]. For cumulative effect, no substantial result was observed in this study.\nDiscussion\nCOVID-19 outbreak has caused great health burden around the world. In this study, we examined the relationship between meteorological factors and COVID-19. Our results showed significant positive effect of DTR on the daily mortality of COVID-19, and a significant negative association between COVID-19 mortality and ambient temperature as well as absolute humidity. The results indicate that the effects of DTR and humidity should also be paid attention when estimating the death causes of COVID-19.\nOur study demonstrated a negative association between COVID-19 mortality and temperature, while a positive association for DTR. The results are consistent with the other studies. Couple of studies reported that respiratory diseases mortality increased with decreasing temperature, and was strongly associated with low temperature. While another study found that both cold and heat effects might have adverse impacts on respiratory mortality. Otherwise, the study conducted in 30 East Asian cities showed that increased DTR was associated with increased risk of mortality for respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. In the cold season, the cumulative relative risk of non-accidental, respiratory and cardiovascular death increased at high DTR values in Tabriz. A time-series study conducted in Shanghai about the effect of DTR on daily chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) mortality showed that each 1  C elevation in the 4-day moving average for DTR accounted for 1.25% of increased risk of COPD mortality. A review for cold exposure and immune function reported that lower temperature may repress the immune function. In particular, our previous finding suggested that the phagocytic function of pulmonary alveolar macrophages declined under cold stress in vitro experiment. Breathing cold air can lead to bronchial constriction, which may promote susceptibility to pulmonary infection. Additionally, since SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to heat, and high temperature makes it difficult to survive, not to mention the beneficial factors for virus transmission like indoor crowding and poor ventilation in cold days. Also, cold temperature has been discovered to be associated with the reduction of lung function and increases in exacerbations for people with COPD. DTR represents a stable measure of temperature, which is an indicator of temperature variability to evaluate effects on human health, including mortality and morbidity. Also, abrupt temperature changes may add to the burden of cardiac and respiratory system causing cardiopulmonary events and high DTR levels may be a source of environmental stress. It is said that the windows of inpatient wards were asked to remain open for 24 h a day and avoid using air conditioning in Wuhan hospitals due to ventilation necessity, therefore the indoor variation trend of meteorological factors could be very close to the outdoor environment. Concerning about this condition and our results, it is reasonable to sustain a stable and comfortable environment for the patients during therapy.\nResearchers confirmed that respiratory infection was enhanced during unusually cold and low humidity conditions, indicating low humidity might also be an important risk factor for respiratory diseases. A 25-year study found that humidity was an important determinant of mortality, and low-humidity levels might cause a large increase in mortality rates, potentially by influenza-related mechanisms, similar to a study carried out in the United States. Consistent to these findings, our results also indicate that the risk of dying from COVID-19 decreases only with absolute humidity increasing. Breathing dry air could cause epithelial damage and/or reduction of mucociliary clearance, and then lead to render the host more susceptible to respiratory virus infection; The formation of droplet nuclei is essential to transmission, but exhaled respiratory droplets settle very rapidly at high humidity so that it is hard to contribute to influenza virus spread. Moreover, the transmission of pandemic influenza virus is efficient under cold, dry conditions, and influenza virus survival rate increased markedly in accordance with decreasing of absolute humidity, which may be very similar to coronavirus. Therefore, the increase of COVID-19 mortality may also be related to the lower humidity in winter.\nHowever, many limitations should not be ignored. Firstly, there are some other important factors that may affect the COVID-19 mortality, such as government interventions, medical resources and so on. Therefore, these issues should be examined in future studies. Secondly, ecologic time-series study design was adopted in the study, which might have ecologic fallacy to some degree. Furthermore, it is difficult to obtain the meteorological and air pollution data at the individual level, although the outdoor and indoor air environment might be similar due to the air conditioner off using and window opening for 24 h in the hospital patient wards during COVID-19 therapy. Nevertheless, this study showed that DTR and humidity might affect the mortality of COVID-19 in Wuhan, which deserves further investigation from a larger range of studying area.\nConclusion\nThis is the first study to investigate the effects of temperature, DTR and humidity on the daily mortality of COVID-19 in Chinese population. Our finding shows that the daily mortality of COVID-19 is positively associated with DTR but negatively with absolute humidity. In summary, this study suggests the temperature variation and humidity may also be important factors affecting the COVID-19 mortality. And our results suggest that it is reasonable to sustain a stable and comfortable environment for the patients during therapy.\nAbbreviations\nCOVID-19\nCorona Virus Disease 2019\nTem\ntemperature\nDTR\ndiurnal temperature range\nRH\nrelative humidity\nAH\nabsolute humidity\nPM2.5\nparticulate matter with aerodynamic diameter &lt;=2.5 mum\nPM10\nparticulate matter with aerodynamic diameter &lt;=10 mum\nNO2\nnitrogen dioxide\nSO2\nsulfur dioxide\nCO\ncarbon monoxide\nO3\nozone\nGAM\ngeneralized additive model\nCI\nconfidence interval\nRR\nrelative risk\nEthical approval and consent to participate\nNot applicable.\nConsent for publication\nNot applicable.\nAvailability of supporting data\nThe datasets used and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the websites.\nFunding\nThis work was supported by the  (4187050043) and the .\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n Yueling Ma: Writing - original draft, Software.

European cities","abstract":"Background\nEurope has experienced warmer summers in the past two decades and there is a need to describe the determinants of heat-related mortality to better inform public health activities during hot weather.\n\n We investigated the effect of high temperatures on daily mortality in three cities in Europe (Budapest, London, and Milan), using a standard approach.\n\n\nMethods\nAn ecological time-series study of daily mortality was conducted in three cities using Poisson generalized linear models allowing for over-dispersion.\n\n Secular trends in mortality and seasonal confounding factors were controlled for using cubic smoothing splines of time.\n\n Heat exposure was modelled using average values of the temperature measure on the same day as death (lag 0) and the day before (lag 1).\n\n The heat effect was quantified assuming a linear increase in risk above a cut-point for each city.\n\n Socio-economic status indicators and census data were linked with mortality data for stratified analyses.\n\n\nResults\nThe risk of heat-related death increased with age, and females had a greater risk than males in age groups ?65 years in London and Milan.\n\n The relative risks of mortality (per °C) above the heat cut-point by gender and age were: (i) Male 1.10 (95%CI: 1.07–1.12) and Female 1.07 (1.05–1.10) for 75–84 years, (ii) M 1.10 (1.06–1.14) and F 1.08 (1.06–1.11) for ?85 years in Budapest (?24°C); (i) M 1.03 (1.01–1.04) and F 1.07 (1.05–1.09), (ii) M 1.05 (1.03–1.07) and F 1.08 (1.07–1.10) in London (?20°C); and (i) M 1.08 (1.03–1.14) and F 1.20 (1.15–1.26), (ii) M 1.18 (1.11–1.26) and F 1.19 (1.15–1.24) in Milan (?26°C).\n\n Mortality from external causes increases at higher temperatures as well as that from respiratory and cardiovascular disease.\n\n There was no clear evidence of effect modification by socio-economic status in either Budapest or London, but there was a seemingly higher risk for affluent non-elderly adults in Milan.\n\n\nConclusion\nWe found broadly consistent determinants (age, gender, and cause of death) of heat related mortality in three European cities using a standard approach.\n\n Our results are consistent with previous evidence for individual determinants, and also confirm the lack of a strong socio-economic gradient in heat health effects currently in Europe.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2266730","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

2008.\nMethods\nPubMed was used to search for the following keywords: temperature, apparent temperature, heat, heat index, and mortality.\n\n The search was limited to the English language and epidemiologic studies.\n\n Studies that reported mortality counts or excess deaths following heat waves were excluded so that the focus remained on general ambient temperature and mortality in a variety of locations.\n\n Studies focusing on cold temperature effects were also excluded.\n\n\nResults\nThirty-six total studies were presented in three tables: 1) elevated ambient temperature and mortality; 2) air pollutants as confounders and/or effect modifiers of the elevated ambient temperature and mortality association; and 3) vulnerable subgroups of the elevated ambient temperature-mortality association.\n\n The evidence suggests that particulate matter with less than 10 um in aerodynamic diameter and ozone may confound the association, while ozone was an effect modifier in the warmer months in some locations.\n\n Nonetheless, the independent effect of temperature and mortality was withheld.\n\n Elevated temperature was associated with increased risk for those dying from cardiovascular, respiratory, cerebrovascular, and some specific cardiovascular diseases, such as ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, and myocardial infarction.\n\n Vulnerable subgroups also included: Black racial/ethnic group, women, those with lower socioeconomic status, and several age groups, particularly the elderly over 65 years of age as well as infants and young children.\n\n\nConclusion\nMany of these outcomes and vulnerable subgroups have only been identified in recent studies and varied by location and study population.\n\n Thus, region-specific policies, especially in urban areas, are vital to the mitigation of heat-related deaths.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2759912","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

Meta-analysis of Epidemiological Evidence","abstract":"Introduction\nClimate change and rapid population ageing are significant public health challenges.\n\n Understanding which health problems are affected by temperature is important for preventing heat and cold-related deaths and illnesses, particularly in the elderly.\n\n Here we present a systematic review and meta-analysis on the effects of ambient hot and cold temperature (excluding heat/cold wave only studies) on elderly (65 + years) mortality and morbidity.\n\n\nMethods\nTime-series or case-crossover studies comprising cause-specific cases of elderly mortality (n = 3,933,398) or morbidity (n = 12,157,782) were pooled to obtain a percent change (%) in risk for temperature exposure on cause-specific disease outcomes using a random-effects meta-analysis.\n\n\nResults\nA 1 °C temperature rise increased cardiovascular (3.44%, 95% CI 3.10–3.78), respiratory (3.60%, 3.18–4.02), and cerebrovascular (1.40%, 0.06–2.75) mortality.\n\n A 1 °C temperature reduction increased respiratory (2.90%, 1.84–3.97) and cardiovascular (1.66%, 1.19–2.14) mortality.\n\n The greatest risk was associated with cold-induced pneumonia (6.89%, 20–12.99) and respiratory morbidity (4.93% 1.54–8.44).\n\n A 1 °C temperature rise increased cardiovascular, respiratory, diabetes mellitus, genitourinary, infectious disease and heat-related morbidity.\n\n\nDiscussion\nElevated risks for the elderly were prominent for temperature-induced cerebrovascular, cardiovascular, diabetes, genitourinary, infectious disease, heat-related, and respiratory outcomes.\n\n These risks will likely increase with climate change and global

interaction is not known.\n\n\nMethods\nThis time-series analysis examined the effect of the interaction between outdoor air pollutants and extreme temperature on daily mortality in Shanghai, China.\n\n A generalized additive model (GAM) with penalized splines was used to analyze mortality, air pollution, temperature, and covariate data.\n\n The effects of air pollutants were stratified by temperature stratum to examine the interaction effect of air pollutants and extreme temperature.\n\n\nResults\nWe found a statistically significant interaction between PM10/O3 and extreme low

host, we show that aerosol spread of influenza virus is dependent upon both ambient relative humidity and temperature.\n Twenty experiments performed at relative humidities from 20% to 80% and 5 °C, 20 °C, or 30 °C indicated that both cold and dry conditions favor transmission.\n The relationship between transmission via aerosols and relative humidity at 20 °C is similar to that previously reported for the stability of influenza viruses (except at high relative humidity, 80%), implying that the effects of humidity act largely at the level of the virus particle.\n For infected guinea pigs housed at 5 °C, the duration of peak shedding was approximately 40 h longer than that of animals housed at 20 °C; this increased shedding likely accounts for the enhanced transmission seen at 5 °C.\n To investigate the mechanism permitting prolonged viral growth, expression levels in the upper respiratory tract of several innate immune mediators were determined.\n Innate responses proved to be comparable between animals housed at 5 °C and 20 °C, suggesting that cold temperature (5 °C) does not impair the innate immune response in this system.\n Although the seasonal epidemiology of influenza is well characterized, the underlying reasons for predominant wintertime spread are not clear.\n We provide direct, experimental evidence to support the role of weather conditions in the dynamics of influenza and thereby address a long-standing question fundamental to the understanding of influenza epidemiology and

region.\n\n In addition, the effect of diurnal temperature range on influenza incidence is unclear, according to previous study findings.\n\n\nObjectives\nThe aim of this study was to analyze the effects of temperature, humidity, and diurnal temperature range on the incidence of influenza in Seoul, Republic of Korea, which is located in a temperate region.\n\n\nMethods\nWe used Korean National Health insurance data to assess the weekly influenza incidence between 2010 and 2016, and used meteorological data from Seoul.\n\n To investigate the effect of temperature, relative humidity, and diurnal temperature range levels on influenza incidence, we used a distributed lag non?linear model.\n\n\nResults\nThe risk of influenza incidence was significantly increased with low daily

Three methodologies were used to evaluate the isolated association: time-series analysis using Poisson regression model, bidirectional case-crossover analysis matched by period, and case-crossover analysis matched by the confounding factor, i.\n\ne.\n\n, average temperature or pollutant concentration.\n\n The graphical representation of the response surface, generated by the interaction term between these factors added to the Poisson regression model, was interpreted to evaluate the synergistic effect of the risk factors.\n\n\nRESULTS\nNo differences were observed between the results of the case-crossover and time-series analyses.\n\n The percentage change in the relative risk of cardiovascular and respiratory mortality was 0.85% (0.45;1.25) and 1.60% (0.74;2.46), respectively, due to an increase of 10 ?g/m3 in the PM10 concentration.\n\n The pattern of correlation of the temperature with cardiovascular mortality was U-shaped and that with respiratory mortality was J-shaped, indicating an increased relative risk at high temperatures.\n\n The values for the interaction term indicated a higher relative risk for cardiovascular and respiratory mortalities at low temperatures and high temperatures, respectively, when the pollution levels reached approximately 60 ?g/m3.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe positive association standardized in the Poisson regression model for pollutant concentration is not confounded by temperature, and the effect of temperature is not confounded by the pollutant levels in the time-series analysis.\n\n The simultaneous exposure to different levels of environmental factors can create synergistic effects that are as disturbing as those caused by extreme concentrations.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4285836","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Faculdade de Saúde Pública da Universidade de São Paulo","authors":[{"firstname":"Samya de Lara Lins de

UK media framing of the 2003 SARS epidemic","abstract":"Since the emergence of HIV/AIDS in the 1980s, social scientists and sociologists of health and illness have been exploring the metaphorical framing of this infectious disease in its social context.\n Many have focused on the militaristic language used to report and explain this illness, a type of language that has permeated discourses of immunology, bacteriology and infection for at least a century.\n In this article, we examine how language and metaphor were used in the UK media's coverage of another previously unknown and severe infectious disease: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).\n SARS offers an opportunity to explore the cultural framing of a less extraordinary epidemic disease.\n It therefore provides an analytical counter-weight to the very extensive body of interpretation that has developed around HIV/AIDS.\n By analysing the total reporting on SARS of five major national newspapers during the epidemic of spring 2003, we investigate how the reporting of SARS in the UK press was framed, and how this related to media, public and governmental responses to the disease.\n We found that, surprisingly, militaristic language was largely absent, as was the judgemental discourse of plague.\n Rather, the main conceptual metaphor used was SARS as a killer.\n SARS as a killer was a single unified entity, not an army or force.\n We provide some tentative explanations for this shift in linguistic framing by relating it to local political concerns, media cultures, and spatial factors.\n","id":"PMC7117051","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission,

develop the family of distributed lag non-linear models (DLNM), a modelling framework that can simultaneously represent non-linear exposure–response dependencies and delayed effects.\n This methodology is based on the definition of a ‘cross-basis’, a bi-dimensional space of functions that describes simultaneously the shape of the relationship along both the space of the predictor and the

present an analysis of medium-term (weeks to months) exposure effects of particulate pollution and temperature.\n We assessed the associations of particulate pollution (black smoke) and temperature with age-standardized daily mortality rates over 17 years in Dublin, Ireland, using a polynomial distributed lag model of both temperature and particulate air pollution simultaneously through 40 days after exposure.\n When only acute effects (3-day mean) were considered, we found total mortality increased by 0.4% for each 10-microg/m3 increase in black smoke concentration.\n When deaths in the 40 days after exposure were considered, we found a 1.1% increase.\n For respiratory mortality, the estimated effect was 0.9% for acute exposures, but 3.6% for the extended follow-up.\n We found each increase in current-day temperature by 1 degree C was associated with a 0.4% increase in total mortality, whereas each decrease of 1 degree C was associated with a 2.6% increase in mortality in the following 40 days.\n For both temperature and pollution, the largest effects on cardiovascular mortality were observed immediately, whereas respiratory mortality was delayed and distributed over several weeks.\n These effects were two to three times greater than the acute effects reported in other studies, and approach the effects reported in longer-term survival studies.\n This analysis suggests that studies on the acute effects of air pollution have underestimated the total effects of temperature and particulate air pollution on mortality.\n","id":"PMC1241827","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"NULL","authors":[{"firstname":"Patrick G","surname":"Goodman","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Douglas

Heat and Mortality in New York City: How Hot Is Too Hot?","abstract":"Background\nTo assess the public health risk of heat waves and to set criteria for alerts for excessive heat, various meteorologic metrics and models are used in different jurisdictions, generally without systematic comparisons of alternatives.\n\n We report such an analysis for New York City that compared maximum heat index with alternative metrics in models to predict daily variation in warm-season natural-cause mortality from 1997 through 2006.\nMaterials and methods\nWe used Poisson time-series generalized linear models and generalized additive models to estimate weather–mortality relationships using various metrics, lag and averaging times, and functional forms and compared model fit.\n\n\nResults\nA model that included cubic functions of maximum heat index on the same and each of the previous 3 days provided the best fit, better than models using maximum, minimum, or average temperature, or spatial synoptic classification (SSC) of weather type.\n\n We found that goodness of fit and maximum heat index–mortality functions were similar using parametric and nonparametric models.\n\n Same-day maximum heat index was linearly related to mortality risk across its range.\n\n The slopes at lags of 1, 2, and 3 days were flat across moderate values but increased sharply between maximum heat index of 95°F and 100°F (35–38°C).\n\n SSC or other meteorologic variables added to the maximum heat index model moderately improved goodness of fit, with slightly attenuated maximum heat index–mortality functions.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn New York City, maximum heat index performed similarly to alternative and more complex metrics in estimating mortality risk during hot weather.\n\n The linear relationship supports issuing heat alerts in New York City when the heat index is forecast to exceed approximately 95–100°F.\n\n Periodic city-specific analyses using recent data are recommended to evaluate public health risks from extreme heat.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2831972","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"National Institute of Environmental Health

associated with the elevated risks of mortality from, and outpatient visits for all causes and cardiopulmonary diseases during the cold seasons (November to April) from 2000 to 2008 in Northern, Central and Southern Taiwan.\n Eight cold-temperature indices, average, maximum, and minimum temperatures, and the temperature humidity index, wind chill index, apparent temperature, effective temperature (ET), and net effective temperature and their standardized Z scores were applied to distributed lag non-linear models.\n Index-specific cumulative 26-day (lag 0–25) mortality risk, cumulative 8-day (lag 0–7) outpatient visit risk, and their 95% confidence intervals were estimated at 1 and 2 standardized deviations below the median temperature, comparing with the Z score of the lowest risks for mortality and outpatient visits.\n The average temperature was adequate to evaluate the mortality risk from all causes and circulatory diseases.\n Excess all-cause mortality increased for 17–24% when average temperature was at Z = ? 1, and for 27–41% at Z = ? 2 among study areas.\n The cold-temperature indices were inconsistent in estimating risk of outpatient visits.\n Average temperature and THI were appropriate indices for measuring risk for all-cause outpatient visits.\n Relative risk of all-cause outpatient visits increased slightly by 2–7% when average temperature was at Z = ? 1, but no significant risk at Z = ? 2. Minimum temperature estimated the strongest risk associated with outpatient visits of respiratory diseases.\n In conclusion, the relationships between cold temperatures and health varied among study areas, types of health event, and the cold-temperature indices applied.\n Mortality from all causes and circulatory diseases and outpatient visits of respiratory diseases has a strong association with cold temperatures in the subtropical island, Taiwan.\n","id":"PMC7126292","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier B.V.","authors":[{"firstname":"Yu-Kai","surname":"Lin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yu-Chun","surname":"Wang","email":"ycwang@cycu.edu.tw","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pay-Liam","surname":"Lin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ming-Hsu","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tsung-Jung","surname":"Ho","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.01.090","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Temperature-mortality relationship in four subtropical Chinese cities: A time-series study using a distributed lag non-linear model","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1136/oem.2007.033175","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Temperature, temperature extremes, and mortality: A study of acclimatisation and effect modification in 50 US cities","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.3390/ijerph7083196","date":"2010-08-06","title":"Relation between Temperature and Mortality in Thirteen Spanish Cities","abstract":"In this study we examined the shape of the association between temperature and mortality in 13 Spanish cities representing a wide range of climatic and socio-demographic conditions.\n The temperature value linked with minimum mortality (MMT) and the slopes before and after the turning point (MMT) were calculated.\n Most cities showed a V-shaped temperature-mortality relationship.\n MMTs were generally higher in cities with warmer climates.\n Cold and heat effects also depended on climate: effects were greater in hotter cities but lesser in cities with higher variability.\n The effect of heat was greater than the effect of cold.\n The effect of cold and MMT was, in general, greater for cardio-respiratory mortality than for total mortality, while the effect of heat was, in general, greater among the elderly.\n","id":"PMC2954576","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Molecular Diversity Preservation International (MDPI)","authors":[{"firstname":"Carmen","surname":"Iñiguez","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ferran","surname":"Ballester","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Juan","surname":"Ferrandiz","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Santiago","surname":"Pérez-Hoyos","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Marc","surname":"Sáez","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Antonio","surname":"López","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1136/bmjopen-2015-009172","date":"2015-08-25","title":"Individual-level and community-level effect modifiers of the temperature–mortality relationship in 66 Chinese communities","abstract":"Objectives\nTo examine the modification of temperature-mortality association by factors at the individual and community levels.\n\n\nDesign and methods\nThis study investigated this issue using a national database comprising daily data of 66 Chinese communities for 2006–2011.

have been documented in developed countries, including North America and Europe.\n\n However, far fewer research reports are available from developing countries or specific cities in South Asia.\n\n In May 2010, Ahmedabad, India, faced a heat wave where the temperatures reached a high of 46.8°C with an apparent increase in mortality.\n\n The purpose of this study is to characterize the heat wave impact and assess the associated excess mortality.\n\n\nMethods\nWe conducted an analysis of all-cause mortality associated with a May 2010 heat wave in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India, to determine whether extreme heat leads to excess mortality.\n\n Counts of all-cause deaths from May 1–31, 2010 were compared with the mean of counts from temporally matched periods in May 2009 and 2011 to calculate excess mortality.\n\n Other analyses included a 7-day moving average, mortality rate ratio analysis, and relationship between daily maximum temperature and daily all-cause death counts over the entire year of 2010, using month-wise correlations.\n\n\nResults\nThe May 2010 heat wave was associated with significant excess all-cause mortality.\n\n 4,462 all-cause deaths occurred, comprising an excess of 1,344 all-cause deaths, an estimated 43.1% increase when compared to the reference period (3,118 deaths).\n\n In monthly pair-wise comparisons for 2010, we found high correlations between mortality and daily maximum temperature during the locally hottest “summer” months of April (r?=?0.69, p&lt;0.001), May (r?=?0.77, p&lt;0.001), and June (r?=?0.39, p&lt;0.05).\n\n During a period of more intense heat (May 19–25, 2010), mortality rate ratios were 1.76 [95% CI 1.67–1.83, p&lt;0.001] and 2.12 [95% CI 2.03–2.21] applying reference periods (May 12–18, 2010) from various

were defined considering both maximum apparent temperature and minimum temperature and classified by intensity, duration and timing during summer.\n\n The effect was estimated as percent increase in daily mortality during heat wave days compared to non heat wave days in people over 65 years.\n\n City specific and pooled estimates by gender, age and cause of death were calculated.\n\n\nResults\nThe effect of heat waves showed great geographical heterogeneity among cities.\n\n Considering all years, except 2003, the increase in mortality during heat wave days ranged from + 7.6% in Munich to + 33.6% in Milan.\n\n The increase was up to 3-times greater during episodes of long duration and high intensity.\n\n Pooled results showed a greater impact in Mediterranean

The first epidemic occurred during 2002-2003 in Guangdong province, China. The disease was termed 'severe acute respiratory syndrome' (SARS) and was caused by a newly identified coronavirus that was named SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). SARS-CoV infected 8000 individuals from several countries and resulted in 774 deaths. The second epidemic occurred in 2012 in the Middle East. This disease was termed 'Middle East respiratory syndrome' and was caused by a new virus called MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV). MERS-CoV infected 2494 individuals and resulted in around 860 deaths. At the end of 2019, a third epidemic occurred. This was caused by another new type of coronavirus designated by the World Health Organization as SARS-CoV-2. The resultant disease was named 'coronavirus disease' (COVID-19); the disease is now a worldwide pandemic.\nThe recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 was first identified in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province, China. The virus infects humans and a variety of animals, mainly pigs and bats. Infection results in a spectrum of clinical manifestations, which are mainly respiratory, ranging in severity from benign to lethal, and it is sometimes asymptomatic.\nIn an attempt to understand these epidemics, studies have examined factors that could influence the spread of coronaviruses. In general, three factors affect the epidemiology of communicable diseases: the agent of transmission, the host, and the environment.\nHistorically, the occurrences of SARS were partly associated with environmental factors. An ecological study conducted in China found that air pollution was associated with lethality in individuals affected by SARS. This was attributed to the fact that short- or long-term exposure to certain pollutants can compromise lung function. Another environmental factor was air temperature. identified, for the first time, that the incidence of SARS was 18 times higher at lower air temperatures than at higher temperatures. The authors reported that respiratory system diseases are more common in colder environments and that the virulence of agents deteriorates at higher climatic temperatures, as they may not be able to withstand the environmental changes. In addition, they pointed out that the transmissibility of SARS-CoV, in terms of climatic fluctuations, is similar to that of the influenza virus. Furthermore, the incidence of influenza increases significantly with low temperatures and high relative humidity, indicating that climatic factors can significantly affect viral transmission.\nIn the case of SARS-CoV-2, meteorological factors seem to influence the spread of the virus. identified that the speed of transmission was positively correlated with temperature and correlated with humidity. Thus, it is expected that if the temperature rises to 20  C, transmission rates increase by an average of 1.8 days. Regarding temperature and mortality rate, a study conducted in four Chinese cities found that colder temperatures had a greater effect on mortality. This is in contrast to the results of the study by, which showed that both cold and heat can adversely impact the mortality resulting from respiratory syndromes.\nOn the basis of the assumption that different climatic conditions play a significant role in the course of COVID-19, it is essential to identify associations between environmental factors, such as average, maximum, and minimum temperatures; precipitation; and demographic density, and SARS-CoV-2 transmission and COVID-19 mortality in humans.\nMethods\nData collection\nData for the period from December 1, 2019 to March 30, 2020 were collected. For meteorological variables, weather station data were extracted from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) database. Daily data from meteorological stations were segregated by country, and the following variables were recorded: precipitation, average temperature, maximum temperature, and minimum temperature (NOAA, 2020). Daily averages of each meteorological variable for the different countries were calculated. Finally, data on daily infection and death rates were extracted from World Health Organization reports (WHO, 2020).\nData summary.\nTable 1	 	\nVariable	Label	Range	Source	Measurement	 	Average temperature	TAVG	2019/12/01 to 2020/03/28	NOAA, 2020	Degrees Fahrenheit	 	Maximum temperature	TMAX	2019/12/01 to 2020/03/28	NOAA, 2020	Degrees Fahrenheit	 	Minimum Temperature	TMIN	2019/12/01 to 2020/03/30	NOAA, 2020	Degrees Fahrenheit	 	Precipitation	-	2019/12/01 to 2020/03/30	NOAA, 2020	Inches	 	Population density	-	2018	World Bank, 2020	Persons per km2	 	SARS-CoV-2 Infections	-	2019/12/01 to 2020/03/28	WHO, 2020	Number of Infections	 	SARS-CoV-2 Deaths	-	2019/12/01 to 2020/03/28	WHO, 2020	Number of Deaths	 	\nThe demographic density of each country was used as a control variable, with data obtained from the Food and Agriculture Organization and World Bank population estimates for the year 2018. The country's time of exposure to the epidemic was calculated from the temporal distance, in days, between the first case registered in the territory and the time of study. A summary of the variables is provided in Table 1 .\nModel\nTo analyze the association between the number of cases of and deaths from COVID-19 and climatic aspects, we used Eq. (1), as estimated by a panel data strategy: \nWhere Y it is the dependent variable (total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections or total number of deaths from COVID-19) for 249 countries &quot;i&quot; over the period &quot;t&quot; from December 1, 2019 to March 30, 2020; sigma is a constant; u i is the control for specific characteristics of the countries that are fixed over the analyzed period; and X it is a vector that includes all explanatory variables of the model, including the variable of interest, that is, the mean temperature.\nIn addition, we included other controls that may be related to the disease, such as average rainfall and the country's time of exposure to the epidemic. We included as binary variables D t, which captures specific effects associated with the months of January and February, and epsilon it, which is the error term of this equation that includes all factors that are associated with Y it and are not included in the equation.\nThe advantage of this strategy in relation to a traditional ordinary least squares estimate is that we can control for some country-specific factors that are fixed in time and associated with the number of deaths associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nData processing strategy\nTwo specific outcomes measures were considered. For the first, we analyzed the influence of climatic variables on SARS-CoV-2 infections, and for the second, we analyzed the influence of climatic variables on COVID-19 mortality.\nData processing strategy.\nFig. 1\nThree estimates were tested for each outcome and are shown in Fig. 1 . The first included only the average temperature; the second included the average temperature, minimum temperature, maximum temperature, precipitation, and the country's time of exposure to the epidemic; and the third included the average temperature, minimum temperature, maximum temperature, precipitation, the country's time of exposure to the epidemic, population density, and a variable to capture the specific month effects (complete specification).\nResults\nOutcome 1: Correlation between COVID-19 cases and climatic characteristics.\nTable 2	 	\n	Estimate 1	Estimate 2	Estimate 3	 	beta	Zd	beta	Zd	beta	Zd	 	TAVGa	-1.44***e	(-3.05)	-6.47***	(-2.69)	-6.40***	(-2.64)	 	TMAXb	-	-	3.71***	(2.45)	3.76***	(2.45)	 	TMINc	-	-	1.28	(0.88)	1.22	(0.79)	 	Precipitation	-	-	56.72***	(8.74)	56.01***	(8.74)	 	Exposure Time	-	-	15.51***	(32.17)	15.73***	(31.16)	 	Population Density	No	No	Yes	 	Dummy Month	No	No	Yes	 	Constant	-49.83	(-1.59)	15.51	(32.17)	15.73	(31.16)	 	Observations	18,066	9409	9409	 	\nAverage temperature.\nMaximum temperature.\nMinimum temperature.\nZ statistics in parentheses.\n* p &lt; .10, ** p &lt; .05, *** p &lt; .01.\n Table 2 shows the results of correlation analysis between the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and the average temperature by country. In the first estimated model, there is a negative correlation between the two variables. The significance of this relationship remains even after the inclusion of additional variables such as maximum and minimum temperatures (averages) and time of exposure to the disease. Even with the complete specification that includes two binary variables capturing specific effects for the months of the year and controlling for population density, the results suggest that an increase in temperature is associated with a decrease in the number of infections.\nThe coefficients shown in Table 2 cannot measure causality. There are several other factors that can affect the variable of interest, on which we do not have information, such as the number of beds and the patients' respective levels of social isolation. However, an association was observed between the climate and the number of COVID-19 cases. These models appear to be quite robust, particularly after the incorporation of controls such as additional climate variables and also month fixed effects.\nOutcome 2: Correlation between COVID-19 deaths and climatic characteristics.\nTable 3	 	\n	Estimate 1	Estimate 2	Estimate 3	 	beta	Zd	beta	Zd	beta	Zd	 	TAVGa	0.053***e	(2.07)	-0.10	(-0.68)	-0.10	(-0.67)	 	TMAXb	-	-	0.01	(0.18)	0.02	(0.30)	 	TMINc	-	-	0.01	0.12	0.001	(0.01)	 	Precipitation	-	-	0.34	(0.72)	0.33	(0.72)	 	Exposure Time	-	-	0.85***	(30.05)	0.86***	(29.12)	 	Population Density	No	No	Yes	 	Dummy Month	No	No	Yes	 	Constant	1.55	(0.90)	2.26	(1.25)	1.53	(0.80)	 	Observations	18,066	9409	9409	 	\nAverage temperature.\nMaximum temperature.\nMinimum temperature.\nZ statistics in parentheses.\n* p &lt; .10, ** p &lt; .05, *** p &lt; .01.\n Table 3 shows the results of correlation analysis between COVID-19 mortality and climatic variables. For this outcome measure, there were no significant associations between the coefficients and mortality or average temperature. It is possible that factors other than climate are related to mortality. In the first estimate, we evaluated only the relationship between COVID-19 mortality rates and the average temperature by country, which was significant. In the second estimate, we included the average, minimum, and maximum temperatures as well as the country's time of exposure to the disease and did not identify any significant association. In the last estimate, in addition to the controls already included in the previous specification, we also incorporated binary variables to capture any effects that were specific to this period. However, no significant correlation was identified between COVID-19 mortality rates and temperature.\nDiscussion\nSeveral factors can influence SAR-CoV-2 transmission, including environmental variables, population density, and medical care. This study aimed to identify the associations between environmental variables and SARS-CoV-2 transmission/COVID-19 mortality. A negative correlation was identified between temperature and the number infections.\nAlthough it is known that the influence of temperature on human health can vary between countries and even regions, the findings of this study are in agreement with the current literature in that temperature influences the transmission of viruses that cause respiratory syndromes, such as the influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2. By investigating the relationship between temperature and respiratory diseases, studies have indicated that SARS-CoV and the influenza virus survive only under certain climatic conditions and that their transmissibility is sensitive to rising temperatures, similar to the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2.\nThe influenza virus is more transmissible at lower temperatures because cold weather results in the weakening of host immunity, increasing susceptibility to infection. Considering that the transmissibility of coronaviruses is similar to that of the influenza virus, it can be assumed that these mechanisms also apply to the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.\nIn the model in which we considered only the average temperature, the observed correlation indicated that for every one degree Fahrenheit increase in temperature, there was a reduction in the number of infections by 1.44 cases/day. Under the composite model (estimate 3 of outcome measure 1), the association was stronger in that there was a decrease in the number of infections by 6.40 cases/day for each degree increase in temperature.\nThe second finding of this study was the significant association between mortality and average temperature, which was not maintained when other variables were added, indicating that non-climatic variables may be related to COVID-19 mortality. This finding differs from the findings of, who stated that temperature and COVID-19 mortality are negatively associated. One possible reason for the conflicting results is the limited geographical scope of the study by Ma et al., which focused only on China and its climate. Our study included data from a range of countries and climatic regions.\nEnvironmental factors that influence the relationship between temperature and mortality, such as latitude; humidity; air pollution; and sociodemographic factors, such as age, sex, and income, have been reported. reported that people who live at low latitudes have a relatively weak adaptive capacity to cold and a strong adaptive capacity to heat, and the reverse has also been shown. High humidity, which is associated with low temperatures, is an important factor in the transmissibility of the influenza virus, either by conserving virulence or weakening the host by cooling the body or drying the respiratory tract.\nA study reported that temperature and humidity are associated with a higher risk of COVID-19. Therefore, although humidity was not considered in our research because of the lack of information on this variable from some meteorological stations, precipitation seems to be an important factor that must be considered. We found that there was a positive correlation between precipitation and SARS-CoV-2 transmission, showing that for each 1-in. increase in precipitation/day, there was an increase of 56.01 cases/day.\nAnother result concerns the country's time of exposure to SARS-CoV-2. As expected, this variable also showed a positive correlation, showing that for each additional day of exposure there was an average increase of 15.73 cases/day. This finding is consistent with the behavioral evidence on SARS-CoV-2 transmission, that is, after community infection, transmission follows the same geometric progression.\nIt is important to mention that our study only interpreted the significance of the coefficients and not their magnitude because of the probable existence of endogeneity in the estimated relationships, considering that a series of regressors are associated with temperature and disease mortality at the same time.\nConclusion\nThis is the first global study covering all countries affected by COVID-19. We examined the associations between climatic variables and SARS-CoV-2 transmission and COVID-19 mortality. The findings showed a negative correlation between a country's average temperature and the number of COVID-19 cases, the absence of a correlation between mortality and the average temperature, and a positive correlation between the country's time of exposure to the virus and the number of cases. In addition, this study reported that precipitation as an important factor in the transmissibility of the virus.\nThis research provides important information that can inform the decisions of local and global health authorities. As climatic variations are associated with the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, new policies to reinforce health systems or social isolation methods can be adopted, depending on temperature and precipitation patterns.\nAs a limitation, we highlight the absence of humidity data, in view of its important role in the virulence of respiratory syndromes. However, because of the current data restrictions, this factor could not be considered, and it should be included in future studies. We also suggest that future studies focus on micro-regions to capture temperature patterns and include variables related to solar radiation.\nAbbreviations\nCOVID-19\nCorona Virus Disease 2019\nOLS\nOrdinary Least Squares\nTAVG\nAverage Temperature\nTMAX\nMaximum Temperature\nTMIN\nMinimum Temperature\nNOAA\nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\nWHO\nWorld Health Organization\nEthical approval and consent to participate\nNot applicable.\nAvailability of supporting data\nClimate Data: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration website.\nCOVID-19 Data: World Health Organization website.\nDemographic Data: World Bank website.\nFunding\nNot applicable.\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n Marcos Felipe Falcao Sobral: Conceptualization, Writing - review &amp; editing, Methodology, Data curation.

and 1.10 (95% CI: 0.97–1.26), respectively.\n\n\nConclusion\nInfluenza epidemics are associated with a rise in autopsy-confirmed coronary deaths.\n\n Influenza vaccination should be advocated for patients at high risk of developing cardiovascular events.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7108465","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"The University of Chicago

meteorological factors and air pollution on the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome","abstract":"Objectives\nTo understand the association between the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and meteorological factors and air pollution.\n\n\nStudy design\nAn ecological study was conducted.\n\n\nMethods\nThree hundred and fifty primary probable SARS cases diagnosed in mainland China between 1 January and 31 May 2003, and their 6727 close contacts during the period of their clinical symptoms before admission, were included in this study.\n\n Of the 6727 close contacts, 135 (2.0%) later developed clinical symptoms and were diagnosed as probable SARS cases.\n\n The daily meteorological data and daily air pollution data during the same SARS outbreak period in mainland China were used in the data analysis.\n\n Logistic regression analyses were conducted to explore the association between the secondary attack rate of SARS and meteorological factors and air pollution.\n\n\nResults\nIn univariate analyses, daily average temperature (DAT), daily average air pressure (DAAP), and daily average relative humidity (DARH) were inversely associated with secondary attack rate (P&lt;0.001); a significant positive association was found for daily hours of sunshine (DHS) (P&lt;0.001).\n\n In multivariate analyses, factors associated with secondary attack rate were DAAP (odds ratio (OR)=0.53, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.42, 0.66), DARH (OR=0.73, 95% CI: 0.53, 1.00), and daily average wind velocity (DAWV; OR=0.81, 95% CI: 0.68, 0.96).\n\n Adjustment for the onset time of a primary case led to little change in the results.\n\n In addition, in Hebei Province, a major affected area in China, only DAWV (OR=0.38, 95% CI: 0.20, 0.72) was a significant predictor of secondary attack rate with adjustment for the onset time of primary case.\n\n In Inner Mongolia, another major affected area in China, DAWV (OR=0.50, 95% CI: 0.26, 0.94) and DHS (OR=0.27, 95% CI: 0.09, 0.81) were significant predictors of secondary attack rate with adjustment for the onset time of primary case.\n\n\nConclusions\nOur results suggest that the SARS outbreak was significantly associated with DAWV, and that DAAP, DARH and DHS may also have influenced the SARS outbreak to some extent.\n\n However, because of ecological fallacy and uncontrolled confounding effects that may have biased the results, the association between the SARS outbreak and these meteorological factors and air pollution deserve further investigation.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7118752","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"The Royal Institute of Public Health.

We conducted a retrospective study relating daily pneumonia and influenza mortality for New York City and surroundings from 1975–2002 to daily air temperature, dew point temperature (a measure of atmospheric humidity), and daily air mass type.\n We identified high mortality days and periods and employed temporal smoothers and lags to account for the latency period and the time between

Humidity and Influenza A Viability in Droplets and Implications for Influenza’s Seasonality","abstract":"Humidity has been associated with influenza’s seasonality, but the mechanisms underlying the relationship remain unclear.\n There is no consistent explanation for influenza’s transmission patterns that applies to both temperate and tropical regions.\n This study aimed to determine the relationship between ambient humidity and viability of the influenza A virus (IAV) during transmission between hosts and to explain the mechanisms underlying it.\n We measured the viability of IAV in droplets consisting of various model media, chosen to isolate effects of salts and proteins found in respiratory fluid, and in human mucus, at relative humidities (RH) ranging from 17% to 100%.\n In all media and mucus, viability was highest when RH was either close to 100% or below ?50%.\n When RH decreased from 84% to 50%, the relationship between viability and RH depended on droplet composition: viability decreased in saline solutions, did not change significantly in solutions supplemented with proteins, and increased dramatically in mucus.\n Additionally, viral decay increased linearly with salt concentration in saline solutions but not when they were supplemented with proteins.\n There appear to be three regimes of IAV viability in droplets, defined by humidity: physiological conditions (?100% RH) with high viability, concentrated conditions (50% to near 100% RH) with lower viability depending on the composition of media, and dry conditions (&lt;50% RH) with high viability.\n This paradigm could help resolve conflicting findings in the literature on the relationship between IAV viability in aerosols and humidity, and results in human mucus could help explain influenza’s seasonality in different regions.\n","id":"PMC3463543","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

other factors on the inactivation of viruses in different environmental media.\n\n\nMethods\nWe systematically review available information on the environmental inactivation of influenza A viruses and employ information on infectious dose and results from mathematical models to assess transmission modes.\n\n\nResults\nDaily inactivation rate constants differ by several orders of magnitude: on inanimate surfaces and in aerosols daily inactivation rates are in the order of 1–102, on hands in the order of 103.\n\n Influenza virus can survive in aerosols for several hours, on hands for a few minutes.\n\n Nasal infectious dose of influenza A is several orders of magnitude larger than airborne infectious dose.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe airborne route is a potentially important transmission pathway for influenza in indoor environments.\n\n The importance of droplet transmission has to be reassessed.\n\n Contact transmission can be limited by fast inactivation of influenza virus on hands and is more so than airborne transmission dependent on behavioral parameters.\n\n However, the potentially large inocula deposited in the environment through sneezing and the protective effect of nasal mucus on virus survival could make contact transmission a key transmission mode.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7112701","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"The British Infection Society.

influenza virus survival in grade schools","abstract":"Background\nLow absolute humidity (AH) has been associated with increased influenza virus survival and transmissibility and the onset of seasonal influenza outbreaks.\n\n Humidification of indoor environments may mitigate viral transmission and may be an important control strategy, particularly in schools where viral transmission is common and contributes to the spread of influenza in communities.\n\n However, the variability and predictors of AH in the indoor school environment and the feasibility of classroom humidification to levels that could decrease viral survival have not been studied.\n\n\nMethods\nAutomated sensors were used to measure temperature, humidity and CO2 levels in two Minnesota grade schools without central humidification during two successive winters.\n\n Outdoor AH measurements were derived from the North American Land Data Assimilation System.\n\n Variability in indoor AH within classrooms, between classrooms in the same school, and between schools was assessed using concordance correlation coefficients (CCC).\n\n Predictors of indoor AH were examined using time-series Auto-Regressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity models.\n\n Classroom humidifiers were used when school was not in session to assess the feasibility of increasing indoor AH to levels associated with decreased influenza virus survival, as projected from previously published animal experiments.\n\n\nResults\nAH varied little within classrooms (CCC &gt;0.90) but was more variable between classrooms in the same school (CCC 0.81 for School 1, 0.88 for School 2) and between schools (CCC 0.81).\n\n Indoor AH varied widely during the winter (range 2.60 to 10.34 millibars [mb]) and was strongly associated with changes in outdoor AH (p?&lt;?0.001).\n\n Changes in indoor AH on school weekdays were strongly associated with CO2 levels (p?&lt;?0.001).\n\n Over 4 hours, classroom humidifiers increased indoor AH by 4 mb, an increase sufficient to decrease projected 1-hour virus survival by an absolute value of 30% during winter months.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring winter, indoor AH in non-humidified grade schools varies substantially and often to levels that are very low.\n\n Indoor results are predicted by outdoor AH over a season and CO2 levels (which likely reflects human activity) during individual school days.\n\n Classroom humidification may be a feasible approach to increase indoor AH to levels that may decrease influenza virus survival and transmission.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3568414","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Tyler

about explanations resting solely on cold air or low humidity.\n Seasonal variation in host physiology may also contribute.\n Newly emergent zoonotic diseases such as ebola or pandemic strains of

Weather Conditions and Social Contact Patterns Relevant to Influenza Transmission","abstract":"Although there is no doubt that significant morbidity and mortality occur during annual influenza epidemics, the role of contextual circumstances, which catalyze seasonal influenza transmission, remains unclear.\n Weather conditions are believed to affect virus survival, efficiency of transmission and host immunity, but seasonality may also be driven by a tendency of people to congregate indoors during periods of bad weather.\n To test this hypothesis, we combined data from a social contact survey in Belgium with local weather data.\n In the absence of a previous in-depth weather impact analysis of social contact patterns, we explored the possibilities and identified pitfalls.\n We found general dominance of day-type (weekend, holiday, working day) over weather conditions, but nonetheless observed an increase in long duration contacts (1 hour) on regular workdays with low temperatures, almost no precipitation and low absolute humidity of the air.\n Interestingly, these conditions are often assumed to be beneficial for virus survival and transmission.\n Further research is needed to establish the impact of the weather on social contacts.\n We recommend that future studies sample over a broad spectrum of weather conditions and day types and include a sufficiently large proportion of holiday periods and weekends.\n","id":"PMC3498265","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

2003 SARS epidemic","abstract":"Since the emergence of HIV/AIDS in the 1980s, social scientists and sociologists of health and illness have been exploring the metaphorical framing of this infectious disease in its social context.\n Many have focused on the militaristic language used to report and explain this illness, a type of language that has permeated discourses of immunology, bacteriology and infection for at least a century.\n In this article, we examine how language and metaphor were used in the UK media's coverage of another previously unknown and severe infectious disease: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).\n SARS offers an opportunity to explore the cultural framing of a less extraordinary epidemic disease.\n It therefore provides an analytical counter-weight to the very extensive body of interpretation that has developed around HIV/AIDS.\n By analysing the total reporting on SARS of five major national newspapers during the epidemic of spring 2003, we investigate how the reporting of SARS in the UK press was framed, and how this related to media, public and governmental responses to the disease.\n We found that, surprisingly, militaristic language was largely absent, as was the judgemental discourse of plague.\n Rather, the main conceptual metaphor used was SARS as a killer.\n SARS as a killer was a single unified entity, not an army or force.\n We provide some tentative explanations for this shift in linguistic framing by relating it to local political concerns, media cultures, and spatial factors.\n","id":"PMC7117051","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China5.\n This outbreak highlights the ongoing ability of viral spill-over from animals to cause severe disease in humans.\n","id":"PMC7094943","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing Group

China, especially at the multi-large city level.\n This study was based on the data of seven typical, large Chinese cities to examine temperature-mortality relationships and optimum temperature of China.\n A generalized additive model (GAM) was applied to analyze the acute-effect of temperature on non-accidental mortality, and meta-analysis was used to merge data.\n Furthermore, the lagged effects of temperature up to 40 days on mortality and optimum temperature were analyzed using the distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM).\n We found that for all non-accidental mortality, high temperature could significantly increase the excess risk (ER) of death by 0.33% (95% confidence interval: 0.11%, 0.56%) with the temperature increase of 1 °C.\n Similar but non-significant ER of death was observed when temperature decreased.\n The lagged effect of temperature showed that the relative risk of non-accidental mortality was lowest at 21 °C.\n Our research suggests that high temperatures are more likely to cause an acute increase in mortality.\n There was a lagged effect of temperature on mortality, with an optimum temperature of 21 °C.\n Our results could provide a

Dynamic tracking of variant frequencies revealed a recurrent pattern of G614 increase at multiple geographic levels: national, regional, and municipal.\n The shift occurred even in local epidemics where the original D614 form was well established prior to introduction of the G614 variant.\n The consistency of this pattern was highly statistically significant, suggesting that the G614 variant may have a fitness advantage.\n We found that the G614 variant grows to a higher titer as pseudotyped virions.\n In infected individuals, G614 is associated with lower RT-PCR cycle thresholds, suggestive of higher upper respiratory tract viral loads, but not with increased disease severity.\n These findings illuminate changes important for a mechanistic understanding of the virus and

neutralization resistance and disease severity.\n Here we report the emergence of the PANGO lineage C.\n1.2, detected at low prevalence in South Africa and eleven other countries.\n The initial C.\n1.2 detection is associated with a high substitution rate, and includes changes within the spike protein that have been associated with increased transmissibility or reduced neutralization sensitivity in SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern or variants of interest.\n Like Beta and Delta, C.\n1.2 shows significantly reduced neutralization sensitivity to plasma from vaccinees and individuals infected with the ancestral D614G virus.\n In contrast, convalescent donors infected with either Beta or Delta show high plasma neutralization against C.\n1.2.

have affected people in lower socioeconomic groups worse than the affluent.\n\n The SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and the specificity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests in South Africa is not known.\n\n\nMethods\nWe tested 405 volunteers representing all socioeconomic strata from the workforce of a popular shopping and tourist complex in central Cape Town with the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay.\n\n We assessed the association between antibody positivity and COVID-19 symptom status, medical history, and sociodemographic variables.\n\n We tested 137 serum samples from healthy controls collected in Cape Town prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, to confirm the specificity of the assay in the local population.\n\n\nResults\nOf the 405 volunteers tested one month after the first peak of the epidemic in Cape Town, 96(23.7%) were SARS-CoV-2 IgG positive.\n\n Of those who tested positive, 46(47.9%) reported no symptoms of COVID-19 in the previous 6 months.\n\n Seropositivity was significantly associated with living in informal housing, residing in a subdistrict with low income-per household, and having a low-earning occupation.\n\n The specificity of the assay was 98.54%(95%CI 94.82%-99.82%) in the pre-COVID controls.\n\n\nConclusions\nThere is a high background seroprevalence in Cape Town, particularly in people of lower socioeconomic status.\n\n Almost half of cases are asymptomatic, and therefore undiagnosed by local testing strategies.\n\n These results cannot be explained by low assay

Safety was also assessed.\n\n\nResults\nThe per-protocol population included 19,630 SARS-CoV-2–negative participants who received Ad26.COV2.S and 19,691 who received placebo.\n\n Ad26.COV2.S protected against moderate to severe–critical Covid-19 with onset at least 14 days after administration (116 cases in the vaccine group vs.\n\n 348 in the placebo group; efficacy, 66.9%; adjusted 95% confidence interval [CI], 59.0 to 73.4) and at least 28 days after administration (66 vs.\n\n 193 cases; efficacy, 66.1%; adjusted 95% CI, 55.0 to 74.8).\n\n Vaccine efficacy was higher against severe–critical Covid-19 (76.7% [adjusted 95% CI, 54.6 to 89.1] for onset at ?14 days and 85.4% [adjusted 95% CI, 54.2 to 96.9] for onset at ?28 days).\n\n Despite 86 of 91 cases (94.5%) in South Africa with sequenced virus having the 20H/501Y.\n\nV2 variant, vaccine efficacy was 52.0% and 64.0% against moderate to severe–critical Covid-19 with onset at least 14 days and at least 28 days after administration, respectively, and efficacy against severe–critical Covid-19 was 73.1% and 81.7%, respectively.\n\n Reactogenicity was higher with Ad26.COV2.S than with placebo but was generally mild to moderate and transient.\n\n The incidence of serious adverse events was balanced between the two groups.\n\n Three deaths occurred in the vaccine group (none were Covid-19–related), and 16 in the placebo group (5 were Covid-19–related).\n\n\nConclusions\nA single dose of Ad26.COV2.S protected against symptomatic Covid-19 and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and was effective against severe–critical disease, including hospitalization and death.\n\n Safety appeared to be similar to that in other phase 3 trials of Covid-19 vaccines.\n\n (Funded by Janssen Research and Development and others;

The initial outbreak of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 in China in 2019 has been severely tested in other countries worldwide. As of April 6, 2020, COVID-19 had infected 1,345,048 patients in 184 countries/regions and caused 74,565 deaths, as countries worldwide responded to a human-to-human respiratory disease pandemic caused by COVID-19. Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs), such as SARS and COVID-19, pose a vast economic and public health burden worldwide.\nCOVID-19 not only seriously endangers people's life safety and health but also greatly affects economic globalization. To address the challenges posed by COVID-19, the links among the transmission of COVID-19, socio-economic factors and climatic factors must be understood to suggest better strategies for predicting, preventing, coping with and mitigating the associated challenges. Simultaneously, given that the climate and socio-economic context are unlikely to change in the short term, it is easier to intervene accordingly. The spread of many EIDs has been reported to be influenced by socio-ecological factors, including socio-economic and climate factors. Previous studies have found that climatic conditions limit the geographical and seasonal distribution of EIDs, and weather affects the timing and intensity of outbreaks. In addition, whereas climate patterns may control the potential global distribution of EIDs, the actual size and spatial scope of a region may be controlled by several non-climatic factors associated with transmission, including epidemiological, socio-economic and demographic factors. However, research on the climatic and socio-economic drivers of COVID-19 transmission remains lacking especially regarding the effects of socio-economic factors and the total effects of socio-ecological factors. Ignoring important non-climatic factors or other confounding factors (such as urban development, economic growth, poverty, health, infrastructure, science and technology, social security and labor) would overestimate the effects of climate change. Therefore, studying the influence of socio-ecological factors on the transmission risk of EIDs is highly important.\nFor most EIDs, three elements are essential: an agent (or pathogen), a host (or vector) and the environment of transmission. Appropriate climatic and weather conditions are necessary for the survival, reproduction, distribution and transmission of disease pathogens, vectors and hosts. Therefore, changes in climate or weather conditions may affect EIDs by affecting pathogens, vectors, hosts and their living environments. Although many climate variables may influence the transmission of EIDs, some studies have shown that changes in the four main variables have the greatest effects on infected diseases with strong environmental components (temperature, precipitation, relative humidity (RH) and wind). In recent studies, although the severity of some cases of COVID-19 has mimicked that of SARS-CoV cases, the reproductive number (average R0=3.28) of COVID-19 is higher than that of SARS-CoV; therefore, considering the climate and environment may improve understanding of the pathogen's vectorial capacity and basic reproduction number, and the risk of transmission of COVID-19.\nIn recent decades, many rapid and pronounced changes in human social ecology have altered the likelihood of the emergence and spread of infectious diseases. These changes include increases in population size and density; urbanization; persistent poverty (especially in the expansion of urban slums); the number and movement of political, economic and environmental refugees; differences in infrastructure and science and technology; and poor health awareness. The socio-economic environment contributes significantly to the health of individuals as well as communities and is the root cause of health and health equity. These socio-economic drivers have contributed to the shifting global ecology of vector transmission that enabled COVID-19 to emerge worldwide, by dangerously uniting the human hosts, vectors and pathogen. Socioeconomic changes interact with environmental changes in promoting EID spread and increase the harm of EIDs to humans.\nThe purpose of this study was to describe the spatial distribution of the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide, and assess the effects of different socio-ecological factors, including climate and socio-economic factors, on COVID-19 risk in 178 countries/regions worldwide, including incidence rate (IR), cumulative mortality rate (CMR) and daily cumulative index (DCI). In addition, this study analyzed intervention policies in different countries and regions to establish early warning and decision support systems and provide guidance for COVID-19 management in different countries/regions.\nMethods\nConcept model\nAccording to previous research, we established the Potential Risk Assessment Framework for COVID-19 (Figure 1). The influence of global socio-ecological factors (climate and socio-economic factors) on the risk of COVID-19 can be tested by its influence on the following three disease components: agent (or pathogen), host (or vector) and the environment of transmission. A combination of natural and human influences led to the COVID-19 pandemic. We used three main variables to assess the potential risk of COVID-19: IR, CMR and DCI.\nDefinitions of different cases for COVID-19\nA confirmed case of COVID-19 infection was defined by laboratory confirmation of the virus causing COVID-19 infection, regardless of clinical signs and symptoms. However, some reported case numbers from China have included people with symptoms of COVID-19 without laboratory confirmation. The definitions of COVID-19 related deaths differ across countries. In Italy, any death of a person with positive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2 is considered COVID-19 related.\nData collection\nOutcome variables\nA dashboard published and hosted by researchers at the Center for Systems Science and Engineering, Johns Hopkins University (JHU-CSSE) shows the numbers and locations of confirmed COVID-19 cases, deaths and recoveries in all affected countries. All collected data on COVID-19 from the Johns Hopkins University are made freely available by the researchers through a GitHub repository. All manual updates (for countries and regions outside mainland China) are coordinated by a team at Johns Hopkins University. We extracted the global time series data of confirmed and recovered cases and deaths due to COVID-19 from the JHU-CSSE GitHub repository. The data were recorded from January 22, 2020 and were updated once daily around 23:59 (UTC). We selected the cross-sectional data from April 6, 2020. On the basis of the availability of the data, we extracted 178 countries from the database (excluding countries/regions without COVID-19 cases and some unmatched countries/regions, such as Taiwan, China). The first-level geographical unit of the dataset is the country/region, and the second-level geographical unit is the province/state. We uniformly selected first-level geographical units (countries/regions). In addition, we further classified the countries/regions in the data set according to UN geographical divisions and divided the countries with epidemic COVID-19 into 20 regions. As previously mentioned, for outcome variables, we selected IR, CMR and DCI as indicators to measure COVID-19 risk. The specific calculation process is shown in Table 1.\nIR was used to describe the distribution of COVID-19, explore the etiological factors, propose an etiological hypothesis, and evaluate the efficacy of detection and prevention measures. CMR reflects the total deaths due to COVID-19 and is an indicator of the risk of death from COVID-19. DCI mainly describes the growth rate of COVID-19 in different countries/regions and is a measure of the risk of disease transmission. The World Health Organization, on March 11, 2020, declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic, thus indicating that COVID-19 had broadly spread worldwide. Therefore, when we considered IR, CMR and DCI in different countries/regions, these measures reflected not only the rapid growth in the number of people infected with COVID-19 but also the detection level in the entire country/region, which was used to identify more people infected with COVID-19.\nClimate data\nWe obtained daily meteorological observation values from the Global Surface Summary of the Day (GSOD) via The Integrated Surface Hourly (ISH) dataset. The ISH dataset includes global data obtained from the USAF Climatology Center, which is located in the Federal Climate Complex with NCDC. GSOD comprises 12 daily averages computed from global hourly station data. Except in United States stations, 24-hour periods are based on UTC times. The latest daily summary data are normally available 1-2 days after the date-time of the observations used in the daily summaries. More than 9,000 stations' data worldwide are typically available. Daily weather elements include mean values of temperature, dew point temperature, sea level pressure, station pressure, visibility, wind speed, maximum and minimum temperature, maximum sustained wind speed and maximum gust, precipitation amount, snow depth and weather indicators. However, we chose the climate data from April 6, 2020 and selected four variables from the GSOD dataset that significantly affected COVID-19 risk: (1) mean temperature (.1 Fahrenheit); (2) mean dew point (.1 Fahrenheit); (3) mean wind speed (.1 knots); and (4) precipitation amount (.01 inches). The reason for extracting the average dew point variable was to calculate the RH value by using this variable and the temperature variable. The temperature and dew point in Celsius were used to calculate the RH according to the temperature and dew point at each time point:   where C is the temperature in Celsius, F is the temperature in Celsius, D is the mean dew point for the day in Celsius, T is the mean temperature for the day in Celsius, and e is the base of the natural log.\nSocio-economic data\nIndicators of socio-economic factors affecting the spread of COVID-19 were derived from the World Development Indicators dataset, the primary World Bank collection of development indicators, which compiles relevant, high-quality and internationally comparable statistics about global development and the fight against poverty. The database contains 1,600 time series indicators for 217 economies and more than 40 country groups, and data for many indicators cover a period of more than 50 years. As shown in Table 2, we selected 32 indicators affecting COVID-19 risk in seven dimensions in 178 countries/regions. The index value for 2019 was taken as the priority for each indicator. If the index was missing in 2019, the index value of the most recent year was selected as a substitute.\nStatistical analysis\nSpatial econometrics method\nFirst, we used Moran's I to measure the global correlation of COVID-19 risk indicators. Global Moran's I is a measure of global spatial autocorrelation, and the value of Moran's I usually ranges from -1 to +1. Values significantly below -1/(N-1) indicate negative spatial autocorrelation, and values significantly above -1/(N-1) indicate positive spatial autocorrelation. If significant global spatial autocorrelation was found, we then used local indicators of spatial autocorrelation (LISA) to evaluate the locations of COVID-19 clusters. The meaning of local Moran's Ii is similar to that of global Moran's I. A positive Ii indicates that the high (or low) value of region i is surrounded by the surrounding high (or low) value; A negative Ii indicates that the high (or low) value of region i is surrounded by the surrounding low (or high) value. The general models are described in Eq. 1-2.   where n is the number of spatial units indexed by i and j, x is the variable of social ecology factors,  is the mean of x, and wij is a matrix of spatial weights with zeroes on a diagonal (i.e., Wii =0).\nSecond, to better approximate the real infectious disease spatial spread process, we fit a one-order spatial autoregressive regression model comprising spatial lags. Because we believed that COVID-19 risk transmission in a certain country/region would be different for neighboring countries/regions, we sought to reflect this difference in the model. A one-order spatial autoregressive process takes the form (Eq. 3):  where delta is the spatial autoregressive coefficient, W is the i, j -th element of the exogenous, non-negative N x N spatial weight matrix with zero diagonal elements that describes the arrangement of the spatial units in the countries/regions, and epsilon is i.i.d. innovations with zero mean and finite variance sigma2. For simplicity, in this paper, we assumed that the spatial weight matrix W was non-standardized and also used a queen spatial weight matrix.\nProcessing of missing values\nBefore negative binominal regression, the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) approach was used to impute missing data for some socio-ecological variables. For a given patient with missing values, the k-NN method identifies the k-nearest countries/regions on the basis of Euclidean distance. Using these countries/regions, we then replaced missing values by using a majority vote for discrete variables and weighted means for continuous features. One advantage of using this method is that missing values in all features are imputed simultaneously without the need to treat features individually.\nNegative binomial regression\nFirst, we established the correlation matrix of socio-economic factors to check for multicollinearity. If there was a strong correlation (&gt; 0.8) among socio-economic factors, then we removed the factor with strong correlation with other variables. Then, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) of each socio-ecological factor was calculated with single factor negative binomial regression analysis, that is, the effect of each socio-ecological factor on COVID-19 risk by changing the average COVID-19 risk value by a specific unit quantity. The spatial autoregressive models comprising spatial lags, which were a weighted average of observations on the diseases over neighboring units, were input into the model to adjust for spatial variation in COVID-19 risk. Modeled values of climate factors were centered on the mean values for each station in every country/region. The factors with P &lt; 0.05 were included in the multi-factor negative binomial regression analysis with spatial information to calculate the adjusted IRR (aIRR). The general model is described in Eq. 4.  where yi denotes the daily counts of COVID-19 risk indicators in county/region i ; WY represents spatial lags, and W is the spatial weight; Sn represents socio-economic factors (all variables are in Table 2); Tt is the mean temperature in county/region i; Ht is the RH in county/region i; Mt is the wind speed in county/region i; Pt is the precipitation amount in county/region i; and epsiloni is a random intercept.\nSensitivity analyses with maximum and minimum temperatures instead of average temperatures were also conducted with the same procedures, in which we used the same non-informative priors for the minimum and maximum temperatures. All statistical analyses were performed in Stata statistical software Version 15, and p-values were two-tailed, with statistical significance set at.05. ArcMap 10.7 and Geoda software were used to process basic geographic information. Data visualization mainly used RStudio software Version 1.2.5033.\nResults\nCharacteristics of 178 countries/regions with reported cases of COVID-19\nAs of April 6, 2020, a total of 178 countries/regions worldwide had reported data and were included in this study (Table S1). The three countries/regions with the highest IR worldwide were Andorra (Southern Europe, IR=313.80), Iceland (Northern Europe, IR=215.90) and Gibraltar (United Kingdom) (Southern Europe, IR=178.52). The three countries/regions with the highest CMR worldwide were San Marino (Southern Europe, CMR=947.17), Spain (Southern Europe, IR=285.53) and Italy (Southern Europe, IR=273.42). The three countries/regions with the highest DCI worldwide were the United States (North America, DCI=4823.87), Spain (Southern Europe, DCI=2070.83) and Italy (Southern Europe, DCI=1978.31).\nSpatial clustering evaluation for COVID-19\nTest results for global spatial correlation\nThe number and distribution of first-order neighbors in different countries/regions are shown in Figure 2. The number of neighboring countries/regions was mainly concentrated in 0-6, accounting for 87.08% of the total number of neighboring countries. Among them, China and Russia had the largest number of neighboring countries/regions.\nTable S2 shows the global spatial Moran's I indexes of the IR, CMR and DCI of 178 countries/regions worldwide according to the one-order spatial contiguity matrix. The Moran's I indexes of IR, CMR and DCI were all positive, and all index values were significant at the level of 1%, thus indicating that the IR, CMR and DCI of 178 countries/regions worldwide had strong spatial aggregation effects. Meanwhile, the Moran's I index of different indicators showed significant differences, thus indicating to some extent that IR, CMR and DCI have different aggregation effects in different countries/regions.\nTest results for local spatial correlation\nA total of 37 countries/regions were strongly opposite from the IR index &quot;spatial autocorrelation hypothesis,&quot; including 11 countries/regions with high-high patterns, mainly concentrated in Western Europe, southern Europe and Canada; 24 countries/regions with low-low patterns, mainly concentrated in parts of Africa, parts of Asia (China, India, Laos); Cuba with a low-high pattern; and Djibouti with a high-low pattern. Simultaneously, 29 countries/regions were strongly opposite from the CMR index &quot;spatial autocorrelation hypothesis,&quot; which was suitable for 10 countries with high-high patterns, mainly in Western Europe and southern Europe (e.g., France, Italy and Spain); 16 countries/regions with low-low patterns, mainly concentrated in parts of Africa and China; and three countries with low-high patterns, including Morocco and Slovenia. In addition, 39 countries/regions strongly did not support the hypothesis of &quot;no spatial autocorrelation&quot; of the DCI index, among which six countries/regions had high-high patterns (Canada, France, Portugal, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Switzerland), and 22 countries/regions had low-low patterns, mainly in parts of Africa and Honduras. Eleven countries were in the low-high pattern category, including Mexico, Cuba, Morocco, Denmark and Luxembourg, etc. The above results are consistent with the global spatial autocorrelation test results, thus indicating that IR, CMR and DCI indicators in some countries/regions may be affected by the COVID-19 epidemic in neighboring countries/regions and may show clear geographical characteristics.\nTo directly reflect the local spatial characteristics of IR, CMR and DCI, LISA scatter diagrams of the three indexes are shown in Figure 3. Most of the three indicators fell into the third quadrant (low-low), but the countries/regions whose IR and DCI index fell into the first quadrant (high-high) and the second quadrant (low-high) had indicator values exceeding the CMR. Thus, among the 178 countries/regions worldwide, the countries/regions with low IR, CMR and DCI indicators showed a spatial agglomeration effect, as did the countries/regions with high IR, CMR and DCI indicators. In addition, some neighboring countries/regions showed some differences in IR, CMR and DCI (high-low and low-high).\nAnalysis of the influence of socio-ecological factors on COVID-19 risk\nCorrelation analysis of socio-economic factors\nTo eliminate the influence of the collinearity between the socio-economic indicators on the estimation effect of the model, we established a correlation matrix of the socio-economic indicators (Table S3). The indexes with strong correlation (&gt; 0.8) were screened, and one of the effective indexes was reserved for model analysis. We excluded eight socio-economic indicators in Table 2, numbered 7 (current health expenditure per capita), 12 (total life expectancy at birth), 13 (maternal mortality ratio), 14 (infant mortality rate), 17 (access to basic handwashing facilities including soap and water), 20 (population growth), 21 (proportion of the population spending more than 10% of household consumption or income on out-of-pocket health care expenditure) and 26 (technicians in R&amp;D), and we retained 20 socio-economic indicators.\nNegative binomial regression analysis of socio-ecological factors on COVID-19 risk\nWe analyzed the effects of socio-ecological factors on COVID-19 risk in 178 countries. The results of single-factor and multi-factor negative binomial regression analysis are shown in Table 4.\nThe IR was significantly positively associated with GDP per capita (aIRR=1.029, 95%CI: 1.013-1.045), use of at least basic sanitation services (aIRR=1.022, 95%CI: 1.005-1.039) and coverage of social insurance programs (aIRR=1.047, 95%CI: 1.009-1.086), and was significantly negatively associated with the proportion of the population spending more than 25% of household consumption or income on out-of-pocket health care expenses (aIRR=0.846, 95%CI: 0.750-0.955) and the poverty headcount ratio at national poverty lines (aIRR=0.970, 95%CI: 0.948-0.993).\nThe CMR was significantly positively associated with urban populations (aIRR=1.027, 95%CI: 1.010-1.044), GDP per capita (aIRR=1.031, 95%CI: 1.021-1.041) and current health expenditure (aIRR=1.211, 95%CI: 1.040-1.410), and was significantly negatively associated with the number of hospital beds (aIRR=0.799, 95%CI: 0.696-0.916), number of nurses and midwives (aIRR=0.837, 95%CI: 0.749-0.936) and poverty headcount ratio at the national poverty lines (aIRR=0.960, 95%CI: 0.940-0.982).\nThe DCI was significantly positively associated with urban populations (aIRR=1.021, 95%CI: 1.009-1.034), population density (aIRR=1.000, 95%CI: 1.000-1.000) and researchers in R&amp;D (aIRR=1.000, 95%CI: 1.000-1.001), and was significantly negatively associated with the number of hospital beds (aIRR=0.731, 95%CI: 0.641-0.833), number of nurses and midwives (aIRR=0.904, 95%CI: 0.820-0.997) and poverty headcount ratio at the national poverty lines (aIRR=0.963, 95%CI: 0.945-0.982).\nThe results of the sensitivity analysis are reported in Table S4 and Table S5: we used the maximum and minimum temperatures instead of the average temperature, and then incorporated the two climate factors into the single-factor and multi-factor negative binomial regression. The results showed that the significance of different socio-ecological factors was essentially consistent. We found that only the variable of poverty headcount ratio at the national poverty lines (percentage of population) became significant after sensitivity analysis on IR, thus indicating that the analysis results were relatively reliable.\nDiscussion\nBy evaluating the spatial aggregation characteristics of three indicators:IR, CMR and DCI:on COVID-19 risk in 178 countries, Western Europe, Southern Europe, East Asia and some African countries, we found that all showed relatively large spatial correlations, thus indicating that COVID-19 broadly affects these countries/regions.\nBecause COVID-19 is highly contagious, after an outbreak occurs in a country/region, the virus tends to spread rapidly in surrounding countries. Italy was the first country in Europe to have a large outbreak of COVID-19, but the Italian health system adopted several control measures, such as timely intervention and containment measures brought about by decentralization, flexible financing mechanisms, private and public sector partnerships, and human resources mobilization, so that the IR and DCI could be effectively controlled. However, because some European countries did not perform effective prevention and control measures, such as blockading countries or cities, in early stages of the outbreak, the epidemic gradually broke out in countries including France, Germany, Spain and Portugal. In North America, the development of COVID-19 presents progressive characteristics (high-high and low-high mode), and Canada is also significantly affect clearly the United States by the COVID-19 outbreak, but the DCI in Mexico and other countries/regions in Central America remained relatively low. The United States also recently closed its border with Canada and Mexico and decreased the flow of people across the border. Because, blockading and quarantining provide very good protection, taking these measures in countries or cities is very important to decrease the risk of COVID-19 multinational spread. The potential transmission of COVID-19 in South America must not be ignored.\nSecond, both IR and CMR presented low-low patterns in China, thus indicating that China and some neighboring countries (such as South Korea and Singapore) have effectively reduced the risk to neighboring countries by implementing strong prevention and control measures against COVID-19 transmission and have also acquired valuable experience useful to other countries in fighting COVID-19 virus. However, notably, the IR of COVID-19 in India presents a low-low model, thus indicating that India is at low risk of COVID-19 transmission from surrounding countries, and consequently has a low DCI. However, as the world's second most populous country, India may have a high risk of COVID-19 transmission because of inadequate medical conditions and detection levels. Simultaneously, China, South Korea and other countries must strengthen screening of imported cases from other countries, reduce social contact among travelers and prevent the possible secondary transmission of COVID-19.\nThird, most countries/regions in Africa remain in a low-low mode, but the short distance and frequent contacts between Western and Southern Europe and North Africa may place North Africa at high risk of COVID-19 spread; Morocco currently has a low-high mode representing an early warning, and COVID-19 viruses must further be prevented from entering other parts of Africa. Although African countries took measures to prevent the Ebola outbreak in 2014, Africa remains one of the poorest countries worldwide, and it has a shortage of health resources to quickly control the outbreak. Studies have shown that the current spread of COVID-19 in West Africa urgently requires action to control the further spread of COVID-19 and improve the response capacity of affected countries in West Africa. Although most parts of Africa are in the low-low mode, they may also face threats. Many COVID-19 cases may be undetected, thus potentially explaining the current low-level indicators (IR, CMR and DCI).\nWe found that, in terms of urban development, both CMR and DCI were significantly positive associated with the urban population (percentage home of total population), and people per sq. km of land area had significant positive effects on the DCI. Non-drug intervention measures have already been implemented, and if traffic restrictions, social isolation and family measures are not ensured, the increase in population density and urbanization may result in many problems, such as public traffic, rural population health inequities, poor housing conditions, inadequate freshwater supply, and poor sanitation and ventilation systems, thus accelerating the spread of the COVID-19 virus, in agreement with previous research. The higher the urban population (percentage of total population), the faster the urbanization process of the country/region; consequently, aging and young people participating in social activities become more likely to aggravate the spread of the virus and increase the burden on the health system, in agreement with the results of one study. In addition, studies have shown that, with urbanization, the risk of infection and the chances of survival after COVID-19 infection among older individuals with complications is greatly increased, thus resulting in a significant increase in the CMR in the country/region.\nIn terms of the economy and growth, we found that GDP per capita (current 1,000 US$) was significantly positive associated with the IR and CMR of COVID-19, possibly because the GDP per capita tends to reflect a country's economic development level: with higher GDP per capita, governments can invest more in screening and treatment of patients with mild and severe cases of COVID-19. Consequently, with more confirmed cases and deaths, classification strategies can be considered for COVID-19 in low-income groups. Especially in economically underdeveloped areas such as Africa, similar symptoms can be used as a basis to implement a series of diagnostic tests. This method of raising clinical diagnostic standards was used in Wuhan, China.\nIn terms of health, we found that increasing the proportion of residents using at least basic sanitation services was significantly positive associated with the IR of COVID-19. For example, improving basic sanitation services and increasing contact between primary health workers and potential and diagnosed COVID-19 patients is very important. In particular, the government of Wuhan, China implemented nucleic acid testing on each resident via hospitals and primary health workers, thus enabling COVID-19 detection in a larger proportion and facilitating rapid control of COVID-19 risk transmission. Second, the numbers of hospital beds (per 1,000 people), nurses and midwives (per 1,000 people) were significantly negative associated with the IR and CMR of COVID-19, thus suggesting that COVID-19 risk should be controlled, and the number of hospital beds and nurses should be increased in a short period of time. The increase in the numbers of hospital beds and nurses can help achieve standardized management of patients and allow more medical resources to be concentrated on the treatment of severe cases. Some research has shown that some countries, such as Italy, China and the United States, have established Fangcang shelter hospitals or field hospitals and increased the numbers of regular hospital beds, intensive care beds and medical workers (by transferring resources from other regions and the military), reopened closed hospitals, and considered use of medical volunteers in the treatment of mild and severe COVID-19 cases; these measures are effective ways to reduce the IR and CMR. Third, among people infected with COVID-19, the proportion of the population spending more than 25% of household consumption or income on out-of-pocket health care expenses were significantly negative associated with the IR, whereas coverage with social insurance plans positively influences the IR. Higher income, enhanced health insurance coverage and decreased burden of medical treatment significantly increase the IR, thus suggesting that governments and health insurance providers should cooperate in the prevention and control of COVID-19. In addition to financial subsidies, the government should also reduce or grant exemptions for patient co-payments, to increase the possibility of COVID-19 patients receiving testing and treatment.\nIn science and technology, the number of researchers in R&amp;D (per million people) was significantly positive associated with the DCI. This improvement includes facilitating health science and technology input, strengthening basic life science research, fostering international cooperation between science and technology (such as in the development and use of effective drugs), providing more convenient testing technology, shortening testing times, expanding the scale of detection, improving treatment technology and performing ongoing vaccine development to reduce present and future COVID-19 transmission. In addition, the poverty headcount ratio at the national poverty lines (percentage of population) was significantly negative associated with the IR, CMR and DCI. Increases in the population in poverty and in racial discrimination greatly diminish accessibility to medical services. Government and society must address these problems through economic stimulus plans, unemployment relief programs, welfare and health safeguarding measures, and plans to decrease health spending by these groups.\nWe also found that climatic factors (temperature, RH, precipitation and wind speed) were not significantly associated with COVID-19 risk, in agreement with the results of some studies. However, previous studies have primarily considered the effects of single climate factors, thus potentially affecting the estimates of the results. There is no sufficient evidence indicating that climate factors have specific effects on the spread of COVID-19. This study also shows that in the measurement of COVID-19 risk, the influences of other factors should be considered:such as the constraints of economic development, transportation and other factors:to improve understanding of the mechanisms underlying interrelationships among factors.\nLimitations\nThis study has several limitations. First, we selected cross-sectional data for spatial analysis and regression modeling; therefore, the results may not reflect more changes in time, thus potentially decreasing the statistical ability to detect the relationships among various factors and COVID-19 risk. Second, owing to data matching across databases, some aspects of country/region data may have been lost, thus potentially affecting the spatial weight matrix estimation and regression modeling results. Third, because of the socio-ecological study design, we were unable to access data at the individual level, such as age, sex, occupation, economic and health status, and the actual exposure temperature of each person. However, future studies could adopt hybrid study designs, which use individual-level data from subpopulations to improve ecological extrapolation.\nConclusion\nBy using the data from 178 countries/regions, we found that socio-economic factors can significantly reduce the risk of COVID-19. As a next step in COVID-19 prevention, different countries/regions should focus on controlling urban populations, providing economic subsidies and medical resource supplies, and taking broad views of social welfare. Strategies may include population isolation, travel restrictions, case screening, cross-regional or national science and technology exchange to promote diagnosis and treatment, public welfare policy improvement, as well as decreasing the burden of low-income groups in obtaining medical treatment. Simultaneously, we must be alert to the COVID-19 risk in some countries in Africa and Asia, and must curb the second wave of COVID-19 transmission.\nSupplementary Material\nDeclaration of interests\nAll other authors declare no competing interests.\nPatient and public involvement\nThis research was done without patient involvement.

pathogen and host and often lead to a species specificity of the virus that can make interspecies transmissions difficult.\n Nevertheless, viruses do sporadically cross species barriers into other host populations, including humans.\n In zoonotic infections, many of these interspecies transfer events are dead end, where transmission is confined only to the animal-to-human route but sometimes viruses adapt to enable spread from human to human.\n A pathogen must overcome many hurdles to replicate successfully in a foreign host.\n The viral pathogen must enter the host cell, replicate with the assistance of host factors, evade inhibitory host products, exit the first cell and move on to the next, and possibly leave the initial host and transmit to another.\n Each of these stages may require adaptive changes in the pathogen.\n Although the factors that influence each stage of the replication and transmission of most agents have not been resolved, the genomics of both hosts and pathogens are now at hand and we have begun to understand some of the molecular changes that enable some viruses to adapt to a new

Disease Emergence","abstract":"Anthropogenic land use changes drive a range of infectious disease outbreaks and emergence events and modify the transmission of endemic infections.\n These drivers include agricultural encroachment, deforestation, road construction, dam building, irrigation, wetland modification, mining, the concentration or expansion of urban environments, coastal zone degradation, and other activities.\n These changes in turn cause a cascade of factors that exacerbate infectious disease emergence, such as forest fragmentation, disease introduction, pollution, poverty, and human migration.\n The Working Group on Land Use Change and Disease Emergence grew out of a special colloquium that convened international experts in infectious diseases, ecology, and environmental health to assess the current state of knowledge and to develop recommendations for addressing these environmental health challenges.\n The group established a systems model approach and priority lists of infectious diseases affected by ecologic degradation.\n Policy-relevant levels of the model include specific health risk factors, landscape or habitat change, and institutional (economic and behavioral) levels.\n The group recommended creating Centers of Excellence in Ecology and Health Research and Training, based at regional universities and/or research institutes with close links to the surrounding communities.\n The centers’ objectives would be 3-fold: a) to provide information to local communities about the links between environmental change and public health; b) to facilitate fully interdisciplinary research from a variety of natural, social, and health sciences and train professionals who can conduct interdisciplinary research; and c) to engage in science-based communication and assessment for policy making toward sustainable health and ecosystems.\n","id":"PMC1247383","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"National Institue of

incidence or geographic range.\n Among recent examples are HIV/AIDS, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, Lyme disease, and hemolytic uremic syndrome (a foodborne infection caused by certain strains of Escherichia coli).\n Specific factors precipitating disease emergence can be identified in virtually all cases.\n These include ecological, environmental, or demographic factors that place people at increased contact with a previously unfamiliar microbe or its natural host or promote dissemination.\n These factors are increasing in prevalence; this increase, together with the ongoing evolution of viral and microbial variants and selection for drug resistance, suggests that infections will continue to emerge and probably increase and emphasizes the urgent need for effective surveillance and control.\n Dr.\n David Satcher's article and this overview inaugurate Perspectives, a regular section in this journal intended to present and develop unifying concepts and strategies for considering emerging infections and their underlying factors.\n The editors welcome, as contributions to the Perspectives section, overviews, syntheses, and case studies that shed light on how and why infections

infectious diseases can be defined as infections that have newly appeared in a population or have existed but are rapidly increasing in incidence or geographic range.\n Among recent examples are HIV/AIDS, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, Lyme disease, and hemolytic uremic syndrome (a foodborne infection caused by certain strains of Escherichia coli).\n Specific factors precipitating disease emergence can be identified in virtually all cases.\n These include ecological, environmental, or demographic factors that place people at increased contact with a previously unfamiliar microbe or its natural host or promote dissemination.\n These factors are increasing in prevalence; this increase, together with the ongoing evolution of viral and microbial variants and selection for drug resistance, suggests that infections will continue to emerge and probably increase and emphasizes the urgent need for effective surveillance and control.\n Dr.\n David Satcher's article and this overview inaugurate Perspectives, a regular section in this journal intended to present and develop unifying concepts and strategies for considering emerging infections and their underlying factors.\n The editors welcome, as contributions to the Perspectives section, overviews, syntheses, and case studies that shed light on how and why infections emerge, and how they may be anticipated and prevented.\n","id":"PMC2626828","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","authors":[{"firstname":"S

Areas where plague still persists were mapped at the second level of the political/administrative divisions (counties).\n\n Selected demographic, socioeconomic, and environmental variables were described.\n\n\nResults\nPlague was found to be present for one or more years in 14 out of 25 countries in Latin America (1899–2012).\n\n Foci persisted in six countries, two of which have no report of current cases.\n\n There is evidence that human cases of plague still persist in 18 counties.\n\n Demographic and poverty patterns were observed in 11/18 counties.\n\n Four types of biomes are most commonly found.\n\n 12/18 have an average altitude higher than 1,300 meters above sea level.\n\n\nDiscussion\nEven though human plague cases are very localized, the risk is present, and unexpected outbreaks could occur.\n\n Countries need to make the final push to eliminate plague as a public health problem for the Americas.\n\n A further disaggregated risk evaluation is recommended, including identification of foci and possible interactions among areas where plague could emerge or re-emerge.\n\n A closer geographical approach and environmental characterization are suggested.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3916238","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Maria Cristina","surname":"Schneider","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Patricia","surname":"Najera","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sylvain","surname":"Aldighieri","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Deise I.","surname":"Galan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Eric","surname":"Bertherat","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alfonso","surname":"Ruiz","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Elsy","surname":"Dumit","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jean Marc","surname":"Gabastou","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Marcos A.","surname":"Espinal","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Joseph M.","surname":"Vinetz","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Joseph M.","surname":"Vinetz","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"United Nations Geographic Information Working Group (UNGIWG).

The presence of this imported YF case in China indicated that with the increase in business travel among countries, YF outbreaks in Africa can lead to the international spread of the disease.\n The

Risk for Severe Leptospirosis by Molecular Analysis of Environmental Surface Waters for Pathogenic <italic>Leptospira</italic>\n","abstract":"Background\nAlthough previous data indicate that the overall incidence of human leptospirosis in the Peruvian Amazon is similar in urban and rural sites, severe leptospirosis has been observed only in the urban context.\n\n As a potential explanation for this epidemiological observation, we tested the hypothesis that concentrations of more virulent Leptospira would be higher in urban than in rural environmental surface waters.\n\n\nMethods and Findings\nA quantitative real-time PCR assay was used to compare levels of Leptospira in urban and rural environmental surface waters in sites in the Peruvian Amazon region of Iquitos.\n\n Molecular taxonomic analysis of a 1,200-bp segment of the leptospiral 16S ribosomal RNA gene was used to identify Leptospira to the species level.\n\n Pathogenic Leptospira species were found only in urban slum water sources (Fisher's exact test; p = 0.013).\n\n The concentration of pathogen-related Leptospira was higher in urban than rural water sources (~103 leptospires/ml versus 0.5 × 102 leptospires/ml; F = 8.406, p &lt; 0.05).\n\n Identical 16S rRNA gene sequences from Leptospira interrogans serovar Icterohaemorrhagiae were found in urban slum market area gutter water and in human isolates, suggesting a specific mode of transmission from rats to humans.\n\n In a prospective, population-based study of patients presenting with acute febrile illness, isolation of L.\n\n interrogans-related leptospires from humans was significantly associated with urban acquisition (75% of urban isolates); human isolates of other leptospiral species were associated with rural acquisition (78% of rural isolates) (chi-square analysis; p &lt; 0.01).\n\n This distribution of human leptospiral isolates mirrored the distribution of leptospiral 16S ribosomal gene sequences in urban and rural water sources.\n\n\nConclusions\nOur findings data support the hypothesis that urban severe leptospirosis in the Peruvian Amazon is associated with higher concentrations of more pathogenic leptospires at sites of exposure and transmission.\n\n This combined quantitative and molecular taxonomical risk assessment of environmental surface waters is globally applicable for assessing risk for leptospiral infection and severe disease in leptospirosis-endemic regions.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1551915","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Christian

present in aquatic environments.\n We determined the genome sequence of L.\n biflexa, making it the first saprophytic Leptospira to be sequenced.\n The L.\n biflexa genome has 3,590 protein-coding genes distributed across three circular replicons: the major 3,604 chromosome, a smaller 278-kb replicon that also carries essential genes, and a third 74-kb replicon.\n Comparative sequence analysis provides evidence that L.\n biflexa is an excellent model for the study of Leptospira evolution; we conclude that 2052 genes (61%) represent a progenitor genome that existed before divergence of pathogenic and saprophytic Leptospira species.\n Comparisons of the L.\n biflexa genome with two pathogenic Leptospira species reveal several major findings.\n Nearly one-third of the L.\n biflexa genes are absent in pathogenic Leptospira.\n We suggest that once incorporated into the L.\n biflexa genome, laterally transferred DNA undergoes minimal rearrangement due to physical restrictions imposed by high gene density and limited presence of transposable elements.\n In contrast, the genomes of pathogenic Leptospira species undergo frequent rearrangements, often involving recombination between insertion sequences.\n Identification of genes common to the two pathogenic species, L.\n borgpetersenii and L.\n interrogans, but absent in L.\n biflexa, is consistent with a role for these genes in pathogenesis.\n Differences in environmental sensing capacities of L.\n biflexa, L.\n borgpetersenii, and L.\n interrogans suggest a model which postulates that loss of signal transduction functions in L.\n borgpetersenii has impaired its survival outside a mammalian host, whereas L.\n interrogans has retained environmental sensory functions that facilitate disease transmission through

molecular features of leptospires isolated from 104 leptospirosis patients in Guadeloupe (n?=?85) and Martinique (n?=?19) and six rats captured in Guadeloupe, between 2004 and 2012.\nMethods and Findings\nStrains were studied by serogrouping, PFGE, MLVA, and sequencing 16SrRNA and secY.\n\n DNA extracts from blood samples collected from 36 patients in Martinique were also used for molecular typing of leptospires via PCR.\n\n Phylogenetic analyses revealed thirteen different genotypes clustered into five main clades that corresponded to the species: L.\n\n interrogans, L.\n\n kirschneri, L.\n\n borgpetersenii, L.\n\n noguchi, and L.\n\n santarosai.\n\n We also identified L.\n\n kmetyi in at least two patients with acute leptospirosis.\n\n This is the first time, to our knowledge, that this species has been identified in humans.\n\n The most prevalent genotypes were associated with L.\n\n interrogans serovars Icterohaemorrhagiae and Copenhageni, L.\n\n kirschneri serovar Bogvere, and L.\n\n borgpetersenii serovar Arborea.\n\n We were unable to identify nine strains at the serovar level and comparison of genotyping results to the MLST database revealed new secY alleles.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe overall serovar distribution in the French West Indies was unique compared to the neighboring islands.\n\n Typing of leptospiral isolates also suggested the existence of previously undescribed serovars.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3597474","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

the risk of mosquito-borne diseases in a warmer and more populated world: a multi-model, multi-scenario intercomparison modelling study","abstract":"Background\nMosquito-borne diseases are expanding their range, and re-emerging in areas where they had subsided for decades.\n\n The extent to which climate change influences the transmission suitability and population at risk of mosquito-borne diseases across different altitudes and population densities has not been investigated.\n\n The aim of this study was to quantify the extent to which climate change will influence the length of the transmission season and estimate the population at risk of mosquito-borne diseases in the future, given different population densities across an altitudinal gradient.\n\n\nMethods\nUsing a multi-model multi-scenario framework, we estimated changes in the length of the transmission season and global population at risk of malaria and dengue for different altitudes and population densities for the period 1951–99. We generated projections from six mosquito-borne disease models, driven by four global circulation models, using four representative concentration pathways, and three shared socioeconomic pathways.\n\n\nFindings\nWe show that malaria suitability will increase by 1·6 additional months (mean 0·5, SE 0·03) in tropical highlands in the African region, the Eastern Mediterranean region, and the region of the Americas.\n\n Dengue suitability will increase in lowlands in the Western Pacific region and the Eastern Mediterranean region by 4·0 additional months (mean 1·7, SE 0·2).\n\n Increases in the climatic suitability of both diseases will be greater in rural areas than in urban areas.\n\n The epidemic belt for both diseases will expand towards temperate areas.\n\n The population at risk of both diseases might increase by up to 4·7 additional billion people by 2070 relative to 1970–99, particularly in lowlands and urban areas.\n\n\nInterpretation\nRising global mean temperature will increase the climatic suitability of both diseases particularly in already endemic areas.\n\n The predicted expansion towards higher altitudes and temperate regions suggests that outbreaks can occur in areas where people might be immunologically naive and public health systems unprepared.\n\n The population at risk of malaria and dengue will be higher in densely populated urban areas in the WHO African region, South-East Asia region, and the region of the Americas, although we did not account for urban-heat island effects, which can further alter the risk of disease transmission.\n\n\nFunding\nUK Space Agency, Royal Society, UK National Institute for Health Research, and Swedish Research

water vapour at a resolution of 0.5° and equations describing the life cycle processes of the tick were used.\n The climate in the target region affected the rates of the life cycle processes of H.\n marginatum: development rates increased, mortality rates in molting stages decreased, and the survival rates of questing ticks decreased in wide territories of the Mediterranean basin.\n The modeling framework indicated the existence of critical areas in the Balkans, central Europe, and the western coast of France, where the physiological processes of the tick improved to extents that are consistent with the persistence of populations if introduced.\n A spatially explicit risk assessment was performed to detect candidate areas where active surveys should be performed to monitor changes in tick density or persistence after a hypothetical introduction.\n We detected areas where the critical abiotic (climate) and biotic (host density) factors overlap, including most of the Iberian peninsula, the Mediterranean coast of France, eastern Turkey, and portions of the western Black Sea region.\n Wild ungulate densities are unavailable for large regions of the territory, a factor that might affect the outcome of the study.\n The risk of successfully establishing H.\n marginatum populations at northern latitudes of its current colonization range seems to be still low, even if the

viruses including rhinovirus, RSV, adenovirus, metapneumovirus and coronavirus share the same seasonality, since these viral acute respiratory tract infections (vARIs) are much more common in winter than summer.\n Unfortunately, early investigations that used recycled “pedigree” virus strains seem to have led microbiologists to dismiss the common folk belief that vARIs often follow chilling.\n Today, incontrovertible evidence shows that ambient temperature dips and host chilling increase the incidence and severity of vARIs.\n This review considers four possible mechanisms, M1 - 4, that can explain this link: (M1) increased crowding in winter may enhance viral transmission; (M2) lower temperatures may increase the stability of virions outside the body; (M3) chilling may increase host susceptibility; (M4) lower temperatures or host chilling may activate dormant virions.\n There is little evidence for M1 or M2, which are incompatible with tropical observations.\n Epidemiological anomalies such as the repeated simultaneous arrival of vARIs over wide geographical areas, the rapid cessation of influenza epidemics, and the low attack rate of influenza within families are compatible with M4, but not M3 (in its simple form).\n M4 seems to be the main driver of seasonality, but M3 may also play an important role.\n","id":"PMC7116927","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Patrick D.","surname":"Shaw

influenza","abstract":"Background\nImproving knowledge about influenza transmission is crucial to upgrade surveillance network and to develop accurate predicting models to enhance public health intervention strategies.\n\n Epidemics usually occur in winter in temperate countries and during the rainy season for tropical countries, suggesting a climate impact on influenza spread.\n\n Despite a lot of studies, the role of weather on influenza spread is not yet fully understood.\n\n In the present study, we investigated this issue at two different levels.\n\n\nMethods\nFirst, we evaluated how weekly (intra-annual) incidence variations of clinical diseases could be linked to those of climatic factors.\n\n We considered that only a fraction of the human population is susceptible at the beginning of a year due to immunity acquired from previous years.\n\n Second, we focused on epidemic sizes (cumulated number of clinical reported cases) and looked at how their inter-annual and regional variations could be related to differences in the winter climatic conditions of the epidemic years over the regions.\n\n We quantified the impact of fifteen climatic variables in France using the Réseau des GROG surveillance network incidence data over eleven regions and nine years.\n\n\nResults\nAt the epidemic scale, no impact of climatic factors was highlighted.\n\n At the intra-annual scale, six climatic variables had a significant impact: average temperature (5.54?±?1.09 %), absolute humidity (5.94?±?1.08 %), daily variation of absolute humidity (3.02?±?1.17 %), sunshine duration (3.46?±?1.06 %), relative humidity (4.92?±?1.20 %) and daily variation of relative humidity (4.46?±?1.24 %).\n\n Since in practice the impact of two highly correlated variables is very hard to disentangle, we performed a principal component analysis that revealed two groups of three highly correlated climatic variables: one including the first three highlighted climatic variables on the one hand, the other including the last three ones on the other hand.\n\n\nConclusions\nThese results suggest that, among the six factors that appeared to be significant, only two (one per group) could in fact have a real effect on influenza spread, although it is not possible to determine which one based on a purely statistical argument.\n\n Our results support the idea of an important role of climate

between Humidity and Influenza A Viability in Droplets and Implications for Influenza’s Seasonality","abstract":"Humidity has been associated with influenza’s seasonality, but the mechanisms underlying the relationship remain unclear.\n There is no consistent explanation for influenza’s transmission patterns that applies to both temperate and tropical regions.\n This study aimed to determine the relationship between ambient humidity and viability of the influenza A virus (IAV) during transmission between hosts and to explain the mechanisms underlying it.\n We measured the viability of IAV in droplets consisting of various model media, chosen to isolate effects of salts and proteins found in respiratory fluid, and in human mucus, at relative humidities (RH) ranging from 17% to 100%.\n In all media and mucus, viability was highest when RH was either close to 100% or below ?50%.\n When RH decreased from 84% to 50%, the relationship between viability and RH depended on droplet composition: viability decreased in saline solutions, did not change significantly in solutions supplemented with proteins, and increased dramatically in mucus.\n Additionally, viral decay increased linearly with salt concentration in saline solutions but not when they were supplemented with proteins.\n There appear to be three regimes of IAV viability in droplets, defined by humidity: physiological conditions (?100% RH) with high viability, concentrated conditions (50% to near 100% RH) with lower viability depending on the composition of media, and dry conditions (&lt;50% RH) with high viability.\n This paradigm could help resolve conflicting findings in the literature on the relationship between IAV viability in aerosols and humidity, and results in human mucus could help explain influenza’s seasonality in different regions.\n","id":"PMC3463543","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

Analysis of an Equine Influenza (A/H3N8) Outbreak","abstract":"The influences of relative humidity and ambient temperature on the transmission of influenza A viruses have recently been established under controlled laboratory conditions.\n The interplay of meteorological factors during an actual influenza epidemic is less clear, and research into the contribution of wind to epidemic spread is scarce.\n By applying geostatistics and survival analysis to data from a large outbreak of equine influenza (A/H3N8), we quantified the association between hazard of infection and air temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, and wind velocity, whilst controlling for premises-level covariates.\n The pattern of disease spread in space and time was described using extraction mapping and instantaneous hazard curves.\n Meteorological conditions at each premises location were estimated by kriging daily meteorological data and analysed as time-lagged time-varying predictors using generalised Cox regression.\n Meteorological covariates time-lagged by three days were strongly associated with hazard of influenza infection, corresponding closely with the incubation period of equine influenza.\n Hazard of equine influenza infection was higher when relative humidity was &lt;60% and lowest on days when daily maximum air temperature was 20–25°C.\n Wind speeds &gt;30 km hour?1 from the direction of nearby infected premises were associated with increased hazard of infection.\n Through combining detailed influenza outbreak and meteorological data, we provide empirical evidence for the underlying environmental mechanisms that influenced the local spread of an outbreak of influenza A.\n Our analysis supports, and extends, the findings of studies into influenza A transmission conducted under laboratory conditions.\n The relationships described are of direct importance for managing disease risk during influenza outbreaks in horses, and more generally, advance our understanding of the transmission of influenza A viruses under field conditions.\n","id":"PMC3335077","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

Influenza Seasonality: Reconciling Patterns across Temperate and Tropical Regions","abstract":"Background\nDespite the significant disease burden of the influenza virus in humans, our understanding of the basis for its pronounced seasonality remains incomplete.\n\n Past observations that influenza epidemics occur in the winter across temperate climates, combined with insufficient knowledge about the epidemiology of influenza in the tropics, led to the perception that cool and dry conditions were a necessary, and possibly sufficient, driver of influenza epidemics.\n\n Recent reports of substantial levels of influenza virus activity and well-defined seasonality in tropical regions, where warm and humid conditions often persist year-round, have rendered previous hypotheses insufficient for explaining global patterns of influenza.\n\n\nObjective\nIn this review, we examined the scientific evidence for the seasonal mechanisms that potentially explain the complex seasonal patterns of influenza disease activity observed globally.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this review we assessed the strength of a range of hypotheses that attempt to explain observations of influenza seasonality across different latitudes and how they relate to each other.\n\n We reviewed studies describing population-scale observations, mathematical models, and ecological, laboratory, and clinical experiments pertaining to influenza seasonality.\n\n The literature review includes studies that directly mention the topic of influenza seasonality, as well as other topics we believed to be relevant.\n\n We also developed an analytical framework that highlights the complex interactions among environmental stimuli, mediating mechanisms, and the seasonal timing of influenza epidemics and identify critical areas for further research.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe central questions in influenza seasonality remain unresolved.\n\n Future research is particularly needed in tropical localities, where our understanding of seasonality remains poor, and will require a combination of experimental and observational studies.\n\n Further understanding of the environmental factors that drive influenza circulation also may be useful to predict how dynamics will be affected at regional levels by global climate

with influenza during warm winters, thereby leaving an unnaturally large fraction of susceptible individuals in the population going into the next season, which can lead to early and severe epidemics.\n\nIn the event of continued global warming, warm winters such as that of 2011-12 are expected to occur more frequently.\n Our results thus suggest that expedited manufacture and distribution of influenza vaccines after mild winters has the potential to mitigate the severity of future influenza epidemics.\n","id":"PMC3770759","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

have indicated that the timing of seasonal influenza epidemic varies across latitude, suggesting the involvement of meteorological and environmental conditions in the transmission of influenza.\n\n In this study, we investigated the link between meteorological parameters and influenza activity in 9 sub-national areas with temperate and subtropical climates: Berlin (Germany), Ljubljana (Slovenia), Castile and León (Spain) and all 6 districts in Israel.\n\n\nMethods\nWe estimated weekly influenza-associated influenza-like-illness (ILI) or Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI) incidence to represent influenza activity using data from each country’s sentinel surveillance during 2000–2011 (Spain) and 2006–2011 (all others).\n\n Meteorological data was obtained from ground stations, satellite and assimilated data.\n\n Two generalized additive models (GAM) were developed, with one using specific humidity as a covariate and another using minimum temperature.\n\n Precipitation and solar radiation were included as additional covariates in both models.\n\n The models were adjusted for previous weeks’ influenza activity, and were trained separately for each study location.\n\n\nResults\nInfluenza activity was inversely associated (p&lt;0.05) with specific humidity in all locations.\n\n Minimum temperature was inversely associated with influenza in all 3 temperate locations, but not in all subtropical locations.\n\n Inverse associations between influenza and solar radiation were found in most locations.\n\n Associations with precipitation were location-dependent and inconclusive.\n\n We used the models to estimate influenza activity a week ahead for the 2010/2011 period which was not used in training the models.\n\n With exception of Ljubljana and Israel’s Haifa District, the models could closely follow the observed data especially during the start and the end of epidemic period.\n\n In these locations, correlation coefficients between the observed and estimated ranged between 0.55 to 0.91and the model-estimated influenza peaks were within 3 weeks from the observations.\n\n\nConclusion\nOur study demonstrated the significant link between specific humidity and influenza activity across temperate and subtropical climates, and that inclusion of meteorological parameters in the surveillance system may further our understanding of influenza transmission patterns.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4550247","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Radina

Leads to Loss of Infectious Influenza Virus from Simulated Coughs","abstract":"Background\nThe role of relative humidity in the aerosol transmission of influenza was examined in a simulated examination room containing coughing and breathing manikins.\n\n\nMethods\nNebulized influenza was coughed into the examination room and Bioaerosol samplers collected size-fractionated aerosols (&lt;1 µM, 1–4 µM, and &gt;4 µM aerodynamic diameters) adjacent to the breathing manikin’s mouth and also at other locations within the room.\n\n At constant temperature, the RH was varied from 7–73% and infectivity was assessed by the viral plaque assay.\n\n\nResults\nTotal virus collected for 60 minutes retained 70.6–77.3% infectivity at relative humidity ?23% but only 14.6–22.2% at relative humidity ?43%.\n\n Analysis of the individual aerosol fractions showed a similar loss in infectivity among the fractions.\n\n Time interval analysis showed that most of the loss in infectivity within

public health threat.\n\n Because of their novelty, there are limited measures available to control their early spread.\n\n Learning from past outbreaks is important for future preparation.\n\n The Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus (MERS?CoV ) 2015 outbreak in the Republic of Korea (ROK) provides one such opportunity.\n\n\nObjectives\nWe demonstrated through quantitative methodologies how to estimate MERS?CoV's transmissibility and identified the effective countermeasures that stopped its spread.\n\n\nMethods\nUsing the outbreak data, statistical methods were employed to estimate the basic reproductive number R\n0, the average number of secondary cases produced by a typical primary case during its entire infectious period in a fully susceptible population.\n\n A transmission dynamics model was also proposed to estimate R\n0 and to identify the most effective countermeasures.\n\n The consistency between results will provide cross?validation of the approaches.\n\n\nResults\n\nR\n0 ranged from 2.5 with 95% confidence interval (CI): [1.7, 3.1] (using the sequential Bayesian method) to 7.2 with 95% CI: [5.3, 9.4] (using the Nowcasting method).\n\n Estimates from transmission model were higher but overlapped with these.\n\n Personal protection and rapid confirmation of cases were identified as the most important countermeasures.\n\n\nConclusions\nOur estimates were in agreement with others from the ROK outbreak, albeit significantly higher than estimates based on other small outbreaks and sporadic cases of MERS?CoV.\n\n The large?scale outbreak in the ROK was jointly due to the high transmissibility in the healthcare?associated setting and the Korean culture?associated contact behaviour.\n\n Limiting

epidemic has brought serious social burden.\n Identifying possible routes of the airborne transmission and predicting the potential infection risk are meaningful for infectious disease control.\n In the present study, an internal spread route between horizontal adjacent flats induced by air infiltration was investigated.\n On-site measurements were conducted, and tracer gas technique was employed.\n Two measurement scenarios, closed window mode and open window mode, were compared.\n Using the calculated air change rate and mass fraction, the cross-infection risk was estimated using the Wells–Riley model.\n It found that tracer gas concentrations in receptor rooms are one order lower than the source room, and the infection risks are also one order lower.\n Opening windows results in larger air change rate on the one hand, but higher mass fraction on the other hand.\n Higher mass fraction not necessarily results in higher infection risk as the pathogen concentration in the source room is reduced by the higher air change rate.\n In the present study, opening windows could significantly reduce the infection risk of the index room but slightly reduce the risks in receptor rooms.\n The mass fraction of air originated from the index room to the receptor units could be 0.28 and the relative cross-infection risk through the internal transmission route could be 9%, which are higher than the external spread through single-sided window flush.\n The study implicates that the horizontal transmission route induced by air infiltration should not be underestimated.\n","id":"PMC7116928","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile

coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing Municipal Science and Technology

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in

pathogen and host and often lead to a species specificity of the virus that can make interspecies transmissions difficult.\n Nevertheless, viruses do sporadically cross species barriers into other host populations, including humans.\n In zoonotic infections, many of these interspecies transfer events are dead end, where transmission is confined only to the animal-to-human route but sometimes viruses adapt to enable spread from human to human.\n A pathogen must overcome many hurdles to replicate successfully in a foreign host.\n The viral pathogen must enter the host cell, replicate with the assistance of host factors, evade inhibitory host products, exit the first cell and move on to the next, and possibly leave the initial host and transmit to another.\n Each of these stages may require adaptive changes in the pathogen.\n Although the factors that influence each stage of the replication and transmission of most agents have not been resolved, the genomics of both hosts and pathogens are now at hand and we have begun to understand some of the molecular changes that enable some viruses to adapt to a new

Disease Emergence","abstract":"Anthropogenic land use changes drive a range of infectious disease outbreaks and emergence events and modify the transmission of endemic infections.\n These drivers include agricultural encroachment, deforestation, road construction, dam building, irrigation, wetland modification, mining, the concentration or expansion of urban environments, coastal zone degradation, and other activities.\n These changes in turn cause a cascade of factors that exacerbate infectious disease emergence, such as forest fragmentation, disease introduction, pollution, poverty, and human migration.\n The Working Group on Land Use Change and Disease Emergence grew out of a special colloquium that convened international experts in infectious diseases, ecology, and environmental health to assess the current state of knowledge and to develop recommendations for addressing these environmental health challenges.\n The group established a systems model approach and priority lists of infectious diseases affected by ecologic degradation.\n Policy-relevant levels of the model include specific health risk factors, landscape or habitat change, and institutional (economic and behavioral) levels.\n The group recommended creating Centers of Excellence in Ecology and Health Research and Training, based at regional universities and/or research institutes with close links to the surrounding communities.\n The centers’ objectives would be 3-fold: a) to provide information to local communities about the links between environmental change and public health; b) to facilitate fully interdisciplinary research from a variety of natural, social, and health sciences and train professionals who can conduct interdisciplinary research; and c) to engage in science-based communication and assessment for policy making toward sustainable health and ecosystems.\n","id":"PMC1247383","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"National Institue of

incidence or geographic range.\n Among recent examples are HIV/AIDS, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, Lyme disease, and hemolytic uremic syndrome (a foodborne infection caused by certain strains of Escherichia coli).\n Specific factors precipitating disease emergence can be identified in virtually all cases.\n These include ecological, environmental, or demographic factors that place people at increased contact with a previously unfamiliar microbe or its natural host or promote dissemination.\n These factors are increasing in prevalence; this increase, together with the ongoing evolution of viral and microbial variants and selection for drug resistance, suggests that infections will continue to emerge and probably increase and emphasizes the urgent need for effective surveillance and control.\n Dr.\n David Satcher's article and this overview inaugurate Perspectives, a regular section in this journal intended to present and develop unifying concepts and strategies for considering emerging infections and their underlying factors.\n The editors welcome, as contributions to the Perspectives section, overviews, syntheses, and case studies that shed light on how and why infections

Heat-related mortality rates declined significantly over time in 19 of the 28 cities.\n For the 28-city average, there were 41.0 +/- 4.8 (mean +/- SE) excess heat-related deaths per year (per standard

Adverse health impacts from heat waves can be avoided, and epidemiologic studies have identified specific population and community characteristics that mark vulnerability to heat waves.\n\n\nObjectives\nWe situated vulnerability to heat in geographic space and identified potential areas for intervention and further research.\n\n\nMethods\nWe mapped and analyzed 10 vulnerability factors for heat-related morbidity/mortality in the United States: six demographic characteristics and two household air conditioning variables from the U.\n\nS.\n\n Census Bureau, vegetation cover from satellite images, and diabetes prevalence from a national survey.\n\n We performed a factor analysis of these 10 variables and assigned values of increasing vulnerability for the four resulting factors to each of 39,794 census tracts.\n\n We added the four factor scores to obtain a cumulative heat vulnerability index value.\n\n\nResults\nFour factors explained &gt; 75% of the total variance in the original 10 vulnerability variables: a) social/environmental vulnerability (combined education/poverty/race/green space), b) social isolation, c) air conditioning prevalence, and d) proportion elderly/diabetes.\n\n We found substantial spatial variability of heat vulnerability nationally, with generally higher vulnerability in the Northeast and Pacific Coast and the lowest in

mathematical modelling study","abstract":"Background\nAn outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to 95?333 confirmed cases as of March 5, 2020. Understanding the early transmission dynamics of the infection and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures is crucial for assessing the potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas.\n\n Combining a mathematical model of severe SARS-CoV-2 transmission with four datasets from within and outside Wuhan, we estimated how transmission in Wuhan varied between December, 2019, and February, 2020. We used these estimates to assess the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission to occur in locations outside Wuhan if cases were introduced.\n\n\nMethods\nWe combined a stochastic transmission model with data on cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan and international cases that originated in Wuhan to estimate how transmission had varied over time during January, 2020, and February, 2020. Based on these estimates, we then calculated the probability that newly introduced cases might generate outbreaks in other areas.\n\n To estimate the early dynamics of transmission in Wuhan, we fitted a stochastic transmission dynamic model to multiple publicly available datasets on cases in Wuhan and internationally exported cases from Wuhan.\n\n The four datasets we fitted to were: daily number of new internationally exported cases (or lack thereof), by date of onset, as of Jan 26, 2020; daily number of new cases in Wuhan with no market exposure, by date of onset, between Dec 1, 2019, and Jan 1, 2020; daily number of new cases in China, by date of onset, between Dec 29, 2019, and Jan 23, 2020; and proportion of infected passengers on evacuation flights between Jan 29, 2020, and Feb 4, 2020. We used an additional two datasets for comparison with model outputs: daily number of new exported cases from Wuhan (or lack thereof) in countries with high connectivity to Wuhan (ie, top 20 most at-risk countries), by date of confirmation, as of Feb 10, 2020; and data on new confirmed cases reported in Wuhan between Jan 16, 2020, and Feb 11, 2020.\nFindings\nWe estimated that the median daily reproduction number (Rt) in Wuhan declined from 2·35 (95% CI 1·15–4·77) 1 week before travel restrictions were introduced on Jan 23, 2020, to 1·05 (0·41–2·39) 1 week after.\n\n Based on our estimates of Rt, assuming SARS-like variation, we calculated that in locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan in early January, once there are at least four independently introduced cases, there is a more than 50% chance the infection will establish within that population.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur results show that COVID-19 transmission probably declined in Wuhan during late January, 2020, coinciding with the introduction of travel control measures.\n\n As more cases arrive in international locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan before these control measures, it is likely many chains of transmission will fail to establish initially, but might lead to new outbreaks eventually.\n\n\nFunding\nWellcome Trust, Health Data Research UK, Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, and National Institute for Health Research.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7158569","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Science ;, The Lancet Pub.

spread of the 2019-nCoV outbreak originating in Wuhan, China: a modelling study","abstract":"Background\nSince Dec 31, 2019, the Chinese city of Wuhan has reported an outbreak of atypical pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n Cases have been exported to other Chinese cities, as well as internationally, threatening to trigger a global outbreak.\n\n Here, we provide an estimate of the size of the epidemic in Wuhan on the basis of the number of cases exported from Wuhan to cities outside mainland China and forecast the extent of the domestic and global public health risks of epidemics, accounting for social and non-pharmaceutical prevention interventions.\n\n\nMethods\nWe used data from Dec 31, 2019, to Jan 28, 2020, on the number of cases exported from Wuhan internationally (known days of symptom onset from Dec 25, 2019, to Jan 19, 2020) to infer the number of infections in Wuhan from Dec 1, 2019, to Jan 25, 2020. Cases exported domestically were then estimated.\n\n We forecasted the national and global spread of 2019-nCoV, accounting for the effect of the metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan and surrounding cities, which began Jan 23–24, 2020. We used data on monthly flight bookings from the Official Aviation Guide and data on human mobility across more than 300 prefecture-level cities in mainland China from the Tencent database.\n\n Data on confirmed cases were obtained from the reports published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n Serial interval estimates were based on previous studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV).\n\n A susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered metapopulation model was used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China.\n\n The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credibile interval (CrI).\n\n\nFindings\nIn our baseline scenario, we estimated that the basic reproductive number for 2019-nCoV was 2·68 (95% CrI 2·47–2·86) and that 75?815 individuals (95% CrI 37?304–130?330) have been infected in Wuhan as of Jan 25, 2020. The epidemic doubling time was 6·4 days (95% CrI 5·8–7·1).\n\n We estimated that in the baseline scenario, Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen had imported 461 (95% CrI 227–805), 113 (57–193), 98 (49–168), 111 (56–191), and 80 (40–139) infections from Wuhan, respectively.\n\n If the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV were similar everywhere domestically and over time, we inferred that epidemics are already growing exponentially in multiple major cities of China with a lag time behind the Wuhan outbreak of about 1–2 weeks.\n\n\nInterpretation\nGiven that 2019-nCoV is no longer contained within Wuhan, other major Chinese cities are probably sustaining localised outbreaks.\n\n Large cities overseas with close transport links to China could also become outbreak epicentres, unless substantial public health interventions at both the population and personal levels are implemented immediately.\n\n Independent self-sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally could become inevitable because of substantial exportation of presymptomatic cases and in the absence of large-scale public health interventions.\n\n Preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be readied for quick deployment globally.\n\n\nFunding\nHealth and Medical Research Fund (Hong Kong, China).\n\n\n","id":"PMC7159271","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

affected countries, Sierra Leone, Guinea, Liberia, and Nigeria, have been struggling to contain and to mitigate the outbreak.\n The ongoing rise in confirmed and suspected cases, 2615 as of 20 August 2014, is considered to increase the risk of international dissemination, especially because the epidemic is now affecting cities with major commercial airports.\n\nMethod: We use the Global Epidemic and Mobility Model to generate stochastic, individual based simulations of epidemic spread worldwide, yielding, among other measures, the incidence and seeding events at a daily resolution for 3,362 subpopulations in 220 countries.\n The mobility model integrates daily airline passenger traffic worldwide and the disease model includes the community, hospital, and burial transmission dynamic.\n We use a multimodel inference approach calibrated on data from 6 July to the date of 9 August 2014. The estimates obtained were used to generate a 3-month ensemble forecast that provides quantitative estimates of the local transmission of Ebola virus disease in West Africa and the probability of international spread if the containment measures are not successful at curtailing the outbreak.\n\nResults: We model the short-term growth rate of the disease in the affected West African countries and estimate the basic reproductive number to be in the range 1.5 ? 2.0 (interval at the 1/10 relative likelihood).\n We simulated the international spreading of the outbreak and provide the estimate for the probability of Ebola virus disease case importation in countries across the world.\n Results indicate that the short-term (3 and 6 weeks) probability of international spread outside the African region is small, but not negligible.\n The extension of the outbreak is more likely occurring in African countries, increasing the risk of international dissemination on a longer time scale.\n \n","id":"PMC4169359","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Marcelo F.

using imported case counts of international travelers, often under the assumption that all cases in travelers are ascertained.\n Recent work indicates variation among countries in detection capacity for imported cases.\n Singapore has historically had very strong epidemiological surveillance and contact-tracing capacity and has shown in the COVID-19 epidemic evidence of a high sensitivity of case detection.\n We therefore used a Bayesian modeling approach to estimate the relative imported case detection capacity for other countries compared to that of Singapore.\n We estimate that the global ability to detect imported cases is 38% (95% HPDI 22% – 64%) of Singapore’s capacity.\n Equivalently, an estimate of 2.8 (95% HPDI 1.5 – 4.4) times the current number of imported cases, could have been detected, if all countries had had the same detection capacity as Singapore.\n Using the second component of the Global Health Security index to stratify likely case-detection capacities, we found that the ability to detect imported cases relative to Singapore among high surveillance locations is 40% (95% HPDI 22% – 67%), among intermediate surveillance locations it is 37% (95% HPDI 18% – 68%), and among low surveillance locations it is 11% (95% HPDI 0% – 42%).\n Using a simple mathematical model, we further find that treating all travelers as if they were residents (rather than accounting for the brief stay of some of these travelers in Wuhan) can modestly contribute to underestimation of prevalence as well.\n We conclude that estimates of case counts in Wuhan based on assumptions of perfect detection in travelers may be underestimated by several fold, and severity correspondingly overestimated by several fold.\n Undetected cases are likely in countries around the world, with greater risk in countries of low detection capacity and high connectivity to the epicenter of the outbreak.\n","id":"PMC7239063","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Cold Spring

clinic, and reporting, before and after Jan 18, 2020, as awareness of the outbreak increased.\n\n All data were made publicly available in real time.\n\n\nFindings\nWe collected data for 507 patients with COVID-19 reported between Jan 13 and Jan 31, 2020, including 364 from mainland China and 143 from outside of China.\n\n 281 (55%) patients were male and the median age was 46 years (IQR 35–60).\n\n Few patients (13 [3%]) were younger than 15 years and the age profile of Chinese patients adjusted for baseline demographics confirmed a deficit of infections among children.\n\n Across the analysed period, delays between symptom onset and seeking care at a hospital or clinic were longer in Hubei province than in other provinces in mainland China and internationally.\n\n In mainland China, these delays decreased from 5 days before Jan 18, 2020, to 2 days thereafter until Jan 31, 2020 (p=0·0009).\n\n Although our sample captures only 507 (5·2%) of 9826 patients with COVID-19 reported by official sources during the analysed period, our data align with an official report published by Chinese authorities on Jan 28, 2020.\nInterpretation\nNews reports and social media can help reconstruct the progression of an outbreak and provide detailed patient-level data in the context of a health emergency.\n\n The availability of a central physician-oriented social network facilitated the compilation of publicly available COVID-19 data in China.\n\n As the outbreak progresses, social media and news reports will probably capture a diminishing fraction of COVID-19 cases globally due to reporting fatigue and overwhelmed health-care systems.\n\n In the early stages of an outbreak, availability of public datasets is important to encourage analytical efforts by independent teams and provide robust evidence to guide interventions.\n\n\nFunding\nFogarty International Center, US National Institutes of

Cases exported domestically were then estimated.\n\n We forecasted the national and global spread of 2019-nCoV, accounting for the effect of the metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan and surrounding cities, which began Jan 23–24, 2020. We used data on monthly flight bookings from the Official Aviation Guide and data on human mobility across more than 300 prefecture-level cities in mainland China from the Tencent database.\n\n Data on confirmed cases were obtained from the reports published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n Serial interval estimates were based on previous studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV).\n\n A susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered metapopulation model was used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China.\n\n The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credibile interval (CrI).\n\n\nFindings\nIn our baseline scenario, we estimated that the basic reproductive number for 2019-nCoV was 2·68 (95% CrI 2·47–2·86) and that 75?815 individuals (95% CrI 37?304–130?330) have been infected in Wuhan as of Jan 25, 2020. The epidemic doubling time was 6·4 days (95% CrI 5·8–7·1).\n\n We estimated that in the baseline scenario, Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen had imported 461 (95% CrI 227–805), 113 (57–193), 98 (49–168), 111 (56–191), and 80 (40–139) infections from Wuhan, respectively.\n\n If the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV were similar everywhere domestically and over time, we inferred that epidemics are already growing exponentially in multiple major cities of China with a lag time behind the Wuhan outbreak of about 1–2 weeks.\n\n\nInterpretation\nGiven that 2019-nCoV is no longer contained within Wuhan, other major Chinese cities are probably sustaining localised outbreaks.\n\n Large cities overseas with close transport links to China could also become outbreak epicentres, unless substantial public health interventions at both the population and personal levels are implemented immediately.\n\n Independent self-sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally could become inevitable because of substantial exportation of presymptomatic cases and in the absence of large-scale public health interventions.\n\n Preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be

effect of inefficient response is a potentially important contribution of epidemic theory.\n\n To develop this understanding we studied societal learning during emerging outbreaks wherein patient removal accelerates as information is gathered and disseminated.\n\n\nMethods and Findings\nWe developed an extension of a standard outbreak model, the simple stochastic epidemic, which accounts for societal learning.\n\n We obtained expressions for the expected outbreak size and the distribution of epidemic duration.\n\n We found that rapid learning noticeably affects the final outbreak size even when learning exhibits diminishing returns (relaxation).\n\n As an example, we estimated the learning rate for the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Singapore.\n\n Evidence for relaxation during the first eight weeks of the outbreak was inconclusive.\n\n We estimated that if societal learning had occurred at half the actual rate, the expected final size of the outbreak would have reached nearly 800 cases, more than three times the observed number of infections.\n\n By contrast, the expected outbreak size for societal learning twice as effective was 116 cases.\n\n\nConclusion\nThese results show that the rate of societal learning can greatly affect the final size of disease outbreaks, justifying investment in early warning systems and attentiveness to disease outbreak by both government authorities and the public.\n\n We submit that the burden of emerging infections, including the risk of a global pandemic, could be efficiently reduced by improving procedures for rapid detection of outbreaks, alerting public health officials, and aggressively educating the public at the start of an

As of 19 July, 137,232 cases of the H1N1 influenza strain have been officially confirmed in 142 different countries, and the pandemic unfolding in the Southern hemisphere is now under scrutiny to gain insights about the next winter wave in the Northern hemisphere.\n\n A major challenge is pre-empted by the need to estimate the transmission potential of the virus and to assess its dependence on seasonality aspects in order to be able to use numerical models capable of projecting the spatiotemporal pattern of the pandemic.\n\n\nMethods\nIn the present work, we use a global structured metapopulation model integrating mobility and transportation data worldwide.\n\n The model considers data on 3,362 subpopulations in 220 different countries and individual mobility across them.\n\n The model generates stochastic realizations of the epidemic evolution worldwide considering 6 billion individuals, from which we can gather information such as prevalence, morbidity, number of secondary cases and number and date of imported cases for each subpopulation, all with a time resolution of 1 day.\n\n In order to estimate the transmission potential and the relevant model parameters we used the data on the chronology of the 2009 novel influenza A(H1N1).\n\n The method is based on the maximum likelihood analysis of the arrival time distribution generated by the model in 12 countries seeded by Mexico by using 1 million computationally simulated epidemics.\n\n An extended chronology including 93 countries worldwide seeded before 18 June was used to ascertain the seasonality effects.\n\n\nResults\nWe found the best estimate R0 = 1.75 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.64 to 1.88) for the basic reproductive number.\n\n Correlation analysis allows the selection of the most probable seasonal behavior based on the observed pattern, leading to the identification of plausible scenarios for the future unfolding of the pandemic and the estimate of pandemic activity peaks in the different hemispheres.\n\n We provide estimates for the number of hospitalizations and the attack rate for the next wave as well as an extensive sensitivity analysis on the disease parameter values.\n\n We also studied the effect of systematic therapeutic use of antiviral drugs on the epidemic timeline.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe analysis shows the potential for an early epidemic peak occurring in October/November in the Northern hemisphere, likely before large-scale vaccination campaigns could be carried out.\n\n The baseline results refer to a worst-case scenario in which additional mitigation policies are not considered.\n\n We suggest that the planning of additional mitigation policies such as systematic antiviral treatments might be the key to delay the activity peak in order to restore the effectiveness of the vaccination programs.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2755471","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Duygu","surname":"Balcan","email":"balcand@indiana.edu","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hao","surname":"Hu","email":"hahu@indiana.edu","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Bruno","surname":"Goncalves","email":"bgoncalv@indiana.edu","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Paolo","surname":"Bajardi","email":"paolo.bajardi@isi.it","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chiara","surname":"Poletto","email":"chiara.poletto@isi.it","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jose J","surname":"Ramasco","email":"jramasco@isi.it","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Daniela","surname":"Paolotti","email":"daniela.paolotti@isi.it","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nicola","surname":"Perra","email":"nperra@indiana.edu","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Michele","surname":"Tizzoni","email":"michele.tizzoni@isi.it","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wouter Van den","surname":"Broeck","email":"wouter.vandenbroeck@isi.it","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Vittoria","surname":"Colizza","email":"vcolizza@isi.it","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alessandro","surname":"Vespignani","email":"alexv@indiana.edu","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The Economic Times, &quot;Nepal confirms first case of deadly coronavirus&quot;

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

transmission and control of COVID-19: a mathematical modelling study","abstract":"Background\nAn outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to 95?333 confirmed cases as of March 5, 2020. Understanding the early transmission dynamics of the infection and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures is crucial for assessing the potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas.\n\n Combining a mathematical model of severe SARS-CoV-2 transmission with four datasets from within and outside Wuhan, we estimated how transmission in Wuhan varied between December, 2019, and February, 2020. We used these estimates to assess the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission to occur in locations outside Wuhan if cases were introduced.\n\n\nMethods\nWe combined a stochastic transmission model with data on cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan and international cases that originated in Wuhan to estimate how transmission had varied over time during January, 2020, and February, 2020. Based on these estimates, we then calculated the probability that newly introduced cases might generate outbreaks in other areas.\n\n To estimate the early dynamics of transmission in Wuhan, we fitted a stochastic transmission dynamic model to multiple publicly available datasets on cases in Wuhan and internationally exported cases from Wuhan.\n\n The four datasets we fitted to were: daily number of new internationally exported cases (or lack thereof), by date of onset, as of Jan 26, 2020; daily number of new cases in Wuhan with no market exposure, by date of onset, between Dec 1, 2019, and Jan 1, 2020; daily number of new cases in China, by date of onset, between Dec 29, 2019, and Jan 23, 2020; and proportion of infected passengers on evacuation flights between Jan 29, 2020, and Feb 4, 2020. We used an additional two datasets for comparison with model outputs: daily number of new exported cases from Wuhan (or lack thereof) in countries with high connectivity to Wuhan (ie, top 20 most at-risk countries), by date of confirmation, as of Feb 10, 2020; and data on new confirmed cases reported in Wuhan between Jan 16, 2020, and Feb 11, 2020.\nFindings\nWe estimated that the median daily reproduction number (Rt) in Wuhan declined from 2·35 (95% CI 1·15–4·77) 1 week before travel restrictions were introduced on Jan 23, 2020, to 1·05 (0·41–2·39) 1 week after.\n\n Based on our estimates of Rt, assuming SARS-like variation, we calculated that in locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan in early January, once there are at least four independently introduced cases, there is a more than 50% chance the infection will establish within that population.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur results show that COVID-19 transmission probably declined in Wuhan during late January, 2020, coinciding with the introduction of travel control measures.\n\n As more cases arrive in international locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan before these control measures, it is likely many chains of transmission will fail to establish initially, but might lead to new outbreaks eventually.\n\n\nFunding\nWellcome Trust, Health Data Research UK, Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, and National Institute for Health Research.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7158569","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Science ;, The Lancet Pub.

COVID-19 differs from SARS in terms of infectious period, transmissibility, clinical severity, and extent of community spread.\n Even if traditional public health measures are not able to fully contain the outbreak of COVID-19, they will still be effective in reducing peak incidence and global deaths.\n Exportations to other countries need not result in rapid large-scale outbreaks, if countries have the political will to rapidly implement countermeasures.\n","id":"PMC7102636","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Annelies","surname":"Wilder-Smith","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Calvin J","surname":"Chiew","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Vernon J","surname":"Lee","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1101/2020.02.12.20022467","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The role of absolute humidity on transmission rates of the COVID-19 outbreak","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Seasonality of SARS-CoV-2: Will COVID-19 go away on its own in warmer weather?

broke out in Wuhan (China) and subsequently spread worldwide.\n\n Chloroquine has been sporadically used in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n Hydroxychloroquine shares the same mechanism of action as chloroquine, but its more tolerable safety profile makes it the preferred drug to treat malaria and autoimmune conditions.\n\n We propose that the immunomodulatory effect of hydroxychloroquine also may be useful in controlling the cytokine storm that occurs late-phase in critically ill SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.\n\n Currently, there is no evidence to support the use of hydroxychloroquine in SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n\nMethods\nThe pharmacological activity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine was tested using SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero cells.\n\n Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models (PBPK) were implemented for both drugs separately by integrating their in vitro data.\n\n Using the PBPK models, hydroxychloroquine concentrations in lung fluid were simulated under 5 different dosing regimens to explore the most effective regimen whilst considering the drug’s safety profile.\n\n\nResults\nHydroxychloroquine (EC50=0.72 ?M) was found to be more potent than chloroquine (EC50=5.47 ?M) in vitro.\n\n Based on PBPK models results, a loading dose of 400 mg twice daily of hydroxychloroquine sulfate given orally, followed by a maintenance dose of 200 mg given twice daily for 4 days is recommended for SARS-CoV-2 infection, as it reached three times the potency of chloroquine phosphate when given 500 mg twice daily 5 days in advance.\n\n\nConclusions\nHydroxychloroquine was found to

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in mainland China, outside Hubei province—the epicentre of the outbreak—had been reported.\n\n Since late January, massive public health interventions have been implemented nationwide to contain the outbreak.\n\n We provide an impact assessment of the transmissibility and severity of COVID-19 during the first wave in mainland Chinese locations outside Hubei.\n\n\nMethods\nWe estimated the instantaneous reproduction number (Rt) of COVID-19 in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Wenzhou, and the ten Chinese provinces that had the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases; and the confirmed case-fatality risk (cCFR) in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Wenzhou, and all 31 Chinese provinces.\n\n We used a susceptible–infectious–recovered model to show the potential effects of relaxing containment measures after the first wave of infection, in anticipation of a possible second wave.\n\n\nFindings\nIn all selected cities and provinces, the Rt decreased substantially since Jan 23, when control measures were implemented, and have since remained below 1. The cCFR outside Hubei was 0·98% (95% CI 0·82–1·16), which was almost five times lower than that in Hubei (5·91%, 5·73–6·09).\n\n Relaxing the interventions (resulting in Rt &gt;1) when the epidemic size was still small would increase the cumulative case count exponentially as a function of relaxation duration, even if aggressive interventions could subsequently push disease prevalence back to the baseline level.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe first wave of COVID-19 outside of Hubei has abated because of aggressive non-pharmaceutical interventions.\n\n However, given the substantial risk of viral reintroduction, particularly from overseas importation, close monitoring of Rt and cCFR is needed to inform strategies against a potential second wave to achieve an optimal balance between health and economic protection.\n\n\nFunding\nHealth and Medical Research Fund, Hong Kong, China.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7195331","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Kathy","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Joseph T","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Di","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gabriel M","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1126/science.abb4218","date":"2020-03-23","title":"The effect of human mobility and control measures on the COVID-19\nepidemic in China","abstract":"The ongoing COVID-19 outbreak expanded rapidly throughout China.\n Major\nbehavioral, clinical, and state interventions have been undertaken to mitigate\nthe epidemic and prevent the persistence of the virus in human populations in\nChina and worldwide.\n It remains unclear how these unprecedented interventions,\nincluding travel restrictions, affected COVID-19 spread in China.\n We use\nreal-time mobility data from Wuhan and detailed case data including travel\nhistory to elucidate the role of case importation on transmission in cities\nacross China and ascertain the impact of control measures.\n Early on, the spatial\ndistribution of COVID-19 cases in China was explained well by human mobility\ndata.\n Following the implementation of control measures, this correlation dropped\nand growth rates became negative in most locations, although shifts in the\ndemographics of reported cases were still indicative of local chains of\ntransmission outside Wuhan.\n This study shows that the drastic control measures\nimplemented in China substantially mitigated the spread of COVID-19.","id":"PMC7146642","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"American Association for the Advancement of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Moritz U.

this reduced the median number of infections by more than 92% (IQR 66–97) and 24% (13–90) in mid-2020 and end-2020, respectively.\n\n There are benefits to sustaining these measures until April in terms of delaying and reducing the height of the peak, median epidemic size at end-2020, and affording health-care systems more time to expand and respond.\n\n However, the modelled effects of physical distancing measures vary by the duration of infectiousness and the role school children have in the epidemic.\n\n\nInterpretation\nRestrictions on activities in Wuhan, if maintained until April, would probably help to delay the epidemic peak.\n\n Our projections suggest that premature and sudden lifting of interventions could lead to an earlier secondary peak, which could be flattened by relaxing the interventions gradually.\n\n However, there are limitations to our analysis, including large uncertainties around estimates of R0 and the duration of infectiousness.\n\n\nFunding\nBill &amp;

characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on

the severity of coronavirus disease 2019: a model-based analysis","abstract":"Background\nIn the face of rapidly changing data, a range of case fatality ratio estimates for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been produced that differ substantially in magnitude.\n\n We aimed to provide robust estimates, accounting for censoring and ascertainment biases.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected individual-case data for patients who died from COVID-19 in Hubei, mainland China (reported by national and provincial health commissions to Feb 8, 2020), and for cases outside of mainland China (from government or ministry of health websites and media reports for 37 countries, as well as Hong Kong and Macau, until Feb 25, 2020).\n\n These individual-case data were used to estimate the time between onset of symptoms and outcome (death or discharge from hospital).\n\n We next obtained age-stratified estimates of the case fatality ratio by relating the aggregate distribution of cases to the observed cumulative deaths in China, assuming a constant attack rate by age and adjusting for demography and age-based and location-based under-ascertainment.\n\n We also estimated the case fatality ratio from individual line-list data on 1334 cases identified outside of mainland China.\n\n Using data on the prevalence of PCR-confirmed cases in international residents repatriated from China, we obtained age-stratified estimates of the infection fatality ratio.\n\n Furthermore, data on age-stratified severity in a subset of 3665 cases from China were used to estimate the proportion of infected individuals who are likely to require hospitalisation.\n\n\nFindings\nUsing data on 24 deaths that occurred in mainland China and 165 recoveries outside of China, we estimated the mean duration from onset of symptoms to death to be 17·8 days (95% credible interval [CrI] 16·9–19·2) and to hospital discharge to be 24·7 days (22·9–28·1).\n\n In all laboratory confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases from mainland China (n=70?117), we estimated a crude case fatality ratio (adjusted for censoring) of 3·67% (95% CrI 3·56–3·80).\n\n However, after further adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment, we obtained a best estimate of the case fatality ratio in China of 1·38% (1·23–1·53), with substantially higher ratios in older age groups (0·32% [0·27–0·38] in those aged &lt;60 years vs 6·4% [5·7–7·2] in those aged ?60 years), up to 13·4% (11·2–15·9) in those aged 80 years or older.\n\n Estimates of case fatality ratio from international cases stratified by age were consistent with those from China (parametric estimate 1·4% [0·4–3·5] in those aged &lt;60 years [n=360] and 4·5% [1·8–11·1] in those aged ?60 years [n=151]).\n\n Our estimated overall infection fatality ratio for China was 0·66% (0·39–1·33), with an increasing profile with age.\n\n Similarly, estimates of the proportion of infected individuals likely to be hospitalised increased with age up to a maximum of 18·4% (11·0–37·6) in those aged 80 years or older.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThese early estimates give an indication of the fatality ratio across the spectrum of COVID-19 disease and show a strong age gradient in risk of death.\n\n\nFunding\nUK Medical Research Council.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7158570","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Science ;, The Lancet Pub.

the pneumonia outbreak caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were based on information from the general population.\n\n Limited data are available for pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in pregnancy and the intrauterine vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 infection.\n\n\nMethods\nClinical records, laboratory results, and chest CT scans were retrospectively reviewed for nine pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia (ie, with maternal throat swab samples that were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) who were admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, from Jan 20 to Jan 31, 2020. Evidence of intrauterine vertical transmission was assessed by testing for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in amniotic fluid, cord blood, and neonatal throat swab samples.\n\n Breastmilk samples were also collected and tested from patients after the first lactation.\n\n\nFindings\nAll nine patients had a caesarean section in their third trimester.\n\n Seven patients presented with a fever.\n\n Other symptoms, including cough (in four of nine patients), myalgia (in three), sore throat (in two), and malaise (in two), were also observed.\n\n Fetal distress was monitored in two cases.\n\n Five of nine patients had lymphopenia (&lt;1·0?×?10? cells per L).\n\n Three patients had increased aminotransferase concentrations.\n\n None of the patients developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died, as of Feb 4, 2020. Nine livebirths were recorded.\n\n No neonatal asphyxia was observed in newborn babies.\n\n All nine livebirths had a 1-min Apgar score of 8–9 and a 5-min Apgar score of 9–10. Amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk samples from six patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and all samples tested negative for the virus.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe clinical characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women were similar to those reported for non-pregnant adult patients who developed COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n Findings from this small group of cases suggest that there is currently no evidence for intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission in women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy.\n\n\nFunding\nHubei Science and

the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41

The majority of individuals with coronavirus experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without specific treatment. However, the elderly and people with underlying medical problems are at a higher risk of sever prognosis. A model-based analysis estimated that the case fatality ratio in China was 1.38%, and up to 13.4% in individuals aged 80 years or older. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) categorized COVID-19 as a pandemic, because the number of cases increased drastically outside China. As of April 10, 2020, there have been almost 1.5 million confirmed cases in 184 countries/regions, and over 92,000 deaths worldwide.\nResearch has reported that seasonal cyclicity is a ubiquitous feature of acute infectious diseases, which is also commonly observed in respiratory viral diseases. For instance, influenza outbreaks occur every winter in temperate regions. An epidemiological model in the United States indicated that absolute humidity affected the seasonality of influenza incidence. Moreover, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) broke out in China in mid-November 2002, and had almost entirely resolved by July 2003. A study in China that was based on case studies in Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Beijing, and Taiyuan indicated that the outbreaks of SARS were significantly associated with variations in temperature.\nEmerging laboratory and epidemiological data suggest that environmental conditions may affect the current COVID-19 pandemic. A published laboratory study by reported that SARS-CoV-2 was highly stable at 4  C but sensitive to heat. The virus survival time was shortened to 5 min as the incubation temperature increased to 70  C. Epidemiological studies have explored the relationship between COVID-19 and meteorological parameters; however, findings are controversial. A study by reported that a 1  C rise was associated with a 4.861% increase in the daily confirmed cases of COVID-19, when mean temperature (lag 0-14) was below 3  C. A study by reported a positive association between daily deaths of COVID-19 and diurnal temperature range, and a negative association for relative humidity. However, a study by reported that COVID-19 transmission did not exhibit an association with temperature in Chinese cities.\nCOVID-19 continues to spread globally, and a second wave of COVID-19 appears probable thus, the effect of meteorological parameters on the spread of COVID-19 should be explored to help predict the development over the coming months, although numerous factors may affect the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, this study explored the effects of temperature and humidity on the daily new cases and deaths of COVID-19 in 166 countries using a generalized additive model (GAM), to provide useful implications for policymakers and the public.\nMethods\nData collection\nData of COVID-19 cases were collected in 166 countries (excluding China) as of March 27, 2020 for analysis. Data, including daily new cases and daily new deaths, were collected from the WHO daily COVID-19 situation reports (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports).\nThe monitoring stations nearest to each country's capital were used. Daily meteorological data, including daily average temperature, average dew point, and average wind speed, were obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Center (https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/search/data-search/global-summary-of-the-day).\nCalculation of relative humidity\nRelative humidity is the ratio of the actual water vapor pressure to the saturation water vapor pressure at the prevailing temperature, calculated using the following equation:where E (hPa) donates the vapor pressure of air at temperature t( C). Ew (hPa) donates the saturated vapor pressure of the pure horizontal liquid surface at dry bulb temperature t ( C). The dew point is the temperature at which air must be cooled to become saturated with water vapor. The actual vapor pressure E can be calculated using the dew point temperature and the saturated vapor pressure can be calculated from the actual temperature using the Magnus formula for saturation water vapor pressure:where E0 denotes saturation vapor pressure at a reference temperature T0 (273.15 K) which equals 6.11 mb. A is a constant of 17.43 and B is a constant of 240.73. t ( C) is the actual temperature or dew point.\nControl variables\nFive variables were included in the model as potential confounders: wind speed (https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/search/data-search/global-summary-of-the-day), median age of the national population (https://ourworldindata.org/age-structure2019), Global Health Security Index (GHSI, https://www.ghsindex.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/2019-Global-Health-Security-Index.pdf), Human Development Index (HDI, http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdr2019.pdf) and population density (https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/countries-by-density/). Wind is a crucial factor in the transmission of respiratory infectious diseases and it may modulate the dynamics of various vectors and pathogens. Median age of the national population is an indicator of population aging; the incidence of severe cases is higher in countries with higher levels of population aging. GHSI is the first comprehensive assessment of global health security capabilities to be employed in 195 countries; the 2019 GHSI report scored (out of 100) the country-level capacity for &quot;early detection and reporting for epidemics of potential concern.&quot; HDI is a summary measure of average achievement in three key dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, being knowledgeable and have a decent standard of living. Population density is expressed as the number of people per square mile of land area; a high population density can promote the spread of epidemics.\nStatistical methods\nIn the present study, 166 countries with confirmed cases as of March 27, 2020 were included. Descriptive analyses were performed for all the data. A log-linear GAM was used to analyze the associations between meteorological factors (temperature and relative humidity) and daily new cases and daily new deaths of COVID-19. First, the basic models were constructed, including meteorological factors (temperature and relative humidity). Second, the variables were controlled to adjust for regional variation, including wind speed, median age of the population, GHSI, and country. Third, the day-of-week and the penalized smoothing spline functions were incorporated to control the time trend and cycle. The core GAM equation was as follows:where t is the day of the observation. Considering that the number of daily new cases or daily new deaths in some countries is 0, Y t is the number of daily new cases or daily new deaths on day t plus one. alpha is the intercept; beta is the regression coefficient; X t is the weather variables on day t; Wind is the wind speed; Country is a categorical variable for country; Median.Age is the median age of each countries' population; GHSI is the Global Health Security Index; DOW is a categorical variable indicating the date of the week; s() refers to the smoother, which is based on the penalized smoothing spline; Time is the date of the observation; df is the degree of freedom.\nThe lag effects of weather conditions on daily new cases and daily new deaths of COVID-19 were then considered using single lag days (lag 0, 1, 2, 3). The cumulative effects of average exposure over multiple days were then assessed using additional analyses (lag 01, 02, 03) to control for the possible misalignment of a single lag day exposure.\nAll analyses were performed using R software (version 3.6.0) with the &quot;mgcv&quot; package (version 1.8-28). The results were expressed as percentage changes and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) in daily new cases and daily new deaths of COVID-19 associated with a 1 unit increase in weather variables. All tests were two-sided, and a value P &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nSensitivity analysis\nTwo other variables were included in the sensitivity analysis: HDI and population density. Because of the inconsistent outbreak time of COVID-19 in different countries, the transmission mechanism and transmission rate of COVID-19 may differ. Therefore, countries that first reported case relatively early and countries with more cases were selected to fit the core model to determine the stability of results.\nResults\nDescription analysis\nAs of March 27th 2020, distribution of (A) mean temperature and (B) mean relative humidity with the average growth rate of daily new cases and daily new deaths of COVID-19 worldwide.\nNote: Mean temperature ( C) was the sum of the daily average temperature divided by the number of observed days. Mean relative humidity (%) was the sum of the daily average relative humidity divided by the number of observed days. Average growth rate was the average of the natural logarithm of the number of daily new cases or daily new deaths.\nFig. 1\nA total of 509,164 cumulative confirmed cases and 23,335 deaths had been documented globally as of March 27, 2020. Italy, the United States and Spain were the three countries with the most cases of COVID-19 outside of China. Moreover, Italy, Spain and Iran had the most deaths of COVID-19 outside of China. The average temperatures ranged from -5.28 to 34.30  C, and the average relative humidity ranged from 11.39% to 88.42% (Fig. 1 ).\nEffects of temperature and humidity on daily new cases and daily new deaths of COVID-19\nEffects of temperature and relative humidity on daily new cases and daily new deaths of COVID-19 in different lag structures.\nFig. 2\nAfter controlling the effects of potential confounders, temperature and relative humidity were both negatively related to the daily new cases and daily new deaths. A 1  C increase in temperature was associated with a 3.08% (95% CI: 1.53%, 4.63%) reduction in daily new cases and a 1.19% (95% CI: 0.44%, 1.95%) reduction in daily new deaths. A 1% increase in relative humidity was associated with a 0.85% (95% CI: 0.51%, 1.19%) reduction in daily new cases and a 0.51% (95% CI: 0.34%, 0.67%) reduction in daily new deaths. Different lag structures also indicated that temperature and relative humidity were negatively correlated with daily new cases and daily new deaths (Fig. 2 ). The strongest cumulative effects were observed at lag 03, with a 1  C increase in temperature being associated with a 5.94% and 2.30% reduction in daily new cases and daily new deaths, respectively, a 1% increase in relative humidity being associated with a 1.23% and 0.88% reduction in daily new cases and daily new deaths, respectively.\nSensitivity analysis\nEstimated changes with 95% confidence intervals in daily new cases and daily new deaths percentage change (%) associated with each 1 unit increase in temperature and relative humidity, after controlling the HDI and population density.\nTable 1	 	\nVariables	Daily new cases	Daily new deaths	 	beta	95%CI	P	beta	95%CI	P	 	Temperature ( C)	-2.85%	-4.40%	-1.31%	&lt;0.01	-0.65%	-1.40%	0.099%	0.089	 	Relative humidity (%)	-0.87%	-1.22%	-0.53%	&lt;0.01	-0.46%	-0.63%	-0.29%	&lt;0.01	 	\nTwo indicators of HDI and population density were adjusted based on the core model. The results revealed that a 1  C increase in temperature was associated with a 2.85% reduction in daily new cases and no association with daily new deaths. A 1% increase in relative humidity was associated with a 0.87% reduction in daily new cases and a 0.46% reduction in daily new deaths (Table 1 ).\nEstimated changes with 95% confidence intervals in daily new cases and daily new deaths percentage change (%) associated with each 1 unit increase in temperature and relative humidity among countries with over 10 days since the first reported case and countries with over 100 cumulative cases.\nTable 2	 	\nCountries	Variables	Daily new cases	Daily new deaths	 	beta	95%CI	P	beta	95%CI	P	 	Over 10 days since the first reported case	Temperature ( C)	-3.05%	-4.63%	-1.47%	&lt;0.01	-1.22%	-2.00%	-0.45%	&lt;0.01	 	Relative humidity (%)	-0.87%	-1.21%	-0.52%	&lt;0.01	-0.51%	-0.68%	-0.34%	&lt;0.01	 	Over 100 cumulative cases	Temperature ( C)	-2.82%	-4.60%	-1.03%	&lt;0.01	-1.25%	-2.16%	-0.34%	&lt;0.01	 	Relative humidity (%)	-0.86%	-1.25%	-0.47%	&lt;0.01	-0.53%	-0.73%	-0.33%	&lt;0.01	 	\nThe cumulative number of cases and the outbreak time of COVID-19 exhibited a large variation between countries; thus the transmission mode and rate of COVID-19 differ between countries. We selected countries that reported their first case over 10 days before data collection and countries with over 100 cumulative cases to fit the core model. Among countries with over 10 days since the first reported case, a 1  C increase in temperature was associated with a 3.05% and 1.22% reduction in daily new cases and daily new deaths, respectively, and a 1% increase in relative humidity was associated with a 0.87% and 0.51% reduction in daily new cases and daily new deaths, respectively. In countries with over 100 cumulative cases, a 1  C increase in temperature was associated with a 2.82% and 1.25% reduction in daily new cases and daily new deaths, respectively; a 1% increase in relative humidity was associated with a 0.86% and 0.53% reduction in daily new cases and daily new deaths, respectively. The results of the comparisons of these datasets with the total data were not significant. These results demonstrate a robust effect of temperature and relative humidity on daily new cases and new deaths of COVID-19 (Table 2 ).\nDiscussion\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is the defining global health crisis of our time and the greatest challenge facing the world. Our findings revealed that temperature and humidity were inversely correlated with daily new cases and deaths of COVID-19. For every 1  C increase in temperature, daily new cases of COVID-19 reduced by 3.08% (95% CI: 1.53%, 4.63%) and daily new deaths reduced by 1.19% (95% CI: 0.44%, 1.95%); for every 1% increase in humidity, daily new cases of COVID-19 reduced by 0.85% (95% CI: 0.51%, 1.19%), and daily new deaths reduced by 0.51% (95% CI: 0.34%, 0.67%), according to analyses of 166 countries. After adjusting for potential factors and lag days, the negative relationships remained robust. Furthermore, we hypothesized that the effects of temperature and humidity on daily cases and deaths of COVID-19 may not be evident in countries where the community transmission of COVID-19 had not occurred because the proportion of imported cases was high. Therefore, countries where the time of onset was fewer than 10 days prior, or countries with fewer than 100 cumulative confirmed cases were excluded in the sensitivity analysis. The model-fitting results remained stable.\nFew studies have investigated the association of temperature and humidity with COVID-19 incidence and death rates. A preprint study, which investigated the total confirmed cases in 429 cities globally from January 20 to February 4, 2020 indicated that the cumulative number of confirmed cases reduced by 0.86 for every 1  C increase in the minimum temperature of higher-temperature cities. Another preprint study by reported that as of February 29, 2020, average temperature increases of 1  C were negatively correlated with the predicted number of cases worldwide (excluding Hubei Province). Furthermore, a study reported that relative humidity was inversely related to daily deaths of COVID-19 (r = -0.32), with the largest reduction in lag 3 [-11.41% (95% CI: -19.68%, -2.29%)]. These results accord with our findings.\nOther studies have reported conflicting results. A study in 122 cities in China demonstrated that when the mean temperature (lag 0-14) was below 3  C, the daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 increased by 4.861% (95% CI: 3.209, 6.513%) for every 1  C rise in temperature. However, no correlations were observed when the mean temperature was above 3  C. Another study investigated the daily deaths of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, from January 20 to February 29, 2020, which revealed that diurnal temperature ranges were positively correlated with daily COVID-19 deaths (r = 0.44). However, these results were not stable, because the temperature was related to the reduction in COVID-19 deaths in lag 3 [-7.50% (95% CI: -10.99%, -3.88%)] and lag 5. These studies did not report the same trends as our study, which may be because of the different characteristics of the participants and different models. The conflicting study was only conducted in China and the temperature range was limited, whereas our study analyzed several countries.\nThere are several possible explanations for our findings. Firstly, studies have reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to high temperature and humidity. A laboratory study by demonstrated a 0.7 log-unit reduction after 14 days of incubation in the virus transport medium at 4  C (final concentration ~ 6.8 log-unit of 50% tissue culture infectious dose per mL); over 3 log-unit reduction after 7 days of incubation at 22  C, and no virus detected at 14 days; over 3 log-unit reduction after 1 day of incubation at 37  C, and no detection afterward. Moreover, a study by demonstrated that under experimental conditions, the stability of SARS-CoV-2 was similar to that of SARS-CoV. reported that at temperatures of 22-25  C and relative humidity of 40%-50%, dried SARS-CoV could survive for over 5 days on smooth surfaces. However, the viability of SARS-CoV reduced rapidly when the temperature or relative humidity increased. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 may be less stable in high-temperature and high-humidity environments. Second, the moisture in the exhaled bioaerosols evaporates rapidly in low relative humidity, forming droplet nuclei that remain in the air for longer, thereby increasing the likelihood of pathogen transmission. Third, the cold weather in winter hinders humans' innate immunity. Cold temperatures cause reduced blood supply and thus reduce the provision of immune cells to the nasal mucosa. Moreover, low humidity reduces the airway cilia cells' ability to remove virus particles, secrete mucus, and repair airway cells, thus exposing the host to the virus. During viral infections, cells release signal proteins to alert neighboring cells of the danger of virus invasion. However, this innate immune defense system is compromised in low-humidity environments. Therefore, the human body is at a higher risk of infection by viruses in low-temperature and low-humidity environments.\nMost respiratory viruses exhibit a seasonal trend of infection, such as the influenza virus, SARS-CoV. In 2019, a study by demonstrated that the respiratory syncytial virus and influenza A virus exhibited obvious seasonality, peaking in November-December and December-January, respectively. In 2010, analyzed samples from 11,661 patients with respiratory tract infection from Edinburgh Hospital. This study reported that three types of coronavirus (HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-OC43) had significant winter seasonality, mainly causing infection between December and April, which is similar to the transmission pattern of influenza. In 2005, analyzed the potential effect of environmental factors on the SARS epidemic in Hong Kong. The results revealed that temperature was significantly correlated with the spread of SARS after adjustment for several factors, including various interventions, the number of medical staffs infected, the number of patients in intensive care units. The risk of increased daily incidence of SARS in lower temperatures was 18.18-fold (95% CI: 5.6, 8.8) higher than that in higher temperatures. These studies indicate that SARS-CoV-2 may have a similar seasonal trend to other respiratory viruses, and high temperature may inhibit its spread.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is currently displaying an even more adverse trend. The future growth trend of COVID-19 has attracted considerable attention as the northern hemisphere enters summer. Our results suggest that the growth rate of COVID-19 may slow with an increase in temperature and humidity. However, COVID-19 is in a stage of high infectivity and rapid transmission. The latest study estimated that the basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19 was approximately 5.7 (95% CI: 3.8-8.9). Furthermore, confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the African equatorial and Amazon rainforest regions; therefore, the effect of temperature and humidity on COVID-19 transmission is not sufficient to fully inhibit the pandemic. Countries must take active measures to control the first pandemic and prevent a second wave of COVID-19.\nThe advantages of this study are as follows. First, all countries in which COVID-19 cases had been reported, as of March 27, 2020, were included in our study; thus the results reflect the global COVID-19 situation. Second, this study was a time series analysis, which eliminated the long-term trend of the COVID-19 epidemic, and daily meteorological data were used to accurately reflect the effect of temperature and humidity on the daily new cases and daily new deaths of COVID-19. Third, this study further included variables that reflected economic level, medical conditions, population aging, and population density to reduce confounding bias.\nHowever, several limitations must be considered. First, the dates of reporting from the WHO daily COVID-19 situation reports were used instead of the date of onset in our study, which may engender bias because the time interval varied depending on the medical conditions, policy formulation and diagnostic criteria of each country. Second, the number of confirmed cases was inevitably underestimated, especially in low-income regions, because of the low detection coverage of COVID-19. Third, the effects of policies and measures on COVID-19 transmission were not assessed in our study; however, certain measures, such as quarantine, may affect the prevalence of infectious diseases. Finally, ecological fallacies may have arisen as a result of using the temperature and humidity of the capitals to reflect the national mean temperature and humidity, and using outdoor exposure as a proxy for personal exposure.\nConclusions\nThese findings provide preliminary evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic may be partially suppressed with temperature and humidity increases. However, active measures must be taken to control the source of infection, block transmission and prevent further spread of COVID-19.\nAbbreviations\nCOVID-19\nCorona Virus Disease 2019\nSARS-CoV-2\nsevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\nWHO\nWorld Health Organization\nGAM\ngeneralized additive model\nGHSI\nGlobal Health Security Index\nHDI\nHuman Development Index\nCIs\nconfidence intervals\nEthical approval and consent to participate\nNot applicable.\nAvailability of supporting data\nThe datasets used and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the websites.\nFunding\nThis work was supported by  [grant number 2020YFC0846300] and The  [grant number 71934002].\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n Yu Wu:Writing - original draft, Methodology, Software, Data curation.Wenzhan Jing:Writing - review &amp; editing, Visualization.Jue Liu:Writing - review &amp; editing, Supervision, Methodology.Qiuyue Ma:Data curation, Methodology, Validation.Jie Yuan:Data curation, Investigation.Yaping Wang:Data curation, Investigation.Min Du:Data curation, Investigation.Min Liu:Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Supervision. \nDeclaration of competing interest\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.\nReferences\nPreliminary evidence that higher temperatures are associated with lower incidence of COVID-19, for cases reported globally up to 29th February 2020\nFalecimento de indigena Kokama por coronavirus\nThe effects of temperature and relative humidity on the viability of the SARS coronavirus\nCorrection, derivation and application of saturated water vapor pressure empirical formula\nStability of SARS-CoV-2 in different environmental conditions\nCOVID-19 pandemicHumanity needs leadership andsolidarity to defeat the coronavirus\nAerosol and surface stability of SARS-CoV-2 as compared with SARS-CoV-1\nWind: a neglected factor in the spread of infectious diseases\nEpidemiology and clinical presentations of the four human coronaviruses 229E, HKU1, NL63, and OC43 detected over 3 years using a novel multiplex real-time PCR method\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus: the species and its viruses - a statement of the Coronavirus Study Group\nClinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 in China\nCoronavirus Resource Center\nDo weather conditions influence the transmission of the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)?\nInterpreting COVID-19 and Virtual Care Trends: Cohort Study\nLow ambient humidity impairs barrier function and innate resistance against influenza infection\nFirst-wave COVID-19 transmissibility and severity in China outside Hubei after control measures, and second-wave scenario planning: a modelling impact assessment\nEnvironmental factors on the SARS epidemic: air temperature, passage of time and multiplicative effect of hospital infection\nInfluenza virus transmission is dependent on relative humidity and temperature\nEffects of temperature variation and humidity on the death of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China\nThe calendar of epidemics: seasonal cycles of infectious diseases\nDiagnosis and treatment protocol for novel coronavirus pneumonia (trial version 7)\nAssociation between viral seasonality and meteorological factors\nThe National Morbidity, Mortality, and Air Pollution Study.

natural sunlight may be effective as a disinfectant for contaminated nonporous materials.\n","id":"PMC7313905","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Oxford University

2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and

spreading across the world.\n\n As of March 26, 2020, there are more than 500,000 cases and more than 25,000 deaths related to COVID-19, and the numbers are increasing by the hour.\n\n\nObjective\nThe aim of this study was to explore the trends in confirmed COVID-19 cases in North Carolina, and to understand patterns in virtual visits related to symptoms of COVID-19.\nMethods\nWe conducted a cohort study of confirmed COVID-19 cases and patients using an on-demand, statewide virtual urgent care center.\n\n We collected data from February 1, 2020, to March 15, 2020. Institutional Review Board exemption was obtained prior to the study.\n\n\nResults\nAs of March, 18 2020, there were 92 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 733 total virtual visits.\n\n Of the total visits, 257 (35.1%) were related to COVID-19-like symptoms.\n\n Of the COVID-19-like visits, the number of females was 178 (69.2%).\n\n People in the age groups of 30-39 years (n=67, 26.1%) and 40-49 years (n=64, 24.9%) were half of the total patients.\n\n Additionally, approximately 96.9% (n=249) of the COVID-like encounters came from within the state of North Carolina.\n\n Our study shows that virtual care can provide efficient triaging in the counties with the highest number of COVID-19 cases.\n\n We also confirmed that the largest spread of the disease occurs in areas with a high population density as well as in areas with major airports.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe use of virtual care presents promising potential in the fight against COVID-19. Virtual care is capable of reducing emergency room visits, conserving health care resources, and avoiding the spread of COVID-19 by treating patients remotely.\n\n We call for further adoption of virtual care by health systems across the United States and the world during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7162649","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"JMIR Publications","authors":[{"firstname":"Yousef","surname":"Khader","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gunther","surname":"Eysenbach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Travis","surname":"Sanchez","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Danielle","surname":"McCarthy","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Danielle","surname":"McCarthy","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Pablo","surname":"Valente","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Saif","surname":"Khairat","email":"saif@unc.edu","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Saif","surname":"Khairat","email":"saif@unc.edu","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chenlu","surname":"Meng","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Chenlu","surname":"Meng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuxuan","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Yuxuan","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Barbara","surname":"Edson","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Barbara","surname":"Edson","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Robert","surname":"Gianforcaro","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Robert","surname":"Gianforcaro","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMe2002387","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Covid-19 — Navigating the Uncharted","abstract":"","id":"PMC7121221","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical Society","authors":[{"firstname":"Anthony S.","surname":"Fauci","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"H.

outside Hubei after control measures, and second-wave scenario planning: a modelling impact assessment","abstract":"Background\nAs of March 18, 2020, 13?415 confirmed cases and 120 deaths related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in mainland China, outside Hubei province—the epicentre of the outbreak—had been reported.\n\n Since late January, massive public health interventions have been implemented nationwide to contain the outbreak.\n\n We provide an impact assessment of the transmissibility and severity of COVID-19 during the first wave in mainland Chinese locations outside Hubei.\n\n\nMethods\nWe estimated the instantaneous reproduction number (Rt) of COVID-19 in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Wenzhou, and the ten Chinese provinces that had the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases; and the confirmed case-fatality risk (cCFR) in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Wenzhou, and all 31 Chinese provinces.\n\n We used a susceptible–infectious–recovered model to show the potential effects of relaxing containment measures after the first wave of infection, in anticipation of a possible second wave.\n\n\nFindings\nIn all selected cities and provinces, the Rt decreased substantially since Jan 23, when control measures were implemented, and have since remained below 1. The cCFR outside Hubei was 0·98% (95% CI 0·82–1·16), which was almost five times lower than that in Hubei (5·91%, 5·73–6·09).\n\n Relaxing the interventions (resulting in Rt &gt;1) when the epidemic size was still small would increase the cumulative case count exponentially as a function of relaxation duration, even if aggressive interventions could subsequently push disease prevalence back to the baseline level.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe first wave of COVID-19 outside of Hubei has abated because of aggressive non-pharmaceutical interventions.\n\n However, given the substantial risk of viral reintroduction, particularly from overseas importation, close monitoring of Rt and cCFR is needed to inform strategies against a potential second wave to achieve an optimal balance between health and economic protection.\n\n\nFunding\nHealth and Medical Research Fund, Hong Kong, China.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7195331","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

mathematical modelling study","abstract":"Background\nAn outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to 95?333 confirmed cases as of March 5, 2020. Understanding the early transmission dynamics of the infection and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures is crucial for assessing the potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas.\n\n Combining a mathematical model of severe SARS-CoV-2 transmission with four datasets from within and outside Wuhan, we estimated how transmission in Wuhan varied between December, 2019, and February, 2020. We used these estimates to assess the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission to occur in locations outside Wuhan if cases were introduced.\n\n\nMethods\nWe combined a stochastic transmission model with data on cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan and international cases that originated in Wuhan to estimate how transmission had varied over time during January, 2020, and February, 2020. Based on these estimates, we then calculated the probability that newly introduced cases might generate outbreaks in other areas.\n\n To estimate the early dynamics of transmission in Wuhan, we fitted a stochastic transmission dynamic model to multiple publicly available datasets on cases in Wuhan and internationally exported cases from Wuhan.\n\n The four datasets we fitted to were: daily number of new internationally exported cases (or lack thereof), by date of onset, as of Jan 26, 2020; daily number of new cases in Wuhan with no market exposure, by date of onset, between Dec 1, 2019, and Jan 1, 2020; daily number of new cases in China, by date of onset, between Dec 29, 2019, and Jan 23, 2020; and proportion of infected passengers on evacuation flights between Jan 29, 2020, and Feb 4, 2020. We used an additional two datasets for comparison with model outputs: daily number of new exported cases from Wuhan (or lack thereof) in countries with high connectivity to Wuhan (ie, top 20 most at-risk countries), by date of confirmation, as of Feb 10, 2020; and data on new confirmed cases reported in Wuhan between Jan 16, 2020, and Feb 11, 2020.\nFindings\nWe estimated that the median daily reproduction number (Rt) in Wuhan declined from 2·35 (95% CI 1·15–4·77) 1 week before travel restrictions were introduced on Jan 23, 2020, to 1·05 (0·41–2·39) 1 week after.\n\n Based on our estimates of Rt, assuming SARS-like variation, we calculated that in locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan in early January, once there are at least four independently introduced cases, there is a more than 50% chance the infection will establish within that population.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur results show that COVID-19 transmission probably declined in Wuhan during late January, 2020, coinciding with the introduction of travel control measures.\n\n As more cases arrive in international locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan before these control measures, it is likely many chains of transmission will fail to establish initially, but might lead to new outbreaks eventually.\n\n\nFunding\nWellcome Trust, Health Data Research UK, Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, and National Institute for Health Research.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7158569","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Science ;, The Lancet Pub.

host, we show that aerosol spread of influenza virus is dependent upon both ambient relative humidity and temperature.\n Twenty experiments performed at relative humidities from 20% to 80% and 5 °C, 20 °C, or 30 °C indicated that both cold and dry conditions favor transmission.\n The relationship between transmission via aerosols and relative humidity at 20 °C is similar to that previously reported for the stability of influenza viruses (except at high relative humidity, 80%), implying that the effects of humidity act largely at the level of the virus particle.\n For infected guinea pigs housed at 5 °C, the duration of peak shedding was approximately 40 h longer than that of animals housed at 20 °C; this increased shedding likely accounts for the enhanced transmission seen at 5 °C.\n To investigate the mechanism permitting prolonged viral growth, expression levels in the upper respiratory tract of several innate immune mediators were determined.\n Innate responses proved to be comparable between animals housed at 5 °C and 20 °C, suggesting that cold temperature (5 °C) does not impair the innate immune response in this system.\n Although the seasonal epidemiology of influenza is well characterized, the underlying reasons for predominant wintertime spread are not clear.\n We provide direct, experimental evidence to support the role of weather conditions in the

Three methodologies were used to evaluate the isolated association: time-series analysis using Poisson regression model, bidirectional case-crossover analysis matched by period, and case-crossover analysis matched by the confounding factor, i.\n\ne.\n\n, average temperature or pollutant concentration.\n\n The graphical representation of the response surface, generated by the interaction term between these factors added to the Poisson regression model, was interpreted to evaluate the synergistic effect of the risk factors.\n\n\nRESULTS\nNo differences were observed between the results of the case-crossover and time-series analyses.\n\n The percentage change in the relative risk of cardiovascular and respiratory mortality was 0.85% (0.45;1.25) and 1.60% (0.74;2.46), respectively, due to an increase of 10 ?g/m3 in the PM10 concentration.\n\n The pattern of correlation of the temperature with cardiovascular mortality was U-shaped and that with respiratory mortality was J-shaped, indicating an increased relative risk at high temperatures.\n\n The values for the interaction term indicated a higher relative risk for cardiovascular and respiratory mortalities at low temperatures and high temperatures, respectively, when the pollution levels reached approximately 60 ?g/m3.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe positive association standardized in the Poisson regression model for pollutant concentration is not confounded by temperature, and the effect of temperature is not confounded by the pollutant levels in the time-series analysis.\n\n The simultaneous exposure to different levels of environmental factors can create synergistic effects that are as disturbing as those caused by extreme concentrations.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4285836","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Faculdade de Saúde Pública da Universidade de São Paulo","authors":[{"firstname":"Samya de Lara Lins de

2003 SARS epidemic","abstract":"Since the emergence of HIV/AIDS in the 1980s, social scientists and sociologists of health and illness have been exploring the metaphorical framing of this infectious disease in its social context.\n Many have focused on the militaristic language used to report and explain this illness, a type of language that has permeated discourses of immunology, bacteriology and infection for at least a century.\n In this article, we examine how language and metaphor were used in the UK media's coverage of another previously unknown and severe infectious disease: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).\n SARS offers an opportunity to explore the cultural framing of a less extraordinary epidemic disease.\n It therefore provides an analytical counter-weight to the very extensive body of interpretation that has developed around HIV/AIDS.\n By analysing the total reporting on SARS of five major national newspapers during the epidemic of spring 2003, we investigate how the reporting of SARS in the UK press was framed, and how this related to media, public and governmental responses to the disease.\n We found that, surprisingly, militaristic language was largely absent, as was the judgemental discourse of plague.\n Rather, the main conceptual metaphor used was SARS as a killer.\n SARS as a killer was a single unified entity, not an army or force.\n We provide some tentative explanations for this shift in linguistic framing by relating it to local political concerns, media cultures, and spatial factors.\n","id":"PMC7117051","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

Publication of these data will allow for quantification of the effect of proximity to one or more such plant on cancer and all-cause mortality observed in nearby towns.\n\n However, as errors have been detected in the geocoding of many of the pollutant foci shown in the EPER, it was decided that a validation study should be conducted into the accuracy of these co-ordinates.\n\n EPER-Spain geographic co-ordinates were drawn from the European Environment Agency (EEA) server and the Spanish Ministry of the Environment (MOE).\n\n The Farm Plot Geographic Information System (Sistema de Información Geográfica de Parcelas Agrícolas) (SIGPAC) enables orthophotos (digitalized aerial images) of any territorial point across Spain to be obtained.\n\n Through a search of co-ordinates in the SIGPAC, all the industrial foci (except farms) were located.\n\n The quality criteria used to ascertain possible errors in industrial location were high, medium and low quality, where industries were situated at a distance of less than 500 metres, more than 500 metres but less than 1 kilometre, and more than 1 kilometre from their real locations, respectively.\n\n\nResults\nInsofar as initial registry quality was concerned, 84% of industrial complexes were inaccurately positioned (low quality) according to EEA data versus 60% for Spanish MOE data.\n\n The distribution of the distances between the original and corrected co-ordinates for each of the industries on the registry revealed that the median error was 2.55 kilometres for Spain overall (according to EEA data).\n\n The Autonomous Regions that displayed most errors in industrial geocoding were Murcia, Canary Islands, Andalusia and Madrid.\n\n Correct co-ordinates were successfully allocated to 100% of EPER-Spain industries.\n\n\nConclusion\nKnowing the exact location of pollutant foci is vital to obtain reliable and valid conclusions in any study where distance to the focus is a decisive factor, as in the case of the consequences of industrial pollution on the health of neighbouring populations.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2254386","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

of Zoonotic Cutaneous Leishmaniasis in Central Tunisia","abstract":"Background\nOld world Zoonotic Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (ZCL) is a vector-borne human disease caused by Leishmania major, a unicellular eukaryotic parasite transmitted by pool blood-feeding sand flies mainly to wild rodents, such as Psammomys obesus.\n\n The human beings who share the rodent and sand fly habitats can be subverted as both sand fly blood resource.\n\n ZCL is endemic in the Middle East, Central Asia, Subsaharan and North Africa.\n\n Like other vector-borne diseases, the incidence of ZCL displayed by humans varies with environmental and climate factors.\n\n However, so far no study has addressed the temporal dynamics or the impact of climate factors on the ZCL risk.\n\n\nPrincipal Findings\nSeasonality during the same epidemiologic year and interval between ZCL epidemics ranging from 4 to 7 years were demonstrated.\n\n Models showed that ZCL incidence is raising i) by 1.8% (95% confidence intervals CI:0.0–3.6%) when there is 1 mm increase in the rainfall lagged by 12 to 14 months ii) by 5.0% (95% CI: 0.8–9.4%) when there is a 1% increase in humidity from July to September in the same epidemiologic year.\n\n\nConclusion/Significance\nHigher rainfall is expected to result in increased density of chenopods, a halophytic plant that constitutes the exclusive food of Psammomys obesus.\n\n Consequently, following a high density of Psammomys obesus, the pool of Leishmania major transmissible from the rodents to blood-feeding female sand flies could lead to a higher probability of transmission to humans over the next season.\n\n These findings provide the evidence that ZCL is highly influenced by climate factors that could affect both Psammomys obesus and the sand fly population densities.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3341328","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

Plasmodium falciparum malaria varies with transmission intensity.\n\n A better understanding of how this varies with the severity of outcome and across a range of transmission settings could enable locally appropriate targeting of interventions to those most at risk.\n\n We have, therefore, undertaken a pooled analysis of existing data from multiple sites to enable a comprehensive overview of the age-patterns of malaria outcomes under different epidemiological conditions in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nA systematic review using PubMed and CAB Abstracts (1980–2005), contacts with experts and searching bibliographies identified epidemiological studies with data on the age distribution of children with P.\n\n falciparum clinical malaria, hospital admissions with malaria and malaria-diagnosed mortality.\n\n Studies were allocated to a 3×2 matrix of intensity and seasonality of malaria transmission.\n\n Maximum likelihood methods were used to fit five continuous probability distributions to the percentage of each outcome by age for each of the six transmission scenarios.\n\n The best-fitting distributions are presented graphically, together with the estimated median age for each outcome.\n\n Clinical malaria incidence was relatively evenly distributed across the first 10 years of life for all transmission scenarios.\n\n Hospital admissions with malaria were more concentrated in younger children, with this effect being even more pronounced for malaria-diagnosed deaths.\n\n For all outcomes, the burden of malaria shifted towards younger ages with increasing transmission intensity, although marked seasonality moderated this effect.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe most severe consequences of P.\n\n falciparum malaria were concentrated in the youngest age groups across all settings.\n\n Despite recently observed declines in malaria transmission in several countries, which will shift the burden of malaria cases towards older children, it is still appropriate to target strategies for preventing malaria mortality and severe morbidity at very young children who will continue to bear the brunt of malaria deaths in Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2813874","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV): A Global Comparative Review","abstract":"Background\nThere is limited information on influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) seasonal patterns in tropical areas, although there is renewed interest in understanding the seasonal drivers of respiratory viruses.\n\n\nMethods\nWe review geographic variations in seasonality of laboratory-confirmed influenza and RSV epidemics in 137 global locations based on literature review and electronic sources.\n\n We assessed peak timing and epidemic duration and explored their association with geography and study settings.\n\n We fitted time series model to weekly national data available from the WHO influenza surveillance system (FluNet) to further characterize seasonal parameters.\n\n\nResults\nInfluenza and RSV activity consistently peaked during winter months in temperate locales, while there was greater diversity in the tropics.\n\n Several temperate locations experienced semi-annual influenza activity with peaks occurring in winter and summer.\n\n Semi-annual activity was relatively common in tropical areas of Southeast Asia for both viruses.\n\n Biennial cycles of RSV activity were identified in Northern Europe.\n\n Both viruses exhibited weak latitudinal gradients in the timing of epidemics by hemisphere, with peak timing occurring later in the calendar year with increasing latitude (P&lt;0.03).\n\n Time series model applied to influenza data from 85 countries confirmed the presence of latitudinal gradients in timing, duration, seasonal amplitude, and between-year variability of epidemics.\n\n Overall, 80% of tropical locations experienced distinct RSV seasons lasting 6 months or less, while the percentage was 50% for influenza.\n\n\nConclusion\nOur review combining literature and electronic data sources suggests that a large fraction of tropical locations experience focused seasons of respiratory virus activity in individual years.\n\n Information on seasonal patterns remains limited in large undersampled regions, included Africa and Central America.\n\n Future studies should attempt to link the observed latitudinal gradients in seasonality of viral epidemics with climatic and population factors, and explore regional differences in disease transmission dynamics and attack rates.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3573019","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

present article reviews the epidemiology, malacology, morbidity, and the milestones the country has made in efforts to control schistosomiasis and discusses future control approaches.\n The available evidence indicates that, both urinary and intestinal schistosomiasis are still highly endemic in Tanzania and cause significant morbidity.\nMass drug administration using praziquantel, currently used as a key intervention measure, has not been successful in decreasing prevalence of infection.\n There is therefore an urgent need to revise the current approach for the successful control of the

Temperature","abstract":"Using the guinea pig as a model host, we show that aerosol spread of influenza virus is dependent upon both ambient relative humidity and temperature.\n Twenty experiments performed at relative humidities from 20% to 80% and 5 °C, 20 °C, or 30 °C indicated that both cold and dry conditions favor transmission.\n The relationship between transmission via aerosols and relative humidity at 20 °C is similar to that previously reported for the stability of influenza viruses (except at high relative humidity, 80%), implying that the effects of humidity act largely at the level of the virus particle.\n For infected guinea pigs housed at 5 °C, the duration of peak shedding was approximately 40 h longer than that of animals housed at 20 °C; this increased shedding likely accounts for the enhanced transmission seen at 5 °C.\n To investigate the mechanism permitting prolonged viral growth, expression levels in the upper respiratory tract of several innate immune mediators were determined.\n Innate responses proved to be comparable between animals housed at 5 °C and 20 °C, suggesting that cold temperature (5 °C) does not impair the innate immune response in this system.\n Although the seasonal epidemiology of influenza is well characterized, the underlying reasons for predominant wintertime spread are not clear.\n We provide direct, experimental evidence to support the role of weather conditions in the dynamics of influenza and thereby address a long-standing question fundamental to the understanding of influenza epidemiology and evolution.\n","id":"PMC2034399","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Anice

Minimal important difference (MID) and Guyatt's responsiveness index were 10.3, 0.71 for the WURSS-21 and 18.5, 0.75 for the WURSS-44. Factorial analysis suggested an eight dimension structure for the WURSS-44 and a three dimension structure for the WURSS-21, with composite reliability coefficients ranging from 0.87 to 0.97, and Cronbach's alpha ranging from 0.76 to 0.96. Both WURSS versions correlated significantly with the Jackson scale (W-21 R = 0.85; W-44 R = 0.88), with the SF-8 physical health (W-21 R = -0.79; W-44 R = -0.80) and SF-8 mental health (W-21 R = -0.55; W-44 R = -0.60).\n\n\nConclusion\nThe WURSS-44 and WURSS-21 perform well as illness-specific quality-of-life evaluative outcome instruments.\n\n Construct validity is supported by the data presented here.\n\n While the WURSS-44 covers more symptoms, the WURSS-21 exhibits similar performance in terms of reliability, responsiveness, importance-to-patients, and convergence with other measures.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2748069","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

selective trends in viral acute respiratory tract infections<","abstract":"Influenza A and B, and many unrelated viruses including rhinovirus, RSV, adenovirus, metapneumovirus and coronavirus share the same seasonality, since these viral acute respiratory tract infections (vARIs) are much more common in winter than summer.\n Unfortunately, early investigations that used recycled “pedigree” virus strains seem to have led microbiologists to dismiss the common folk belief that vARIs often follow chilling.\n Today, incontrovertible evidence shows that ambient temperature dips and host chilling increase the incidence and severity of vARIs.\n This review considers four possible mechanisms, M1 - 4, that can explain this link: (M1) increased crowding in winter may enhance viral transmission; (M2) lower temperatures may increase the stability of virions outside the body; (M3) chilling may increase host susceptibility; (M4) lower temperatures or host chilling may activate dormant virions.\n There is little evidence for M1 or M2, which are incompatible with tropical observations.\n Epidemiological anomalies such as the repeated simultaneous arrival of vARIs over wide geographical areas, the rapid cessation of influenza epidemics, and the low attack rate of influenza within families are compatible with M4, but not M3 (in its simple form).\n M4 seems to be the main driver of seasonality, but M3 may also play an important role.\n","id":"PMC7116927","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Patrick D.","surname":"Shaw

performed at relative humidities from 20% to 80% and 5 °C, 20 °C, or 30 °C indicated that both cold and dry conditions favor transmission.\n The relationship between transmission via aerosols and relative humidity at 20 °C is similar to that previously reported for the stability of influenza viruses (except at high relative humidity, 80%), implying that the effects of humidity act largely at the level of the virus particle.\n For infected guinea pigs housed at 5 °C, the duration of peak shedding was approximately 40 h longer than that of animals housed at 20 °C; this increased shedding likely accounts for the enhanced transmission seen at 5 °C.\n To investigate the mechanism permitting prolonged viral growth, expression levels in the upper respiratory tract of several innate immune mediators were determined.\n Innate responses proved to be comparable between animals housed at 5 °C and 20 °C, suggesting that cold temperature (5 °C) does not impair the innate immune response in this system.\n Although the seasonal epidemiology of influenza is well characterized, the underlying reasons for predominant wintertime spread are not clear.\n We provide direct, experimental evidence to support the role of weather conditions in the dynamics of influenza and thereby address a long-standing question fundamental to the understanding of influenza epidemiology and

understood.\n\n Influenza surveillance in Okinawa is important for clarifying transmission patterns in both temperate and tropical regions.\n\n Using surveillance data, collected over 7 years in the subtropical region of Japan, this study aims to characterize the epidemic patterns of influenza B infection and its association with ambient temperature and relative humidity, in a parallel comparison with influenza A.\n\n\nMethods\nFrom January 2007 until March 2014, two individual influenza surveillance datasets were collected from external sources.\n\n The first dataset, included weekly rapid antigen test (RAT) results from four representative general hospitals, located in the capital city of Okinawa.\n\n A nation-wide surveillance of influenza, diagnosed by RAT results and/or influenza-like illness symptoms, included the age distribution of affected patients and was used as the second dataset.\n\n To analyze the association between infection and local climate conditions, ambient temperature and relative humidity during the study period were retrieved from the Japanese Meteorological Agency website.\n\n\nResults\nAlthough influenza A maintained high number of infections from December through March, epidemics of influenza B infection were observed annually from March through July.\n\n The only observed exception was 2010, when the pandemic strain of 2009 dominated.\n\n During influenza B outbreaks, influenza patients aged 5 to 9 years old and 10 to 14 years old more frequently visited sentinel sites.\n\n Although both ambient temperature and relative humidity are inversely associated with influenza A infection, influenza B infection was found to be directly associated with high relative humidity.\n\n\nConclusion\nFurther studies are needed to elucidate the complex epidemiology of influenza B and its relationship with influenza A.\n\n In the subtropical setting of Okinawa, epidemics of influenza B infection occur from March to July following the influenza A epidemic, and primarily affect school-age children.\n\n These findings help to define unknown aspects of influenza B and can inform healthcare decisions for patients located outside temperate regions.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12879-016-1978-0) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized

Interestingly, a previously unrecognized sub-lineage of A2 was identified in 18.6% (16/86) of the population.\n Using a custom script for network construction based on the TN93 pairwise genetic distance, we identified up to nine HMPV transmission clusters circulating as multiple sub-epidemics.\n Although no apparent major outbreak was observed, the increased frequency of transmission clusters (dyads) during seasonal peaks suggests the potential roles of transmission clusters in driving the spread of HMPV.\n Our findings provide essential information for therapeutic research, prevention strategies, and disease outbreak monitoring of HMPV.\n","id":"PMC4899729","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing Group","authors":[{"firstname":"Wei Zhen","surname":"Chow","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yoke Fun","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiang Yong","surname":"Oong","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Liang Jie","surname":"Ng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Siti Sarah","surname":"Nor’E","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kim Tien","surname":"Ng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kok Gan","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nik Sherina","surname":"Hanafi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yong Kek","surname":"Pang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Adeeba","surname":"Kamarulzaman","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kok Keng","surname":"Tee","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1007/s00431-007-0496-x","date":"2007-04-10","title":"Ten years’ experience with year-round active surveillance of up to 19 respiratory pathogens in children","abstract":"Introduction\nSurveillance systems for acute respiratory infections (ARI) in children currently are often limited in terms of the panel of pathogens and the age range investigated or are only syndromic and at times only active in the winter season.\n\n \nMethods\nWithin PID-ARI.\n\nnet, a research network for ARI in children in Germany, an active, year-round surveillance system was formed in three regions from north to south for population-based analysis.\n\n Children from birth to 16 years of age were included and up to 19 noncolonizing airway pathogens were tested for with multiplex RT-PCR.\n\n \nResults\nIn the 10-year period from July 1996 to June 2006, a total of 18,899 samples were tested.\n\n The positive rate increased with the size of the test panel to up to 72.9%.\n\n Picornaviruses (35–39%), paramyxoviruses (23–28%) and orthomyxoviruses (5.8–12.5%) comprised the highest fraction.\n\n Reoviruses and Legionella pneumophila were not found at all and Chlamydia pneumoniae and Bordetella parapertussis only rarely.\n\n Respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza virus (PIV) type 3 were anticyclical in rhythmicity with metapneumovirus and PIV1 and PIV2.

and Implications for Vaccination Timing","abstract":"Background\nInfluenza surveillance is an important tool to identify emerging/reemerging strains, and defining seasonality.\n\n We describe the distinct patterns of circulating strains of the virus in different areas in India from 2009 to 2013.\nMethods\nPatients in ten cities presenting with influenza like illness in out-patient departments of dispensaries/hospitals and hospitalized patients with severe acute respiratory infections were enrolled.\n\n Nasopharangeal swabs were tested for influenza viruses by real-time RT-PCR, and subtyping; antigenic and genetic analysis were carried out using standard assays.\n\n\nResults\nOf the 44,127 ILI/SARI cases, 6,193 (14.0%) were positive for influenza virus.\n\n Peaks of influenza were observed during July-September coinciding with monsoon in cities Delhi and Lucknow (north), Pune (west), Allaphuza (southwest), Nagpur (central), Kolkata (east) and Dibrugarh (northeast), whereas Chennai and Vellore (southeast) revealed peaks in October-November, coinciding with the monsoon months in these cities.\n\n In Srinagar (Northern most city at 34°N latitude) influenza circulation peaked in January-March in winter months.\n\n The patterns of circulating strains varied over the years: whereas A/H1N1pdm09 and type B co-circulated in 2009 and 2010, H3N2 was the predominant circulating strain in 2011, followed by circulation of A/H1N1pdm09 and influenza B in 2012 and return of A/H3N2 in 2013. Antigenic analysis revealed that most circulating viruses were close to vaccine selected viral strains.\n\n\nConclusions\nOur data shows that India, though physically located in northern hemisphere, has distinct seasonality that might be related to latitude and environmental factors.\n\n While cities with temperate seasonality will benefit from vaccination in September-October, cities with peaks in the monsoon season in July-September will benefit from vaccination in April-May.\n\n Continued surveillance is critical to understand regional differences in influenza seasonality at regional and sub-regional level, especially in countries with large latitude span.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4418715","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

Vaccinate?","abstract":"Background\nThe timing of the biannual WHO influenza vaccine composition selection and production cycle has been historically directed to the influenza seasonality patterns in the temperate regions of the northern and southern hemispheres.\n\n Influenza activity, however, is poorly understood in the tropics with multiple peaks and identifiable year-round activity.\n\n The evidence-base needed to take informed decisions on vaccination timing and vaccine formulation is often lacking for the tropics and subtropics.\n\n This paper aims to assess influenza seasonality in the tropics and subtropics.\n\n It explores geographical grouping of countries into vaccination zones based on optimal timing of influenza vaccination.\n\n\nMethods\nInfluenza seasonality was assessed by different analytic approaches (weekly proportion of positive cases, time series analysis, etc.\n\n) using FluNet and national surveillance data.\n\n In case of discordance in the seasonality assessment, consensus was built through discussions with in-country experts.\n\n Countries with similar onset periods of their primary influenza season were grouped into geographical zones.\n\n\nResults\nThe number and period of peak activity was ascertained for 70 of the 138 countries in the tropics and subtropics.\n\n Thirty-seven countries had one and seventeen countries had two distinct peaks.\n\n Countries near the equator had secondary peaks or even identifiable year-round activity.\n\n The main influenza season in most of South America and Asia started between April and June.\n\n The start of the main season varied widely in Africa (October and December in northern Africa, April and June in Southern Africa and a mixed pattern in tropical Africa).\n\n Eight “influenza vaccination zones” (two each in America and Asia, and four in Africa and Middle East) were defined with recommendations for vaccination timing and vaccine formulation.\n\n The main limitation of our study is that FluNet and national surveillance data may lack the granularity to detect sub-national variability in seasonality patterns.\n\n\nConclusion\nDistinct influenza seasonality patterns, though complex, could be ascertained for most countries in the tropics and subtropics using national surveillance data.\n\n It may be possible to group countries into zones based on similar recommendations for vaccine timing and formulation.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4847850","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7121484","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical Society","authors":[{"firstname":"Qun","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuhua","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoye","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yeqing","surname":"Tong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ruiqi","surname":"Ren","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kathy S.M.","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Eric H.Y.","surname":"Lau","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jessica Y.","surname":"Wong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuesen","surname":"Xing","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nijuan","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chao","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tian","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Man","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wenxiao","surname":"Tu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chuding","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lianmei","surname":"Jin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rui","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Suhua","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rui","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yinbo","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ge","surname":"Shao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhongfa","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhiqiang","surname":"Deng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Boxi","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhitao","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yanping","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guoqing","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tommy T.Y.","surname":"Lam","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Joseph T.","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"George F.","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Benjamin J.","surname":"Cowling","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gabriel M.","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zijian","surname":"Feng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":".

hypotheses.\n Traditional methods based on deterministic assumptions, such as ordinary differential equations (ODE), have been successful in those scenarios.\n However, noise caused by random variations rather than true differences is an intrinsic feature of the cellular/molecular/social world.\n Time series data from patients (in the case of clinical science) or number of infections (in the case of epidemics) can vary due to both intrinsic differences or incidental fluctuations.\n The use of traditional fitting methods for ODEs applied to noisy problems implies that deviation from some trend can only be due to error or parametric heterogeneity, that is noise can be wrongly classified as parametric heterogeneity.\n This leads to unstable predictions and potentially misguided policies or research programs.\n In this paper, we quantify the ability of ODEs under different hypotheses (fixed or random effects) to capture individual differences in the underlying data.\n We explore a simple (exactly solvable) example displaying an initial exponential growth by comparing state-of-the-art stochastic fitting and traditional least squares approximations.\n We also provide a

caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).\n\n Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (?18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.\n\n\nFindings\n191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital.\n\n 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients).\n\n Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·03–1·17, per year increase; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·61–12·23; p&lt;0·0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL (18·42, 2·64–128·55; p=0·0033) on admission.\n\n Median duration of viral shedding was 20·0 days (IQR 17·0–24·0) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors.\n\n The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage.\n\n Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.\n\n\nFunding\nChinese Academy of Medical Sciences Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences;

Importantly, strains with high genetic similarity to SARS-CoV in the hypervariable N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 gene, the ORF3 and ORF8 region, respectively, were all discovered in this cave.\n In addition, we report the first discovery of bat SARSr-CoVs highly similar to human SARS-CoV in ORF3b and in the split ORF8a and 8b.\n Moreover, SARSr-CoV strains from this cave were more closely related to SARS-CoV in the non-structural protein genes ORF1a and 1b compared with those detected elsewhere.\n Recombination analysis shows evidence of frequent

results revealed 81% shared nucleotide identity with human/civet SARS CoVs, which was more distant than that observed previously for bat SL-CoVs in China.\n Importantly, using pathogenic tests, we found that the virus can reproduce and cause disease in suckling rats, and further studies showed that the virus-like particles can be observed in the brains of suckling rats by electron microscopy.\n Thus, this study increased our understanding of the genetic diversity of the SL-CoVs carried by bats and also provided a new perspective to study the possibility of cross-species transmission of SL-CoVs using suckling rats as an animal model.\n","id":"PMC6135831","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing Group

coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and Prevention of Infectious Disease in China, Chinese Academy of

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome

migration departure decision in a bat","abstract":"Migratory decisions in birds are closely tied to environmental cues and fat stores, but it remains unknown if the same variables trigger bat migration.\n To learn more about the rare phenomenon of bat migration, we studied departure decisions of female common noctules (Nyctalus noctula) in southern Germany.\n We did not find the fattening period that modulates departure decisions in birds.\n Female noctules departed after a regular evening foraging session, uniformly heading northeast.\n As the day of year increased, migratory decisions were based on the interactions among wind speed, wind direction and air pressure.\n As the migration season progressed, bats were likely to migrate on nights with higher air pressure and faster tail winds in the direction of travel, and also show high probability of migration on low-pressure nights with slow head winds.\n Common noctules thus monitor complex environmental conditions to find the optimal migration night.\n","id":"PMC5627173","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"The Royal Society","authors":[{"firstname":"Dina K.

phototaxis","abstract":"Artificial light at night is spreading worldwide at unprecedented rates, exposing strictly nocturnal animals such as bats to a novel anthropogenic stressor.\n Previous studies about the effect of artificial light on bats focused almost exclusively on non-migratory species, yet migratory animals such as birds are known to be largely affected by light pollution.\n Thus, we conducted a field experiment to evaluate if bat migration is affected by artificial light at night.\n In late summer, we presented artificial green light of 520 nm wavelength to bats that were migrating south along the shoreline of the Baltic Sea.\n Using a light on-off treatment, we observed that the activity of Pipistrellus nathusii and P.\n pygmaeus, the two most abundant migratory species at our site, increased by more than 50% in the light-on compared to the light-off treatment.\n We observed an increased number of feeding buzzes during the light-on compared to the light-off treatment for P.\n nathusii.\n However, feeding activity was low in general and did not increase disproportionately during the light-on treatment in relation to the overall echolocation call activity of bats.\n Further, P.\n nathusii were attracted towards the green light at a distance of about 23 m, which is way beyond the echolocation detection range for insects of Nathusius’ bats.\n We therefore infer that migratory bats were not attracted to artificial green light because of high insect densities, but instead by positive phototaxis.\n We conclude that artificial light at night may potentially impact bat migration in a yet unrecognized way.\n","id":"PMC5451015","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Christian

by red light but not by warm?white light: Implications for the protection of nocturnal migrants","abstract":"The replacement of conventional lighting with energy?saving light emitting diodes (LED) is a worldwide trend, yet its consequences for animals and ecosystems are poorly understood.\n Strictly nocturnal animals such as bats are particularly sensitive to artificial light at night (ALAN).\n Past studies have shown that bats, in general, respond to ALAN according to the emitted light color and that migratory bats, in particular, exhibit phototaxis in response to green light.\n As red and white light is frequently used in outdoor lighting, we asked how migratory bats respond to these wavelength spectra.\n At a major migration corridor, we recorded the presence of migrating bats based on ultrasonic recorders during 10?min light?on/light?off intervals to red or warm?white LED, interspersed with dark controls.\n When the red LED was switched on, we observed an increase in flight activity for Pipistrellus pygmaeus and a trend for a higher activity for Pipistrellus nathusii.\n As the higher flight activity of bats was not associated with increased feeding, we rule out the possibility that bats foraged at the red LED light.\n Instead, bats may have flown toward the red LED light source.\n When exposed to warm?white LED, general flight activity at the light source did not increase, yet we observed an increased foraging activity directly at the light source compared to the dark control.\n Our findings highlight a response of migratory bats toward LED light that was dependent on light color.\n The most parsimonious explanation for the response to red LED is phototaxis and for the response to warm?white LED foraging.\n Our findings call for caution in the application of red aviation lighting, particularly at wind turbines, as this light color might attract bats, leading eventually to an increased collision risk of migratory bats at wind turbines.\n","id":"PMC6194273","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley and Sons Inc.","authors":[{"firstname":"Christian

changing data, a range of case fatality ratio estimates for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been produced that differ substantially in magnitude.\n\n We aimed to provide robust estimates, accounting for censoring and ascertainment biases.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected individual-case data for patients who died from COVID-19 in Hubei, mainland China (reported by national and provincial health commissions to Feb 8, 2020), and for cases outside of mainland China (from government or ministry of health websites and media reports for 37 countries, as well as Hong Kong and Macau, until Feb 25, 2020).\n\n These individual-case data were used to estimate the time between onset of symptoms and outcome (death or discharge from hospital).\n\n We next obtained age-stratified estimates of the case fatality ratio by relating the aggregate distribution of cases to the observed cumulative deaths in China, assuming a constant attack rate by age and adjusting for demography and age-based and location-based under-ascertainment.\n\n We also estimated the case fatality ratio from individual line-list data on 1334 cases identified outside of mainland China.\n\n Using data on the prevalence of PCR-confirmed cases in international residents repatriated from China, we obtained age-stratified estimates of the infection fatality ratio.\n\n Furthermore, data on age-stratified severity in a subset of 3665 cases from China were used to estimate the proportion of infected individuals who are likely to require hospitalisation.\n\n\nFindings\nUsing data on 24 deaths that occurred in mainland China and 165 recoveries outside of China, we estimated the mean duration from onset of symptoms to death to be 17·8 days (95% credible interval [CrI] 16·9–19·2) and to hospital discharge to be 24·7 days (22·9–28·1).\n\n In all laboratory confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases from mainland China (n=70?117), we estimated a crude case fatality ratio (adjusted for censoring) of 3·67% (95% CrI 3·56–3·80).\n\n However, after further adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment, we obtained a best estimate of the case fatality ratio in China of 1·38% (1·23–1·53), with substantially higher ratios in older age groups (0·32% [0·27–0·38] in those aged &lt;60 years vs 6·4% [5·7–7·2] in those aged ?60 years), up to 13·4% (11·2–15·9) in those aged 80 years or older.\n\n Estimates of case fatality ratio from international cases stratified by age were consistent with those from China (parametric estimate 1·4% [0·4–3·5] in those aged &lt;60 years [n=360] and 4·5% [1·8–11·1] in those aged ?60 years [n=151]).\n\n Our estimated overall infection fatality ratio for China was 0·66% (0·39–1·33), with an increasing profile with age.\n\n Similarly, estimates of the proportion of infected individuals likely to be hospitalised increased with age up to a maximum of 18·4% (11·0–37·6) in those aged 80 years or older.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThese early estimates give an indication of the fatality ratio across the spectrum of COVID-19 disease and show a strong age gradient in risk of death.\n\n\nFunding\nUK Medical Research

Facemask wearing with proper hand hygiene is considered an effective measure to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission, but facemask wearing has become a social concern due to the global facemask shortage.\n\n China is the major facemask producer in the world, contributing to 50% of global production.\n\n However, a universal facemask wearing policy would put an enormous burden on the facemask supply.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed a policy review concerning facemasks using government websites and mathematical modelling shortage analyses based on data obtained from the National Health Commission (NHC), the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and General Administration of Customs (GAC) of the People's Republic of China.\n\n Three scenarios with respect to wearing facemasks were considered: (1) a universal facemask wearing policy implementation in all regions of mainland China; (2) a universal facemask wearing policy implementation only in the epicentre (Hubei province, China); and (3) no implementation of a universal facemask wearing policy.\n\n\nFindings\nRegardless of different universal facemask wearing policy scenarios, facemask shortage would occur but eventually end during our prediction period (from 20 Jan 2020 to 30 Jun 2020).\n\n The duration of the facemask shortage described in the scenarios of a country-wide universal facemask wearing policy, a universal facemask wearing policy in the epicentre, and no universal facemask wearing policy were 132, seven, and four days, respectively.\n\n During the prediction period, the largest daily facemask shortages were predicted to be 589·5, 49·3, and 37·5 million in each of the three scenarios, respectively.\n\n In any scenario, an N95 mask shortage was predicted to occur on 24 January 2020 with a daily facemask shortage of 2·2 million.\n\n\nInterpretation\nImplementing a universal facemask wearing policy in the whole of China could lead to severe facemask shortage.\n\n Without effective public communication, a universal facemask wearing policy could result in societal panic and subsequently, increase the nationwide and worldwide demand for facemasks.\n\n These increased demands could cause a facemask shortage for healthcare workers and reduce the effectiveness of outbreak control in the affected regions, eventually leading to a pandemic.\n\n To fight novel infectious disease outbreaks, such as COVID-19, governments should monitor domestic facemask supplies and give priority to healthcare workers.\n\n The risk of asymptomatic transmission and facemask shortages should be carefully evaluated before introducing a universal facemask wearing policy in high-risk regions.\n\n Public health measures aimed at improving hand hygiene and effective public communication should be considered along with the facemask policy.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7129293","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier","authors":[{"firstname":"Huai-liang","surname":"Wu","email":"wuhuailiang@stu2014.jnu.edu.cn","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jian","surname":"Huang","email":"jian.huang@imperial.ac.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Casper

Nine livebirths were recorded.\n\n No neonatal asphyxia was observed in newborn babies.\n\n All nine livebirths had a 1-min Apgar score of 8–9 and a 5-min Apgar score of 9–10. Amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk samples from six patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and all samples tested negative for the virus.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe clinical characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women were similar to those reported for non-pregnant adult patients who developed COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n Findings from this small group of cases suggest that there is currently no evidence for intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission in women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy.\n\n\nFunding\nHubei Science and

the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41

More policing about precautionary measures and ensuring diagnostic testing and accuracy are needed.\nIntroduction\nCOVID-19 is a novel corona virus which is currently treated as severe pneumonia and reportedly has a very high human-to-human transmission risk. COVID-19 was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) in January 2020 and in March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic and since it has affected 213 countries and two international conveyances. In Pakistan, the Ministry of Health and government of Pakistan confirmed the first case of COVID-19 on February 26, 2020 in Karachi, the capital of the province of Sindh. The early cases of COVID-19 were reported in pilgrims returning from Iran, Iraq, and Syria who were crossing the bordering city Taftan, Balochistan, and reportedly then travelling to other cities, mainly to Karachi and Gilgit-Baltistan. Within a few weeks time, the numbers of COVID-19 cases soared rapidly; affecting every province and territory in Pakistan. Although initially COVID-19 was mainly reported in travellers, with time there was an increase in community transmission. To deal with the pandemic, and following the international protocol, the federal government-imposed lockdowns, travel restrictions, and a ban on mass public gatherings to control the spread of COVID-19.\nIn Pakistan, a common public believe is that the transmission of COVID-19 will decrease with the rise in temperature during the summer season. Human-to-human contact is key in the transmission of viral illnesses such as influenza, however environmental factors such as humidity, temperature, wind, and sun exposure play an important role in disease transmission. In other corona viruses such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), climatic factors are known to affect viral transmission. Climatic factors such as temperature and humidity affects factors such as viral viability and persistence, as well as people's behavior and decisions:such as meeting for social gatherings. As compared to the better-known corona viruses, COVID-19 is a novel infection and an exact comparison to transmission and mortality is not available. Comparisons are difficult, potentially due to the differences in transmission such as the rapid spread that created limitations in hospital resources that stretched hospitals beyond their capabilities. Although many symptoms of COVID-19 are the same as the seasonal flu, COVID-19 is different than the common flu in terms of the incubation period, transmission, effects on age groups, and risk factors associated with COVID-19.\nWith the continuous increase in the number of COVID-19 cases and speculations about the second wave throughout the world, there is need for a high level of action, proper, and thoughtful planning, and management. It will be important to explore the transmissibility of COVID-19 and any association with climatic factors that affect daily incidence, mortality, and recovery rate. As Pakistan does not have uniform weather throughout all provinces and territories, having an understanding about the transmission of COVID-19 during natural environment and climatic changes will be helpful to support decision-making related to disease control. The goal of this article was to explore whether climatic factors such as humidity, wind, temperature, and sun exposure influence the transmission of COVID-19.\nMethods\nTo conduct this analysis, data was collected from various websites and online sources as reported in previous studies, thus ethical approval was not needed. No web scrapping software or programs were used, and data was not altered in any regards. Data was compared to multiple other sources to confirm authenticity.\nPopulation data: COVID-19 cases, deaths, recovery and daily testing for each province and, Islamabad, as well as Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Kashmir were collected online from March 10 to July 10th, 2020.\nWeather data: Weather data consisted of daily mean humidity and wind, daily maximum and minimum temperature and sun status. Reports of &quot;broken clouds&quot; and &quot;partly sunny&quot; were merged with &quot;cloudy days&quot;, and &quot;scattered clouds&quot; were merged with &quot;sunny days&quot;.\nStatistical analysis: Descriptively we reported the cumulative incidence data, deaths, and daily recovery for each province and territory. Continuous variable such as wind (KM/H), humidity (%) and temperature ( C) were reported with mean and standard deviation (SD); whereas categorical data such as daily tests, sunny days, lock down status were reported with numbers and proportions.\nData was analyzed with a log link of negative binomial distribution using the generalized linear mixed model. We chose to use a negative binominal regression model as it is more suitable for count data. The model of fit was determined with the likelihood ratio and the outcome for each territory was reported separately. Besides weather data, the analysis was also adjusted for other variables such as lock down status (lock down vs. smart lock down vs. no lock down) and maximum daily testing status (&gt;=10,000 vs. &lt;10,000). In March-May of 2020 there were few nationwide events that required mass gatherings during which standard operating procedures (SOP) were potentially compromised. The nationwide events included religious events that required mass gatherings, Ramadan (iftar parties), and Eid days. As the incubation period for COVID-19 is 3 to 14 days, we included the following 14 days as a continuation for each nationwide event. First, we analyzed the association of climatic factors, lock down status, maximum daily testing with outcomes variable in univarable analysis. All variables were included in the final analysis for COVID-19 incidence, but the analyses for daily deaths and recovery were not adjusted for lock down status, number of daily testing, and nationwide social events. As humidity correlates with temperature, the interaction between humidity and temperature was included in our secondary analysis. The effect estimates were reported with odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS v.25. statistical software.\nResults\nA summary of cumulative COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries are reported in Table 1. As of July 10th, 2020, there were 246,351 confirmed cases of COVID-19:5,123 (2.07%) patients died and 153,134 (62.16%) recovered. Sindh was the most affected province in the country, with a confirmed 102,368 (41.55%) cases, whereas Azad Kashmir region (AZK) had the lowest cumulative cases of COVID-19 (0.62%). Daily mortality rate was highest in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) (3.60%) followed by AZK (2.74%). Most recoveries occurred in Gilgit Baltistan (79.93%) followed by Islamabad (74.00%). Figure 1 shows cumulative COVID-19 cases, death, and recoveries. Figure 2 shows the reported daily cases and tests conducted in Pakistan as well as the number of daily COVID-19 cases corresponding with the number of daily tests and trends in daily cases over 123 days. The peaks in daily cases corresponded with the 3-14 day incubation period and were associated with nationwide events and the loosening of lock down restrictions.\nCumulative cases, deaths, and recoveries due to COVID-19.\nDaily COVID-19 cases and tests. Day 23 = Lock down started in Pakistan; Day 24 = Nationwide event; Day 56 = 10000 tests/day target achieved; Day 61 = Loosening of lock down; Ramadan + Eid = Day 45-76; Day 76 = Eid Day; Day 98 = Beginning of selective lock down.\nCumulative incidence, deaths, recovery and mean wind, humidity, temperature minimum (min) and maximum (max).\nREGION	Cumulative incidence	Cumulative Deaths	Cumulative Recovery	Total tests	Mean Wind (KM/H)	Mean Humidity (%)	Mean Temperature-Max (C) mean (SD)	Mean temperature-Min (C) mean (SD)	Sunny Day	 	Sindh	102,368(41.55%)	1,713 (33.43%)(1.67%) *	59,185 (38.64%)(57.81%) *	254,559 (33.36%)	16.39 (5.37)	61.91 (11.63)	35.23 (3.60)	26.32 (4.25)	98 (79.7%)	 	Punjab	85,991(34.90%)	1,985 (38.74%)(2.30%) *	53,836 (35.15%)(62.60%) *	302,720 (39.67%)	11.95 (7.35)	53.41 (15.67)	34.13 (6.19)	22.06 (5.7)	103 (83.7%)	 	KPK	29,775(12.08%)	1,074 (20.96%)(3.60%) *	20,271 (13.23%)(68.08%) *	84,842 (11.11%)	14.19 (6.83)	52.24 (15.62)	31.86 (6.59)	20.63 (5.73)	83 (67.5%9)	 	Balochistan	11,128(4.51%)	126 (2.45%)(1.132%) *	7,224 (4.71%)(64.91%) *	33,283 (4.36%)	18.24 (11.99)	32.08 (18.07)	28.37 (7.50)	16.86 (7.33)	102 (82.9%)	 	Islamabad	13,927(5.65%)	147 (2.86%)(1.05%) *	10,441 (6.81)(74.96%) *	65,634 (8.601%)	12.53 (8.09)	50.83 (20.38)	31.43 (6.20)	20.21 (5.49)	63 (51.2%)	 	Gilgit Baltistan	1,630(0.66%)	36 (0.7%)(2.20%) *	1,303 (0.85%)(79.93%) *	12,579 (1.64%)	2.60 (2.49)	58.19 (19.64)	25.60 (6.79)	13.50 (5.95)	60 (48.8%)	 	Azad Kashmir	1,532(0.62%)	42 (0.81%)(2.74%) *	94 (0.58%)(58.35%) *	9,437 (1.23%)	4.39 (5.88)	57.35 (18.51)	28.11 (6.21)	16.14 (5.09)	60 (48.8%)	 	Total	246,3511109 cases/million	5,123 (2.07%)23 deaths/million	153,134 (62.16%)689 recoveries/million	763,054		 	\nNote: KPK: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa; * = proportions from the total cases of each region\nCOVID-19 daily cases:univariable analysis [OR (95%CI)].\n	SINDH	PUNJAB	KPK	BALOCHISTAN	ISBD	GILGIT	AZK	 	Wind	1.11(1.06, 1.15)	1.04(1.00, 1.07)	1.04(1.01, 1.07)	1.01(0.99, 1.03)	1.01(0.99, 1.04)	1.01(0.93, 1.10)	0.99(0.95, 1.02)	 	Humidity	1.03(1.01, 1.04)	0.98(0.97, 0.99)	0.96(0.95, 0.97)	0.98(0.97, 0.99)	0.98(0.97, 0.99)	0.99(0.98, 1.00)	0.97(0.96, 0.98)	 	Temperature Daily Max	1.59(1.45, 1.74)	1.20(1.15, 1.24)	1.18(1.14, 1.21)	1.12(1.09, 1.15)	1.22(1.18, 1.26)	1.05(1.02, 1.08)	1.19(1.14, 1.23)	 	Temperature Daily min	1.30(1.26, 1.34)	1.15(1.12, 1.18)	1.23(1.19, 1.28)	1.11(1.08, 1.15)	1.28(1.24, 1.33)	1.04(1.01, 1.07)	1.18(1.14, 1.23)	 	Sunny Day (Sunny day; Ref = No)	0.76(0.49, 1.18)	1.15(0.71, 1.85)	0.54(0.37, 0.79)	1.18(0.74, 1.90)	0.41(0.29, 0.59)	0.68(0.47, 0.99)	0.40(0.28, 0.588)	 	Lock down stat (Ref = Lock down period)	3.2(2.12, 4.81)	2.92(1.94, 4.40)	2.20(1.46, 3.31)	2.42(1.60, 3.65)	9.29, (6.13, 14.10)	2.42(1.57, 3.73)	5.06(3.15, 8.14)	 	Smart lock down stat (Ref = Lock down period)	7.87(4.77, 12.97)	4.76(2.89, 7.85)	4.22(2.55, 6.95)	2.51(1.51, 4.14)	14.11(8.50, 23.41)	3.09(1.83, 5.20)	17.71(10.19, 30.80)	 	Nationwide Events*	0.74(0.52, 1.06)	1.12(0.78, 1.61)	1.00(0.70, 1.44)	1.72(1.20, 2.47)	1.53(1.06, 2.19)	1.08(0.74, 1.57)	0.80(0.55, 1.16)	 	10000/Daily Test	10.28(7.20, 14.68)	8.43(5.9, 12.04)	6.88(4.81, 9.84)	6.58(4.59, 9.44)	26.46(18.30, 38.25)	2.81(1.93, 4.08)	16.64(10.85, 25.53)	 	COVID-19 Daily Cases:Multivariable Analysis [OR (95%CI)]	 		SINDH	PUNJAB	KPK	BALOCHISTAN	ISBD	GILGIT	AZK	 	Wind	1.010(0.969, 1.053)	1.009(0.980, 1.039)	0.998(0.968, 1.028)	1.020(0.999, 1.041)	0.997(0.973, 1.022)	0.985(0.904, 1.073)	0.974(0.939, 1.010)	 	Humidity	0.996(0.977, 1.015)	1.001(0.983, 1.019)	1.010(0.992, 1.028)	1.004(0.989, 1.019)	1.015(1.004, 1.026)	1.001(0.991, 1.011)	0.999(0.984, 1.014)	 	Temperature Daily Max	1.075(0.965, 1.197)	1.044(0.986, 1.106)	1.009(0.916, 1.106)	1.017(0.949, 1.090)	1.068(1.004, 1.136)	1.027(0.969, 1.089)	1.011(0.941, 1.085)	 	Temperature Daily min	1.130(1.040, 1.228)	1.043(0.989, 1.101)	1.150(1.040, 1.271)	1.055(0.996, 1.117)	1.105(1.032, 1.182)	0.984(0.925, 1.046)	1.012(0.942, 1.087)	 	Sunny Day (Sunny day; Ref = No)	0.959(0.587, 1.567)	1.209(0.720, 2.029)	0.9790.606, 1.58	0.780(0.470, 1.296)	1.047(0.680, 1.612)	1.154(0.701, 1.900)	0.976(0.594, 1.604)	 	Lock down stat (Ref = Lock down period)	1.025(0.426, 2.465)	0.611(0.263, 1.421)	0.4010.169, 0.951	0.344(0.198, 0.598)	0.674(0.352, 1.293)	1.550(0.882, 2.725)	0.636(0.273, 1.485)	 	Smart lock down stat (Ref = Lock down period)	2.868(0.624, 13.175)	1.222 (0.240, 6.217)	0.5520.111, 2.751	0.180(0.073, 0.446)	0.754(0.292, 1.949)	1.608(0.671, 3.851)	3.243(1.069, 9.843)	 	Nationwide Events*	1.963(0.844, 4.565)	2.262(0.991, 5.161)	1.7100.759, 3.855	1.010(0.589, 1.733)	1.761(1.008, 3.079)	1.025(0.624, 1.684)	2.803(1.581, 4.969)	 	10000/Daily Test	3.273(1.115, 9.609)	5.548(1.955, 15.74)	4.9305(1.622, 14.833)	9.963(4.049, 24.514)	9.496(3.644, 24.748)	2.173(1.031, 4.580)	9.470(3.473, 25.819)	 	\nNote: * Includes both religious or nation-wide social event that required mass gatherings or when the SOP were potentially not strictly followed.

In univariable analysis, humidity was associated with a lower incidence of COVID-19; whereas temperature, lock down status, and number of daily tests were associated with higher daily incidence rate. Humidity was also associated with a decrease in death and recovery rates, whereas temperature was associated with higher death and recovery rates.\nResults of adjusted analysis: Results of the adjusted analysis for daily new cases, deaths, and recoveries are reported in Table 2, 3 and 4, respectively. In multivariable analysis, except &gt;10,000 tests per day, no other variable was consistently associated with an increase in the number of daily cases (Table 2). With more than 10,000 tests per day, the effect estimates (OR) ranged from 2.173 to 9.963. In multivariable analysis, none of the climatic factors were associated with daily COVID-19 incidence. Daily temperature showed a non-significant trend towards higher daily incidence which became more obvious with reports of daily low temperatures, although low temperatures showed a trend towards higher COVID-19 incidence. Similarly, nationwide events showed non-significant but consistent trends towards increased incidence of infection. Lock down status was not associated with daily incidence rate but mostly showed trend towards high daily incidence rate.\nIn multivariable analysis, no variable was consistently associated with daily death rates or daily recoveries through all regions (Table 3 and 4). Daily low temperatures showed a trend towards higher recovery rate. The analysis of interaction between temperature and humidity was not significant for all three outcomes.\nDiscussion\nOur goal was to explore the association of four important environmental factors; wind, humidity, temperature, and daily sun exposure with respect to the transmission of COVID-19. We adjusted our analysis for other important variables such as lock down status, nation wide social events, and daily testing for the COVID-19. The multivariable analysis showed trends for higher odds and increased COVID-19 incidence with low daily temperature. However, high temperature was not significantly associated with the daily COVID-19 incidence. The multivariable analysis showed that the number of daily tests performed was the only factor significantly associated with increased daily incidence of COVID-19. Contrary to common belief, climatic factors:particularly temperature and humidity, did not have consistent association with daily COVID-19 cases. Nationwide social events and lock down status mostly showed a non-significant trend towards increased COVID-19 daily incidences. In the multivariable analysis, no factor showed a consistent association with daily deaths or recoveries throughout all regions. For daily recoveries, daily low temperatures showed a trend towards higher recovery rate.\nConclusion\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the association between environmental factors, daily tests, nation wide events and lock down status with daily COVID-19 incidence, recoveries, and death dues to COVID-19 in Pakistan. Our study did not show an association between the environmental factors and daily COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries and thus the speculations that the COVID-19 will decrease with warm temperature was not supported. A recent report suggested that weather may alter COVID-19 transmission but may not completely eliminate it. Due to social beliefs among the Pakistani nation, national and local governments need to take rigorous measures to educate people about the importance of social distancing as it remains our strongest method of prevention. Stronger strategies and resources at the national and local levels of government are needed to increase daily testing for COVID-19.More research is needed to explore the true effect of environmental factors such as wind, temperature, humidity, and sun exposure while adjusting for other important factors such as age, gender, socioeconomic factors, underlying comorbidities with daily risks of COVID-19 spread, mortality and recovery, and therefore having more testing, and thus more data, is critical to understanding the true effects and patterns of the virus.\nStrengths and limitations\nThe key strengths of this study were firstly, the analysis was adjusted for other key variables such as lock down status, number of daily testing, and nationwide mass social gatherings. Secondly, we explored the effect of various climatic factors on different outcomes, which makes the interpretation broad. Thirdly, data was collected on daily basis rather than on a weekly or monthly basis. Limitations of our study are due to the nature of the data utilized, we could not adjust for socioeconomic status, gender, air pollutants and comorbidities. As well, data was collected mainly from publicly available websites compared to data used in a population-based study design, however the data was collected through authentic websites and was compared with multiple sources for accuracy.\nRelevance to literature and current trends of COVID-19\nIn Pakistan, temperatures did not show significant association with the COVID-19 daily incidence. However, a trend for increased incidence of COVID-19 was noted with lower temperatures. Similarly, inconsistent association of temperature with the COVID-19 incidence was also reported in Hubei, China, where temperature showed a significant reduction in COVID-19 cases, but similar associations with temperature were not reported in other parts of China.39 Our results differed from previous studies that showed significant association of environmental factors such as temperature, wind, humidity with incidences of COVID-19 deaths and recoveries. One potential explanation for the variation between our results and the previous studies could be due to differences in the analysis plan. Previous studies analyzed the association between environmental factors and COVID-19 incidence with correlation analysis. We measured association between environmental factors and COVID-19 incidence, death rates and recoveries using regression. Regression is a more suitable analysis method than correlation when predictive association of a variable is desired with the outcome and allows adjusting for other variables that can potentially affect the outcome. Zhu analyzed data using generalized additive method (GAM) and piecewise linear regression to determine the association between COVID-19 incidence and environmental factors. Zhu did not report significant association of temperature with COVID-19 incidence, which concur with our results. Our findings also support the current international trend of COVID-19. On June 8th, 2020 New Zealand declared the nation free from COVID-19 and lifted all restrictions. June is winter in New Zealand with an average temperature of 11.5 C, ranging from 15 C during the day to 8 C at night. If the temperature had influenced COVID-19 spread, then it should not have experienced dramatic reductions in reported COVID-19 cases. New Zealand initially imposed very strict lock down measures and surveillance for COVID-19 that were considered effective in reducing the transmission of COVID-19, but as New Zealand loosened the restrictions new cases of COVID-19 began to emerge. Also, in countries such as India and Brazil with more moderate-to-warm climate, high temperatures did not show effects on reported daily COVID-19 cases. In a lab study by Chin et al, the COVID-19 virus became inactive after 30 minutes at 56 C and 5 minutes at 70 C. If temperature has association with COVID-19 transmission, such high environmental temperatures are not likely in day-to-day life. The only finding that consistently showed significant association with daily COVID-19 incidence was increased daily testing. This also aligns with international trends found in countries with higher reported COVID-19 cases like the United States of America, where they have had the resources to perform more testing.\nClinical implications\nIn multivariable analyses, only daily testing was associated with higher odds of daily COVID-19 incidence. In most regions, lock down status showed trend for lower odds of COVID-19 incidence and although non-significant, nationwide mass gatherings did show consistent trends towards high incidence. As compared to New Zealand and China, lock down status in Pakistan was not significantly associated with COVID-19 incidence. One possible explanation for the lack of association with lock down status could be due to the majority of the Pakistani nation's social beliefs, potentially people did not follow lock down restriction and SOP strictly. This pattern shows that social distancing remains a vital prevention strategy. COVID-19 is the third major corona virus outbreak after SARS and MERS, both which showed some variation with weather, but it was precautionary measures such as the policies adopted at the international, national, and public level that proved effective in controlling the major outbreaks of these viruses.\nConflict of interest: All authors declare no conflicts of interest in this

Prior to 2014, MERS-CoV was mostly associated with sporadic cases of human illness, of presumed zoonotic origin, though chains of person-to-person transmission in the healthcare setting were reported.\n In spring 2014, large healthcare-associated outbreaks of MERS-CoV infection occurred in Jeddah and Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\n To date the epidemiological information published by public health investigators in affected jurisdictions has been relatively limited.\n However, it is important that the global public health community have access to information on the basic epidemiological features of the outbreak to date, including the basic reproduction number (R0) and best estimates of case-fatality rates (CFR).\n We sought to address these gaps using a publicly available line listing of MERS-CoV cases.\n\nMethods: R0 was estimated using the incidence decay with exponential adjustment (“IDEA”) method, while period-specific case fatality rates that incorporated non-attributed death data were estimated using Monte Carlo simulation.\n\nResults: 707 cases were available for evaluation.\n 52% of cases were identified as primary, with the rest being secondary.\n IDEA model fits suggested a higher R0 in Jeddah (3.5-6.7) than in Riyadh (2.0-2.8); control parameters suggested more rapid reduction in transmission in the former city than the latter.\n The model accurately projected final size and end date of the Riyadh outbreak based on information available prior to the outbreak peak; for Jeddah, these projections were possible once the outbreak peaked.\n Overall case-fatality was 40%; depending on the timing of 171 deaths unlinked to case data, outbreak CFR could be higher, lower, or equivalent to pre-outbreak CFR.\n\nConclusions: Notwithstanding imperfect data, inferences about MERS-CoV epidemiology important for public health preparedness are possible using publicly available data sources.\n The R0 estimated in Riyadh appears similar to that seen for SARS-CoV, but CFR appears higher, and indirect evidence suggests control activities ended these outbreaks.\n These data suggest this disease should be regarded with equal or greater concern than the related SARS-CoV.\n","id":"PMC4322060","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Maimuna S.","surname":"Majumder","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Caitlin","surname":"Rivers","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Eric","surname":"Lofgren","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"David","surname":"Fisman","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2002032","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China","abstract":"Background\nSince December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found

The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found

Striking subnational disparities emerged in personal health-care access and quality, with China and India having particularly large gaps between locations with the highest and lowest scores in 2016. In China, performance ranged from 91·5 (89·1–93·6) in Beijing to 48·0 (43·4–53·2) in Tibet (a 43·5-point difference), while India saw a 30·8-point disparity, from 64·8 (59·6–68·8) in Goa to 34·0 (30·3–38·1) in Assam.\n\n Japan recorded the smallest range in subnational HAQ performance in 2016 (a 4·8-point difference), whereas differences between subnational locations with the highest and lowest HAQ Index values were more than two times as high for the USA and three times as high for England.\n\n State-level gaps in the HAQ Index in Mexico somewhat narrowed from 1990 to 2016 (from a 20·9-point to 17·0-point difference), whereas in Brazil, disparities slightly increased across states during this time (a 17·2-point to 20·4-point difference).\n\n Performance on the HAQ Index showed strong linkages to overall development, with high and high-middle SDI countries generally having higher scores and faster gains for non-communicable diseases.\n\n Nonetheless, countries across the development spectrum saw substantial gains in some key health service areas from 2000 to 2016, most notably vaccine-preventable diseases.\n\n Overall, national performance on the HAQ Index was positively associated with higher levels of total health spending per capita, as well as health systems inputs, but these relationships were quite heterogeneous, particularly among low-to-middle SDI countries.\n\n\nInterpretation\nGBD 2016 provides a more detailed understanding of past success and current challenges in improving personal health-care access and quality worldwide.\n\n Despite substantial gains since 2000, many low-SDI and middle-SDI countries face considerable challenges unless heightened policy action and investments focus on advancing access to and quality of health care across key health services, especially non-communicable diseases.\n\n Stagnating or minimal improvements experienced by several low-middle to high-middle SDI countries could reflect the complexities of re-orienting both primary and secondary health-care services beyond the more limited foci of the Millennium Development Goals.\n\n Alongside initiatives to strengthen public health programmes, the pursuit of universal health coverage hinges upon improving both access and quality worldwide, and thus requires adopting a more comprehensive view—and subsequent provision—of quality health care for all populations.\n\n\nFunding\nBill &amp; Melinda Gates

We determined a crystal structure of the MP HA protein at 2.50 Å resolution and two structures of HP HA at 2.95 and 3.10 Å resolution.\n Residues 104 and 115 that modulate the acid stability of the HA

Activation and pH of Fusion: Implications for Host Range and Adaptation","abstract":"The influenza A virus (IAV) HA protein must be activated by host cells proteases in order to prime the molecule for fusion.\n Consequently, the availability of activating proteases and the susceptibility of HA to protease activity represents key factors in facilitating virus infection.\n As such, understanding the intricacies of HA cleavage by various proteases is necessary to derive insights into the emergence of pandemic viruses.\n To examine these properties, we generated a panel of HAs that are representative of the 16 HA subtypes that circulate in aquatic birds, as well as HAs representative of the subtypes that have infected the human population over the last century.\n We examined the susceptibility of the panel of HA proteins to trypsin, as well as human airway trypsin-like protease (HAT) and transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2).\n Additionally, we examined the pH at which these HAs mediated membrane fusion, as this property is related to the stability of the HA molecule and influences the capacity of influenza viruses to remain infectious in natural environments.\n Our results show that cleavage efficiency can vary significantly for individual HAs, depending on the protease, and that some HA subtypes display stringent selectivity for specific proteases as activators of fusion function.\n Additionally, we found that the pH of fusion varies by 0.7 pH units among the subtypes, and notably, we observed that the pH of fusion for most HAs from human isolates was lower than that observed from avian isolates of the same subtype.\n Overall, these data provide the first broad-spectrum analysis of cleavage-activation and membrane fusion characteristics for all of the IAV HA subtypes, and also show that there are substantial differences between the subtypes that may influence transmission among hosts and establishment in new species.\n","id":"PMC3573126","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Summer

transmit efficiently among humans.\n The viral haemagglutinin (HA) protein is a known host range determinant since it mediates virus binding to host-specific cellular receptors1–3.\n Here, we therefore assessed the molecular changes in HA that would allow an H5 HA-possessing virus to transmit among mammals.\n We identified a reassortant virus with H5 HA possessing four mutations in a 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus backbone capable of droplet transmission in a ferret model.\n The transmissible H5 reassortant virus preferentially recognized human-type receptors, replicated efficiently in ferrets, caused lung lesions and weight loss, but it was not highly pathogenic and did not cause mortality.\n These results suggest that H5 HA can convert to an HA that supports efficient viral transmission in mammals.\n However, we do not know whether the four mutations in the H5 HA identified in this study would render a wholly avian H5N1 virus transmissible.\n The genetic origin of the remaining seven viral genes may also critically contribute to transmissibility in mammals.\n Nevertheless, as H5N1 viruses continue to evolve and infect humans, receptor-binding variants of H5N1 viruses with pandemic potential, including avian-human reassortant viruses as tested here, may emerge.\n Our findings emphasize the need for pandemic preparedness for H5 HA-possessing viruses and will

no consistent explanation for influenza’s transmission patterns that applies to both temperate and tropical regions.\n This study aimed to determine the relationship between ambient humidity and viability of the influenza A virus (IAV) during transmission between hosts and to explain the mechanisms underlying it.\n We measured the viability of IAV in droplets consisting of various model media, chosen to isolate effects of salts and proteins found in respiratory fluid, and in human mucus, at relative humidities (RH) ranging from 17% to 100%.\n In all media and mucus, viability was highest when RH was either close to 100% or below ?50%.\n When RH decreased from 84% to 50%, the relationship between viability and RH depended on droplet composition: viability decreased in saline solutions, did not change significantly in solutions supplemented with proteins, and increased dramatically in mucus.\n Additionally, viral decay increased linearly with salt concentration in saline solutions but not when they were supplemented with proteins.\n There appear to be three regimes of IAV viability in droplets, defined by humidity: physiological conditions (?100% RH) with high viability, concentrated conditions (50% to near 100% RH) with lower viability depending on the composition of media, and dry conditions (&lt;50% RH) with high viability.\n This paradigm could help resolve conflicting findings in the literature on the relationship between IAV viability in aerosols and humidity, and results in human mucus could help explain influenza’s seasonality in different

mediating virus infectivity.\n Using the enveloped bacteriophage Phi6, which has been suggested as a surrogate for influenza viruses and coronaviruses, we designed a study to discern whether AH, RH,

mid-range RHs (?60 to 85%).\n At an AH of less than 22 g · m?3, the loss in infectivity was less than 2 orders of magnitude; however, when the AH was greater than 22 g · m?3, the loss in infectivity was typically greater than 6 orders of magnitude.\n At a fixed RH of 75%, infectivity was very sensitive to temperature, decreasing two orders of magnitude between 19°C and 25°C.\n We used random forest modeling to identify the best environmental predictors for modulating virus infectivity.\n The model explained 83% of variation in Phi6 infectivity and suggested that RH is the most important

relative humidity at 20 °C is similar to that previously reported for the stability of influenza viruses (except at high relative humidity, 80%), implying that the effects of humidity act largely at the level of the virus particle.\n For infected guinea pigs housed at 5 °C, the duration of peak shedding was approximately 40 h longer than that of animals housed at 20 °C; this increased shedding likely accounts for the enhanced transmission seen at 5 °C.\n To investigate the mechanism permitting prolonged viral growth, expression levels in the upper respiratory tract of several innate immune mediators were determined.\n Innate responses proved to be comparable between animals housed at 5 °C and 20 °C, suggesting that cold temperature (5 °C) does not impair the innate immune response in

of airborne transmission via aerosols is increased at lower humidities and temperatures, conditions that prevail in wintertime.\n Recent work with a guinea pig model by Lowen et al.\n indicated that humidity and temperature do modulate airborne influenza virus transmission, and several investigators have interpreted the observed humidity dependence in terms of airborne virus survivability.\n This interpretation, however, neglects two key observations: the effect of ambient temperature on the viral growth kinetics within the animals, and the strong influence of the background airflow on transmission.\n Here we provide a comprehensive theoretical framework for assessing the probability of disease transmission via expiratory aerosols between test animals in laboratory conditions.\n The spread of aerosols emitted from an infected animal is modeled using dispersion theory for a homogeneous turbulent airflow.\n The concentration and size distribution of the evaporating droplets in the resulting “Gaussian breath plume” are calculated as functions of position, humidity, and temperature.\n The overall transmission probability is modeled with a combination of the time-dependent viral concentration in the infected animal and the probability of droplet inhalation by the exposed animal downstream.\n We demonstrate that the breath plume model is broadly consistent with the results of Lowen et al.\n, without invoking airborne virus survivability.\n The results also suggest that, at least for guinea pigs, variation in viral kinetics within the infected animals is the dominant factor

droplets suspended on a superhydrophobic surface using optical and fluorescence microscopy.\n When exposed to continuously decreasing RH, droplets of different model respiratory fluids assumed different morphologies.\n Loss of water induced phase separation as well as indication of a decrease in pH.\n The presence of surfactant inhibited the rapid rehydration of the non-volatile components.\n An enveloped virus, ?6, that has been proposed as a surrogate for influenza virus appeared to be homogeneously distributed throughout the dried droplet.\n We hypothesize that the

by aerosols remains controversial, in part, because little is known about the quantity and size of potentially infectious airborne particles produced by people with influenza.\n In this study, the size and amount of aerosol particles produced by nine subjects during coughing were measured while they had influenza and after they had recovered, using a laser aerosol particle spectrometer with a size range of 0.35 to 10 ?m.\n Individuals with influenza produce a significantly greater volume of aerosol when ill compared with afterward (p = 0.0143).\n When the patients had influenza, their average cough aerosol volume was 38.3 picoliters (pL) of particles per cough (SD 43.7); after patients recovered, the average volume was 26.4 pL per cough (SD 45.6).\n The number of particles produced per cough was also higher when subjects had influenza (average 75,400 particles/cough, SD 97,300) compared with afterward (average 52,200, SD 98,600), although the difference did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.1042).\n The average number of particles expelled per cough varied widely from patient to patient, ranging from 900 to 302,200 particles/cough while subjects had influenza and 1100 to 308,600 particles/cough after recovery.\n When the subjects had influenza, an average of 63% of each subject's cough aerosol particle volume in the detection range was in the respirable size fraction (SD 22%), indicating that these particles could reach the alveolar region of the lungs if inhaled by another person.\n This enhancement in aerosol generation during illness may play an important role in influenza transmission and suggests that a better understanding of this phenomenon is needed to predict the production and dissemination of influenza-laden aerosols by people infected with this virus.\n","id":"PMC4676262","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Taylor &amp; Francis","authors":[{"firstname":"William

95% CI 0·09–0·24) of 10?009 people in six of the 13 provinces.\n\n The mean age of seropositive individuals was significantly younger than that of patients with reported, laboratory-confirmed, primary Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (43·5 years [SD 17·3] vs 53·8 years [17·5]; p=0·008).\n\n Men had a higher antibody prevalence than did women (11 [0·25%] of 4341 vs two [0·05%] of 4378; p=0·028) and antibody prevalence was significantly higher in central versus coastal provinces (14 [0·26%] of 5479 vs one [0·02%] of 4529; p=0·003).\n\n Compared with the general population, seroprevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies was significantly increased by 15 times in shepherds (two [2·3%] of 87, p=0·0004) and by 23 times in slaughterhouse workers (five [3·6%] of 140; p&lt;0·0001).\n\n\nInterpretation\nSeroprevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies was significantly higher in camel-exposed individuals than in the general population.\n\n By simple multiplication, a projected 44?951 (95% CI 26?971–71?922) individuals older than 15 years might be seropositive for MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia.\n\n These individuals might be the source of infection for patients with confirmed MERS who had no previous exposure to camels.\n\n\nFunding\nEuropean Union, German Centre for Infection Research, Federal Ministry of Education and Research, German Research Council, and Ministry of Health of Saudi Arabia.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7185864","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Marcel A","surname":"Müller","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Benjamin","surname":"Meyer","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Victor M","surname":"Corman","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Malak","surname":"Al-Masri","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Abdulhafeez","surname":"Turkestani","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Daniel","surname":"Ritz","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Andrea","surname":"Sieberg","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Souhaib","surname":"Aldabbagh","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Berend-J","surname":"Bosch","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Erik","surname":"Lattwein","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Raafat F","surname":"Alhakeem","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Abdullah M","surname":"Assiri","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ali M","surname":"Albarrak","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ali M","surname":"Al-Shangiti","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jaffar A","surname":"Al-Tawfiq","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Paul","surname":"Wikramaratna","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Abdullah A","surname":"Alrabeeah","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Christian","surname":"Drosten","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ziad A","surname":"Memish","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa1401505","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Evidence for camel-to-human transmission of MERS coronavirus","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMsr1408795","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Middle East respiratory syndrome","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"World Health Organization.

Dromedary camels are the only animal species for which there is convincing evidence that it is a host species for MERS?CoV and hence a potential source of human infections.\n However, only a small proportion of the primary cases have reported contact with camels.\n Other possible sources and vehicles of infection include food?borne transmission through consumption of unpasteurized camel milk and raw meat, medicinal use of camel urine and zoonotic transmission from other species.\n There are critical knowledge gaps around this new disease which can only be closed through traditional field epidemiological investigations and studies designed to test hypothesis regarding sources of infection and risk factors for disease.\n Since the 1960s, there has been a radical change in dromedary camel farming practices in the Arabian Peninsula with an intensification of the production and a concentration of the production around cities.\n It is possible that the recent intensification of camel herding in the Arabian Peninsula has increased the virus' reproductive number and attack rate in camel herds while the ‘urbanization’ of camel herding increased the frequency of zoonotic ‘spillover’ infections from camels to humans.\n It is reasonable to assume, although difficult to measure, that the sensitivity of public health surveillance to detect previously unknown diseases is

change on transmission of human infectious diseases","abstract":"Global change, which refers to large-scale changes in the earth system and human society, has been changing the outbreak and transmission mode of many infectious diseases.\n Climate change affects infectious diseases directly and indirectly.\n Meteorological factors including temperature, precipitation, humidity and radiation influence infectious disease by modulating pathogen, host and transmission pathways.\n Meteorological disasters such as droughts and floods directly impact the outbreak and transmission of infectious diseases.\n Climate change indirectly impacts infectious diseases by altering the ecological system, including its underlying surface and vegetation distribution.\n In addition, anthropogenic activities are a driving force for climate change and an indirect forcing of infectious disease transmission.\n International travel and rural-urban migration are a root cause of infectious disease transmission.\n Rapid urbanization along with poor infrastructure and high disease risk in the rural-urban fringe has been changing the pattern of disease outbreaks and mortality.\n Land use changes, such as agricultural expansion and deforestation, have already changed the transmission of infectious disease.\n Accelerated air, road and rail transportation development may not only increase the transmission speed of outbreaks, but also enlarge the scope of transmission area.\n In addition, more frequent trade and other economic activities will also increase the potential risks of disease outbreaks and facilitate the spread of infectious diseases.\n","id":"PMC7104601","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Springer Berlin

Heterogeneity between Japanese Encephalitis Incidence Distribution and Environmental Variables in Nepal","abstract":"Background\nTo identify potential environmental drivers of Japanese Encephalitis virus (JE) transmission in Nepal, we conducted an ecological study to determine the spatial association between 2005 Nepal JE incidence, and climate, agricultural, and land-cover variables at district level.\n\n\nMethods\nDistrict-level data on JE cases were examined using Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) analysis to identify spatial clusters from 2004 to 2008 and 2005 data was used to fit a spatial lag regression model with climate, agriculture and land-cover variables.\n\n\nResults\nPrior to 2006, there was a single large cluster of JE cases located in the Far-West and Mid-West terai regions of Nepal.\n\n After 2005, the distribution of JE cases in Nepal shifted with clusters found in the central hill areas.\n\n JE incidence during the 2005 epidemic had a stronger association with May mean monthly temperature and April mean monthly total precipitation compared to mean annual temperature and precipitation.\n\n A parsimonious spatial lag regression model revealed, 1) a significant negative relationship between JE incidence and April precipitation, 2) a significant positive relationship between JE incidence and percentage of irrigated land 3) a non-significant negative relationship between JE incidence and percentage of grassland cover, and 4) a unimodal non-significant relationship between JE Incidence and pig-to-human ratio.\n\n\nConclusion\nJE cases clustered in the terai prior to 2006 where it seemed to shift to the Kathmandu region in subsequent years.\n\n The spatial pattern of JE cases during the 2005 epidemic in Nepal was significantly associated with low precipitation and the percentage of irrigated land.\n\n Despite the availability of an effective vaccine, it is still important to understand environmental drivers of JEV transmission since the enzootic cycle of JEV transmission is not likely to be totally interrupted.\n\n Understanding the spatial dynamics of JE risk factors may be useful in providing important information to the Nepal immunization program.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3141013","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

malaria incidence in these areas of unstable malaria transmission has been attributed to a variety of changes including global warming.\n To determine whether the reemergence of malaria in western Kenya could be attributed to changes in meteorologic conditions, we tested for trends in a continuous 30-year monthly malaria incidence dataset (1966–1995) obtained from complete hospital registers at a Kenyan tea plantation.\n Contemporary monthly meteorologic data (1966–1995) that originated from the tea estate meteorologic station and from global climatology records were also tested for trends.\n We found that total hospital admissions (malaria and nonmalaria) remained unchanged while malaria admissions increased significantly during the period.\n We also found that all meteorologic

The sole isolate obtained from the cerebrospinal fluid showed unique changes in nsP1 (T301I), nsP2 (Y642N), and nsP3 (E460 deletion), not obtained from isolates from sera.\n\n In the structural proteins region, two noteworthy changes (A226V and D284E) were observed in the membrane fusion glycoprotein E1. Homology 3D modelling allowed mapping of these two changes to regions that are important for membrane fusion and virion assembly.\n\n Change E1-A226V was absent in the initial strains but was observed in &gt;90% of subsequent viral sequences from Réunion, denoting evolutionary success possibly due to adaptation to the mosquito vector.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe unique molecular features of the analyzed

performed at relative humidities from 20% to 80% and 5 °C, 20 °C, or 30 °C indicated that both cold and dry conditions favor transmission.\n The relationship between transmission via aerosols and relative humidity at 20 °C is similar to that previously reported for the stability of influenza viruses (except at high relative humidity, 80%), implying that the effects of humidity act largely at the level of the virus particle.\n For infected guinea pigs housed at 5 °C, the duration of peak shedding was approximately 40 h longer than that of animals housed at 20 °C; this increased shedding likely accounts for the enhanced transmission seen at 5 °C.\n To investigate the mechanism permitting prolonged viral growth, expression levels in the upper respiratory tract of several innate immune mediators were determined.\n Innate responses proved to be comparable between animals housed at 5 °C and 20 °C, suggesting that cold temperature (5 °C) does not impair the innate immune response in this system.\n Although the seasonal epidemiology of influenza is well characterized, the underlying reasons for predominant wintertime spread are not clear.\n We provide direct, experimental evidence

the pathogen, vector, and host, the potential influence of climate change on vector-borne and zoonotic diseases (VBZDs) is poorly understood and difficult to predict.\n\n Climate effects on the nonvector-borne zoonotic diseases are especially obscure and have received scant treatment.\n\n\nObjective\nWe described known and potential effects of climate change on VBZDs and proposed specific studies to increase our understanding of these effects.\n\n The nonvector-borne zoonotic diseases have received scant treatment and are emphasized in this paper.\n\n\nData sources and synthesis\nWe used a review of the existing literature and extrapolations from observations of short-term climate variation to suggest potential impacts of climate change on VBZDs.\n\n Using public health priorities on climate change, published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we developed six specific goals for increasing understanding of the interaction between climate and VBZDs and for improving capacity for predicting climate change effects on incidence and distribution of VBZDs.\n\n\nConclusions\nClimate change may affect the incidence of VBZDs through its effect on four principal characteristics of host and vector populations that relate to pathogen transmission to humans: geographic distribution, population density, prevalence of infection by zoonotic pathogens, and the pathogen load in individual hosts and vectors.\n\n These mechanisms may interact with each other and with other factors such as anthropogenic disturbance to produce varying effects on pathogen transmission within host and vector populations and to humans.\n\n Because climate change effects on most VBZDs act through wildlife hosts and vectors, understanding these effects will require multidisciplinary teams to conduct and interpret ecosystem-based studies of VBZD pathogens in host and vector populations and to identify the hosts, vectors, and pathogens with the greatest potential to affect human populations under climate change scenarios.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2974686","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"National Institute of Environmental Health

in the geographical distribution and abundance of the tick <italic>Ixodes ricinus </italic>during the past 30 years in Sweden","abstract":"Background\nIxodes ricinus is the main vector in Europe of human-pathogenic Lyme borreliosis (LB) spirochaetes, the tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) and other pathogens of humans and domesticated mammals.\n\n The results of a previous 1994 questionnaire, directed at people living in Central and North Sweden (Svealand and Norrland) and aiming to gather information about tick exposure for humans and domestic animals, suggested that Ixodes ricinus ticks had become more widespread in Central Sweden and the southern part of North Sweden from the early 1980s to the early 1990s.\n\n To investigate whether the expansion of the tick's northern geographical range and the increasing abundance of ticks in Sweden were still occurring, in 2009 we performed a follow-up survey 16 years after the initial study.\n\n\nMethods\nA questionnaire similar to the one used in the 1994 study was published in Swedish magazines aimed at dog owners, home owners, and hunters.\n\n The questionnaire was published together with a popular science article about the tick's biology and role as a pathogen vector in Sweden.\n\n The magazines were selected to get information from people familiar with ticks and who spend time in areas where ticks might be present.\n\n\nResults\nAnalyses of data from both surveys revealed that during the near 30-year period from the early 1980s to 2008, I.\n\n ricinus has expanded its distribution range northwards.\n\n In the early 1990s ticks were found in new areas along the northern coastline of the Baltic Sea, while in the 2009 study, ticks were reported for the first time from many locations in North Sweden.\n\n This included locations as far north as 66°N and places in the interior part of North Sweden.\n\n During this 16-year period the tick's range in Sweden was estimated to have increased by 9.9%.\n\n Most of the range expansion occurred in North Sweden (north of 60°N) where the tick's coverage area doubled from 12.5% in the early 1990s to 26.8% in 2008. Moreover, according to the respondents, the abundance of ticks had increased markedly in LB- and TBE-endemic areas in South (Götaland) and Central Sweden.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe results suggest that I.\n\n ricinus has expanded its range in North Sweden and has become distinctly more abundant in Central and South Sweden during the last three decades.\n\n However, in the northern mountain region I.\n\n ricinus is still absent.\n\n The increased abundance of the tick can be explained by two main factors: First, the high availability of large numbers of important tick maintenance hosts, i.\n\ne.\n\n, cervids, particularly roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) during the last three decades.\n\n Second, a warmer climate with milder winters and a prolonged growing season that permits greater survival and proliferation over a larger geographical area of both the tick itself and deer.\n\n High reproductive potential of roe deer, high tick infestation rate and the tendency of roe deer to disperse great distances may explain the range expansion of I.\n\n ricinus and particularly the appearance of new TBEV foci far away from old TBEV-endemic localities.\n\n The geographical presence of LB in Sweden corresponds to the distribution of I.\n\n ricinus.\n\n Thus, LB is now an emerging disease risk in many parts of North Sweden.\n\n Unless countermeasures are undertaken to keep the deer populations, particularly C.\n\n capreolus and Dama dama, at the relatively low levels that prevailed before the late 1970s - especially in and around urban areas where human population density is high - by e.\n\ng.\n\n reduced hunting of red fox (Vulpes vulpes) and lynx (Lynx lynx), the incidences of human LB and TBE are expected to continue to be high or even to increase in Sweden in coming decades.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3311093","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Thomas

35?±?1°C), 75?±?5% relative humidity.\n\n Upon emergence into imagoes, individual adult females were either left at their larval temperature or placed at a different temperature within the range

Orbiviruses in <italic>Culicoides</italic> Biting Midges","abstract":"Background\nThe rate at which viruses replicate and disseminate in competent arthropod vectors is limited by the temperature of their environment, and this can be an important determinant of geographical and seasonal limits to their transmission by arthropods in temperate regions.\n\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nHere, we present a novel statistical methodology for estimating the relationship between temperature and the extrinsic incubation period (EIP) and apply it to both published and novel data on virus replication for three internationally important orbiviruses (African horse sickness virus (AHSV), bluetongue virus (BTV) and epizootic haemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV)) in their Culicoides vectors.\n\n Our analyses show that there can be differences in vector competence for different orbiviruses in the same vector species and for the same orbivirus in different vector species.\n\n Both the rate of virus replication (approximately 0.017-0.021 per degree-day) and the minimum temperature required for replication (11-13°C), however, were generally consistent for different orbiviruses and across different Culicoides vector species.\n\n The estimates obtained in the present study suggest that previous publications have underestimated the replication rate and threshold temperature because the statistical methods they used included an implicit assumption that all negative vectors were infected.\n\n\nConclusions/Significance\nRobust estimates of the temperature dependence of arbovirus replication are essential for building accurate models of transmission and for informing policy decisions about seasonal relaxations to movement restrictions.\n\n The methodology developed in this study provides the required robustness and is superior to methods used previously.\n\n Importantly, the methods are generic and can readily be applied to other arbovirus-vector systems, as long as the assumptions described in the text are valid.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3220716","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

With spatiotemporal transmission along each route, genetic distances to isolate A/goose/Guangdong/1996 are becoming significantly larger, leading to a more challenging situation in certain regions like Korea, India, France, Germany, Nigeria and Sudan.\n\n Europe and India have had at least two incursions along multiple routes, causing a mixed virus situation.\n\n In addition, spatiotemporal distribution along the routes showed that 2007/2008 was a temporal separation point for the infection of different host species; specifically, wild birds were the main host in 2005–2007/2008 and poultry was responsible for the genetic mutation in 2009–2011. “Global-to-local” and “high-to-low latitude” transmission footprints have been observed.\n\n\nConclusions\nOur results suggest that both

Factors for Infectious Diseases in Backyard Poultry Farms in the Poyang Lake Area, China","abstract":"Emergence and transmission of infectious diseases have an enormous impact on the poultry industry and present a serious threat to the health of humans and wild birds.\n Noncommercial poultry operations, such as backyard poultry facilities in China, are potential sources of virus exchange between commercial poultry and wild birds.\n It is particularly critical in wetland areas where backyard poultry have close contact with commercial poultry and migratory birds, therefore increasing the risk of contracting infectious diseases.\n To evaluate the transmission risks, a cross-sectional study was undertaken in the Poyang Lake area, China, involving 309 residents in the backyard poultry farms in three counties (Region A, B, and C) of Jiangxi Province.\n We examined the backyard poultry population, poultry species, presence of poultry deaths from infectious diseases, food sources, and biosecurity practices.\n Region B ranked highest for biosecurity while region C ranked lowest.\n The risks of infectious diseases were assessed by adjusted odds ratio based on multivariate logistic regression analysis.\n Potential risk factors in the three regions of the study site were compared.\n In Region A, significant factor was contact of poultry with wild birds (OR: 6.573, 95% CI: 2.148–20.115, P=0.001).\n In Region B, the most significant factor was contact of poultry with neighboring backyard waterfowls (OR: 3.967, 95% CI: 1.555–10.122, P=0.004).\n In Region C, significant factors were poultry purchase from local live bird markets (OR: 3.740, 95% CI: 1.243–11.255, P=0.019), and contact of poultry with wild birds (OR: 3.379, 95% CI: 1.058–10.791, P=0.040).\n In summary, backyard poultry was significantly affected by neighboring commercial poultry and close contact with wild birds.\n The results are expected to improve our understanding of the transmission risks of infectious diseases in a typical backyard poultry environment in rural China, and address the need to improve local farming practices and take preventive measures.\n","id":"PMC3688663","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

climate change, but there are competing views on what responsibilities and obligations this will—or should—include in different nations.\n This study aims to: (1) examine how national-level public health adaptation is occurring in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries; (2) examine the roles national governments are taking in public health adaptation; and (3) critically appraise three key governance dimensions of national-level health adaptation—cross-sectoral collaboration, vertical coordination and national health adaptation planning—and identify practical examples suited to different contexts.\n We systematically reviewed publicly available public health adaptation to climate change documents and webpages by national governments in ten OECD countries using systematic web searches, assessment of self-reporting, and content analysis.\n Our findings suggest national governments are primarily addressing infectious disease and heat-related risks posed by climate change, typically emphasizing capacity building or information-based groundwork initiatives.\n We find national governments are taking a variety of approaches to public health adaptation to climate change that do not follow expected convergence and divergence by governance structure.\n We discuss practical options for incorporating cross-sectoral collaboration, vertical coordination and national health adaptation planning into a variety of contexts and identify leaders national governments can look to to inform their public health adaptation planning.\n Following the adoption of the Paris Agreement and subsequent increased momentum for adaptation, research tracking adaptation is needed to define what health adaptation looks like in practice, reveal insights that

population ageing are significant public health challenges.\n\n Understanding which health problems are affected by temperature is important for preventing heat and cold-related deaths and illnesses, particularly in the elderly.\n\n Here we present a systematic review and meta-analysis on the effects of ambient hot and cold temperature (excluding heat/cold wave only studies) on elderly (65 + years) mortality and morbidity.\n\n\nMethods\nTime-series or case-crossover studies comprising cause-specific cases of elderly mortality (n = 3,933,398) or morbidity (n = 12,157,782) were pooled to obtain a percent change (%) in risk for temperature exposure on cause-specific disease outcomes using a random-effects meta-analysis.\n\n\nResults\nA 1 °C temperature rise increased cardiovascular (3.44%, 95% CI 3.10–3.78), respiratory (3.60%, 3.18–4.02), and cerebrovascular (1.40%, 0.06–2.75) mortality.\n\n A 1 °C temperature reduction increased respiratory (2.90%, 1.84–3.97) and cardiovascular (1.66%, 1.19–2.14) mortality.\n\n The greatest risk was associated with cold-induced pneumonia (6.89%, 20–12.99) and respiratory morbidity (4.93% 1.54–8.44).\n\n A 1 °C temperature rise increased cardiovascular, respiratory, diabetes mellitus, genitourinary, infectious disease and heat-related morbidity.\n\n\nDiscussion\nElevated risks for the elderly were prominent for temperature-induced cerebrovascular, cardiovascular, diabetes, genitourinary, infectious disease, heat-related, and respiratory outcomes.\n\n These risks will likely increase with climate change and

performed at relative humidities from 20% to 80% and 5 °C, 20 °C, or 30 °C indicated that both cold and dry conditions favor transmission.\n The relationship between transmission via aerosols and relative humidity at 20 °C is similar to that previously reported for the stability of influenza viruses (except at high relative humidity, 80%), implying that the effects of humidity act largely at the level of the virus particle.\n For infected guinea pigs housed at 5 °C, the duration of peak shedding was approximately 40 h longer than that of animals housed at 20 °C; this increased shedding likely accounts for the enhanced transmission seen at 5 °C.\n To investigate the mechanism permitting prolonged viral growth, expression levels in the upper respiratory tract of several innate immune mediators were determined.\n Innate responses proved to be comparable between animals housed at 5 °C and 20 °C, suggesting that cold temperature (5 °C) does not impair the innate immune response in this system.\n Although the seasonal epidemiology of influenza is well characterized, the underlying reasons for predominant wintertime spread are not clear.\n We provide direct, experimental evidence to support the role of weather conditions in the dynamics of influenza and thereby address a long-standing question fundamental to the understanding of influenza epidemiology and

is associated with daily disease-specific mortality, and how season might modify any association.\n\n\nObjectives\nTo better understand the acute effect of DTR on mortality and identify whether season is a modifier of the DTR effect.\n\n\nMethods\nThe distributed lag nonlinear model (DLNM) was applied to assess the non-linear and delayed effects of DTR on deaths (non-accidental mortality (NAD), cardiovascular disease (CVD), respiratory disease (RD) and cerebrovascular disease (CBD)) in the full year, the cold season and the warm season.\n\n\nResults\nA non-linear relationship was consistently found between extreme DTR and mortality.\n\n Immediate effects of extreme low DTR on all types of mortality were stronger than those of extreme high DTR in the full year.\n\n The cumulative effects of extreme DTRs increased with the increment of lag days for all types of mortality in cold season, and they were greater for extreme high DTRs than those of extreme low DTRs.\n\n In hot season, the cumulative effects for extreme low DTRs increased with the increment of lag days, but for extreme high DTR they reached maxima at a lag of 13 days for all types of mortality except for CBD(at lag6 days), and then decreased.\n\n\nConclusions\nOur findings suggest that extreme DTR is an independent risk factor of daily mortality, and season is a modifier of the association of DTR

Three methodologies were used to evaluate the isolated association: time-series analysis using Poisson regression model, bidirectional case-crossover analysis matched by period, and case-crossover analysis matched by the confounding factor, i.\n\ne.\n\n, average temperature or pollutant concentration.\n\n The graphical representation of the response surface, generated by the interaction term between these factors added to the Poisson regression model, was interpreted to evaluate the synergistic effect of the risk factors.\n\n\nRESULTS\nNo differences were observed between the results of the case-crossover and time-series analyses.\n\n The percentage change in the relative risk of cardiovascular and respiratory mortality was 0.85% (0.45;1.25) and 1.60% (0.74;2.46), respectively, due to an increase of 10 ?g/m3 in the PM10 concentration.\n\n The pattern of correlation of the temperature with cardiovascular mortality was U-shaped and that with respiratory mortality was J-shaped, indicating an increased relative risk at high temperatures.\n\n The values for the interaction term indicated a higher relative risk for cardiovascular and respiratory mortalities at low temperatures

concentration is not confounded by temperature, and the effect of temperature is not confounded by the pollutant levels in the time-series analysis.\n\n The simultaneous exposure to different levels

2003 SARS epidemic","abstract":"Since the emergence of HIV/AIDS in the 1980s, social scientists and sociologists of health and illness have been exploring the metaphorical framing of this infectious disease in its social context.\n Many have focused on the militaristic language used to report and explain this illness, a type of language that has permeated discourses of immunology, bacteriology and infection for at least a century.\n In this article, we examine how language and metaphor were used in the UK media's coverage of another previously unknown and severe infectious disease: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).\n SARS offers an opportunity to explore the cultural framing of a less extraordinary epidemic disease.\n It therefore provides an analytical counter-weight to the very extensive body of interpretation that has developed around HIV/AIDS.\n By analysing the total reporting on SARS of five major national newspapers during the epidemic of spring 2003, we investigate how the reporting of SARS in the UK press was framed, and how this related to media, public and governmental responses to the disease.\n We found that, surprisingly, militaristic language was largely absent, as was the judgemental discourse of plague.\n Rather, the main conceptual metaphor used was SARS as a killer.\n SARS as a killer was a single unified entity, not an army or force.\n We provide some tentative explanations for this shift in linguistic framing by relating it to local political concerns, media cultures, and spatial factors.\n","id":"PMC7117051","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

that the number of cases in the Southern Hemisphere near the end of summer are low; that vitamin D deficiency has been found to contribute to acute respiratory distress syndrome; and that case-fatality rates increase with age and with chronic disease comorbidity, both of which are associated with lower 25(OH)D concentration.\n To reduce the risk of infection, it is recommended that people at risk of influenza and/or COVID-19 consider taking 10,000 IU/d of vitamin D3 for a few weeks to rapidly raise 25(OH)D concentrations, followed by 5000 IU/d.\n The goal should be to raise 25(OH)D concentrations above 40–60 ng/mL (100–150 nmol/L).\n For treatment of people who become infected with COVID-19, higher vitamin D3 doses might be useful.\n Randomized controlled trials and large population studies should be conducted to evaluate these recommendations.\n","id":"PMC7231123","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"William B.","surname":"Grant","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Henry","surname":"Lahore","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Henry","surname":"Lahore","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sharon L.","surname":"McDonnell","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Carole A.","surname":"Baggerly","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Christine B.","surname":"French","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Christine B.","surname":"French","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jennifer L.","surname":"Aliano","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Jennifer L.","surname":"Aliano","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Harjit P.","surname":"Bhattoa","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Panorama Rio de Janeiro","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Ventilation of wards and nosocomial outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome among healthcare workers","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138513","date":"2020-04-05","title":"Impact of meteorological factors on the COVID-19 transmission: A multi-city study in China","abstract":"The purpose of the present study is to explore the associations between novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) case counts and meteorological factors in 30 provincial capital cities of China.\n We compiled a daily dataset including confirmed case counts, ambient temperature (AT), diurnal temperature range (DTR), absolute humidity (AH) and migration scale index (MSI) for each city during the period of January 20th to March 2nd, 2020. First, we explored the associations between COVID-19 confirmed case counts, meteorological factors, and MSI using non-linear regression.\n Then, we conducted a two-stage analysis for 17 cities with more than 50 confirmed cases.\n In the first stage, generalized linear models with negative binomial distribution were fitted to estimate city-specific effects of meteorological factors on confirmed case counts.\n In the second stage, the meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the pooled effects.\n Our results showed that among 13 cities that have less than 50 confirmed cases, 9 cities locate in the Northern China with average AT below 0 °C, 12 cities had average AH below 4 g/m3, and one city (Haikou) had the highest AH (14.05 g/m3).\n Those 17 cities with 50 and more cases accounted for 90.6% of all cases in our study.\n Each 1 °C increase in AT and DTR was related to the decline of daily confirmed case counts, and the corresponding pooled RRs were 0.80 (95% CI: 0.75, 0.85) and 0.90 (95% CI: 0.86, 0.95), respectively.\n For AH, the association with COVID-19 case counts were statistically significant in lag 07 and lag 014.

transmission, or survival; however, there are contradictory claims about whether absolute humidity (AH) or relative humidity (RH) is most important in mediating virus infectivity.\n Using the enveloped bacteriophage Phi6, which has been suggested as a surrogate for influenza viruses and coronaviruses, we designed a study to discern whether AH, RH, or temperature is a better predictor of virus survival in droplets.\n Our results show that Phi6 survived best at high (&gt;85%) and low (&lt;60%) RHs, with a significant decrease in infectivity at mid-range RHs (?60 to 85%).\n At an AH of less than 22 g · m?3, the loss in infectivity was less than 2 orders of magnitude; however, when the AH was greater than 22 g · m?3, the loss in infectivity was typically greater than 6 orders of magnitude.\n At a fixed RH of 75%, infectivity was very sensitive to temperature, decreasing two orders of magnitude between 19°C and 25°C.\n We used random forest modeling to identify the best environmental predictors for modulating virus infectivity.\n The model explained 83% of variation in Phi6 infectivity and suggested that RH is the most important factor in controlling virus infectivity in droplets.\n This research provides novel information about the complex interplay between temperature, humidity, and the survival of viruses in

Temperate and Tropical Climates","abstract":"Human influenza infections exhibit a strong seasonal cycle in temperate regions.\n Recent laboratory and epidemiological evidence suggests that low specific humidity conditions facilitate the airborne survival and transmission of the influenza virus in temperate regions, resulting in annual winter epidemics.\n However, this relationship is unlikely to account for the epidemiology of influenza in tropical and subtropical regions where epidemics often occur during the rainy season or transmit year-round without a well-defined season.\n We assessed the role of specific humidity and other local climatic variables on influenza virus seasonality by modeling epidemiological and climatic information from 78 study sites sampled globally.\n We substantiated that there are two types of environmental conditions associated with seasonal influenza epidemics: “cold-dry” and “humid-rainy”.\n For sites where monthly average specific humidity or temperature decreases below thresholds of approximately 11–12 g/kg and 18–21°C during the year, influenza activity peaks during the cold-dry season (i.\ne.\n, winter) when specific humidity and temperature are at minimal levels.\n For sites where specific humidity and temperature do not decrease below these thresholds, seasonal influenza activity is more likely to peak in months when average precipitation totals are maximal and greater than 150 mm per month.\n These findings provide a simple climate-based model rooted in empirical data that accounts for the diversity of seasonal influenza patterns observed across temperate, subtropical and tropical climates.\n","id":"PMC3591336","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"James

South-East Queensland, Australia: an observational study","abstract":"Objective\nFoodborne illnesses in Australia, including salmonellosis, are estimated to cost over $A1.25 billion annually.\n\n The weather has been identified as being influential on salmonellosis incidence, as cases increase during summer, however time series modelling of salmonellosis is challenging because outbreaks cause strong autocorrelation.\n\n This study assesses whether switching models is an improved method of estimating weather–salmonellosis associations.\n\n\nDesign\nWe analysed weather and salmonellosis in South-East Queensland between 2004 and 2013 using 2 common regression models and a switching model, each with 21-day lags for temperature and precipitation.\n\n\nResults\nThe switching model best fit the data, as judged by its substantial improvement in deviance information criterion over the regression models, less autocorrelated residuals and control of seasonality.\n\n The switching model estimated a 5°C increase in mean temperature and 10?mm precipitation were associated with increases in salmonellosis cases of 45.4% (95% CrI 40.4%, 50.5%) and 24.1% (95% CrI 17.0%, 31.6%), respectively.\n\n\nConclusions\nSwitching models improve on traditional time series models in quantifying weather–salmonellosis associations.\n\n A better understanding of how temperature and precipitation influence salmonellosis may identify where interventions can be made to lower the health and economic costs of salmonellosis.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4769393","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BMJ Publishing Group","authors":[{"firstname":"Dimity

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

The implementation of strict measures for social distancing is challenging, including in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) due to its level of urbanization, its social and religious norms and its annual hosting of high visibility international religious mass gatherings.\n KSA started introducing decisive social distancing measures early before the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in the Kingdom.\n These ranged from suspension or cancelations of religious, entertainment and sporting mass gatherings and events such as the Umrah, temporary closure of educational establishments and mosques and postponing all non-essential gatherings, to imposing a curfew.\n These measures were taken in spite of their socio-economic, political and religious challenges in the interest of public and global health.\n The effect of these actions on the epidemic curve of the Kingdom and on the global fight against COVID-19 remains to be seen.\n However, given the current COVID-19 situation, further bold and probably unpopular measures are likely to be introduced in the future.\n","id":"PMC7172679","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome

the pneumonia outbreak caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were based on information from the general population.\n\n Limited data are available for pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in pregnancy and the intrauterine vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 infection.\n\n\nMethods\nClinical records, laboratory results, and chest CT scans were retrospectively reviewed for nine pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia (ie, with maternal throat swab samples that were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) who were admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, from Jan 20 to Jan 31, 2020. Evidence of intrauterine vertical transmission was assessed by testing for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in amniotic fluid, cord blood, and neonatal throat swab samples.\n\n Breastmilk samples were also collected and tested from patients after the first lactation.\n\n\nFindings\nAll nine patients had a caesarean section in their third trimester.\n\n Seven patients presented with a fever.\n\n Other symptoms, including cough (in four of nine patients), myalgia (in three), sore throat (in two), and malaise (in two), were also observed.\n\n Fetal distress was monitored in two cases.\n\n Five of nine patients had lymphopenia (&lt;1·0?×?10? cells per L).\n\n Three patients had increased aminotransferase concentrations.\n\n None of the patients developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died, as of Feb 4, 2020. Nine livebirths were recorded.\n\n No neonatal asphyxia was observed in newborn babies.\n\n All nine livebirths had a 1-min Apgar score of 8–9 and a 5-min Apgar score of 9–10. Amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk samples from six patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and all samples tested negative for the virus.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe clinical characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women were similar to those reported for non-pregnant adult patients who developed COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n Findings from this small group of cases suggest that there is currently no evidence for intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission in women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy.\n\n\nFunding\nHubei Science and

coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing Municipal Science and Technology

important to reduce the number of COVID-19 cases while effective vaccines and therapeutics are under development.\n SARS-CoV-2 transmission is thought to primarily occur through direct person-to-person transfer of infectious respiratory droplets or through aerosol-generating medical procedures.\n However, contact with contaminated surfaces may also play a significant role.\n In this context, understanding the factors contributing to SARS-CoV-2 persistence on surfaces will enable a more accurate estimation of the risk of contact transmission and inform mitigation strategies.\n To this end, we have developed a simple mathematical model that can be used to estimate virus decay on nonporous surfaces under a range of conditions and which may be utilized operationally to identify indoor environments in which the virus is most persistent.\n","id":"PMC7333574","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"American Society for
