arrests\nAbstract\nAims\nAn increase in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) incidence has been reported in the very early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic, but a clear demonstration of a correlation between the increased incidence of OHCA and COVID-19 is missing so far. We aimed to verify whether there is an association between the OHCA difference compared with 2019 and the COVID-19 epidemic curve.\nMethods and results\nWe included all the consecutive OHCAs which occurred in the Provinces of Lodi, Cremona, Pavia, and Mantova in the 2 months following the first documented case of COVID-19 in the Lombardia Region and compared them with those which occurred in the same time frame in 2019.

A strong and statistically significant correlation was found between the difference in cumulative incidence of OHCA between 2020 and 2019 per 100 000 inhabitants and the COVID-19 cumulative incidence per 100 000 inhabitants both for the overall territory (rho 0.87, P &lt; 0.001) and for each province separately (Lodi: rho 0.98, P &lt; 0.001; Cremona: rho 0.98, P &lt; 0.001; Pavia: rho 0.87, P &lt; 0.001; Mantova: rho 0.81, P &lt; 0.001).\nConclusion\nThe increase in OHCAs in 2020 is significantly correlated to the COVID-19 pandemic and is coupled with a reduction in short-term outcome. Government and local health authorities should seriously consider our results when planning healthcare strategies to face the epidemic, especially considering the expected recurrent outbreaks.\nGraphical Abstract\nIntroduction\nA novel coronavirus, capable of human to-human transmission, emerged in China at the end of 2019 and was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The resulting infection, called 'Coronavirus disease 2019' (COVID-19), has a wide spectrum of severity, from asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic patients to patients with severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring mechanical ventilation. Northern Italy was one of the first regions outside China to be significantly affected by COVID-19. The first case of severe pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2 without history of possible exposure abroad was diagnosed in Codogno, Province of Lodi, Lombardy Region on 20 February 2020. Since then, the number of infections has been rapidly increasing, with a mortality rate higher than that of China, and an increase in incidence of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) in the very early phase of the epidemic also being reported. However, the correlation between the increase in OHCAs observed in 2020 and the COVID-19 epidemic curve still remain unproved. Our aim was to assess whether the difference in the number of OHCAs between 2020 and 2019 was statistically correlated with the COVID-19 epidemic trend and to look for clinical pre-hospital elements supporting this evidence.\nMethods\nStudy population\nThe Lombardia Cardiac Arrest Registry (Lombardia CARe: NCT03197142) is a multicentre longitudinal prospective registry that has been registering all the OHCAs from the Province of Pavia since January 2015 and additionally from the Provinces of Lodi, Cremona, and Mantua Pavia since January 2019. All the data are collected following Utstein 2014 recommendations. It was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Fondazione IRCSS Policlinico San Matteo (proc. 20140028219) and by all the others involved in the territory.\nWe considered all the OHCAs that occurred in these four provinces in the southern part of the Lombardy Region, in northern Italy, in the 2 months following the first documented case in the Lombardy Region (21 February 2020 to 20 April 2020) and those of the same time frame in 2019 (21 February 2019 to 21 April 2019, to account for the leap year). For the Province of Pavia, the mean value of OHCAs that occurred in the same time frame from 2015 to 2019 was also provided as historical reference. The daily new cases and the cumulative incidence of COVID-19, based on the confirmed cases announced by the National Department of Civil Defence/Protezione Civile Nazionale, were also computed.\nAll the Emergency Medical System (EMS) electronic records have been reanalysed and the number of patients with suspected COVID-19 (fever for at least 3 days before OHCA associated with cough and/or dyspnoea) or with a diagnostic pharyngeal swab (performed before OHCA or after death) have been computed. Moreover, among the patients with suspected or diagnosed COVID-19, eventual gastrointestinal symptoms (vomiting or diarrhoea for at least 3 days) were assessed.\nAll the ECGs acquired in the field after the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) were evaluated for OHCA patients in 2020, and the QTc value was calculated with Bazett's formula. QTc was defined as prolonged if longer than 440 ms in males and 460 ms in females.\nWe also counted the number of emergency calls received by the EMS dispatch centre and the resulting number of callouts for any pathology for both the 2020 and 2019 study periods. Among those, we counted, and compared with the previous year, those leading to a pre-hospital diagnosis of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) according to the criteria recommended by the 2017 guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology.\nData management\nThe data of the study are collected and managed using REDCap electronic data capture tools hosted at Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo. REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) is a secure, web-based software platform designed to support data capture for research studies, providing (i) an intuitive interface for validated data capture; (ii) audit trails for tracking data manipulation and export procedures; (iii) automated export procedures for seamless data downloads to common statistical packages; and (iv) procedures for data integration and interoperability with external sources.\nStatistical analysis\nWe present categorical variables as counts and percentage; we computed the difference in percentage between 2020 and 2019 together with its 95% confidence interval (CI) using a binomial regression model with identity link. We present continuous variables using the median and 25th-75th percentiles; we computed the difference in medians and 95% CI using quantile regression. We computed the Spearman R and its 95% CI to measure the strength of the correlation of difference in cumulative incidence in OHCAs between 2020 and 2019 per 100 000 inhabitants and COVID-19 cumulative incidence per 100 000 inhabitants for the entire series and for each province. To assess whether the 2020-2019 difference in incidence over time of OHCA paralleled that of COVID-19 in 2020, we used fractional polynomials within a generalized regression linear model to model the relationship of these two variables, and plotted the fitted and observed values. We assessed the interaction of the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 and OHCA difference and fitted the same models separately for each province. Given the risk of overfitting, these models are to be considered exploratory. Statistical analyses were performed with the MedCalc version 19.2 (MedCalc Software Ltd) and the Stata software (version 16, StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). All tests were two-sided, and a P-value &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nEMS adaptation to the COVID-19 outbreak\nDuring the COVID-19 outbreak, the number of BLS-D- and ALS-trained staffed vehicles increased by 40% (from 45 to 63) and by 29% (from 21 to 27), respectively. The EMS dispatchers and personnel were instructed to investigate for any possible symptoms related to COVID-19, both during the emergency call and at the patient's side from the caller, the relatives, and the eventual bystanders. Moreover, EMS personnel had been instructed to wear personal protective equipment (PPE; face shield, N95 face mask, and isolation gown) before starting resuscitation in case of doubt or if diagnosed for COVID-19. No specific changes in BLS or ALS protocols were adopted during the COVID-19 epidemic. See the Supplementary material online for details of the EMS description.\nResults\nThe cumulative incidence of COVID-19 from 21 February to 20 April 2020 in the territory of the study was 956 COVID-19/100 000 inhabitants (Lodi 1190; Cremona 1529; Pavia 667; Mantua 706) and the cumulative incidence of OHCA was 31.7 cases/100 000 inhabitants, with a 52% increase compared with 2019 (490 OHCA in 2020 vs. 321 in 2019).\nThe increase in OHCA cases per 100 000 inhabitants was confirmed in each province, even if with different magnitude, according to the start of the epidemic (Lodi: +169%; Cremona: +106%; Pavia: +31%; Mantua: +12%) (Table 1). Notably, when considering the Province of Pavia as the historical reference, the mean incidence of OHCAs per 100 000 in the study period from 2015 to 2019 was 21.5 cases (95% CI 18.2-24.7).\nRelationship of COVID-19 per 100 000 inhabitants and OHCA difference between 2020 and 2019 cumulative incidences per 100 000 from days 1 to 60\nDescription	Model with fractional polynomials	 	Province	Cumulative incidence per 100 000	% increase	Cumulative incidence per 100 000	Spearman's rho	95% CI	P-value	 		2020 OHCA	2019 OHCA		COVID-19				 	All*	31.7	20.8	+52%	956	0.87	0.84-0.9	&lt;0.001	 	Lodi	38.7	14.4	+169%	1,190	0.98	0.97-0.99	&lt;0.001	 	Cremona	31.5	15.3	+106%	1,529	0.98	0.97-0.99	&lt;0.001	 	Pavia	34.1	26	+31%	667	0.88	0.8-0.92	&lt;0.001	 	Mantova	24.7	22.1	+12%	706	0.81	0.7-0.88	&lt;0.001	 	\n\nP for interaction with province &lt;0.001.\nCorrelation between OHCA excess in 2020 and COVID-19\nStatistical correlation\nA strong and statistically significant correlation was found between the difference in cases of OHCA between 2020 and 2019 per 100 000 inhabitants and the trend of COVID-19 cumulative incidence per 100 000 inhabitants, both for the overall territory. In all cases, the association was strong, with a Spearman rho &gt;0.80 both for the entire case series and for each province (Table 1). Graphically, the overall association was best described by a polynomial including a square root followed by cubic transformation of the original variable. As a strong modifying effect by province of the relationship of the OHCA difference and COVID-19 cumulative incidence was present (P for interaction &lt;0.001), we described each province separately; each had a different shape and slope of the corresponding curve (Figure 1).\n\n(A) Over a period of 60 days from 20 February, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 per 100 000 inhabitants in the four provinces and in the overall territory (dotted line) (upper part), and the trend of the difference of OHCA between 2020 and 2019 per 100 000 inhabitants in the four provinces and in the overall territory (dotted line) (bottom part).

Dots are the observed values. The red line is the function fitted using fractional polynomials. The shaded area is the 95% CI for the estimates.\nClinical findings\nThe comparison of the patient and OHCA characteristics between the two years is presented in Table 2. Of note, medical aetiology (94.9% vs. 89.4%; P = 0.006), home location (90.2% vs. 83.2%; P = 0.005), and unwitnessed OHCAs (53.5% vs. 45.8%; P = 0.037) were more frequent in 2020 compared with 2019; EMS arrival time was longer (15 min vs. 12 min; P &lt; 0.001) and the outcome of patients with resuscitation attempted by EMS was worse in 2020 (pre-hospital ROSC 8.6% vs. 19.8%; P &lt; 0.001 and survival at hospital discharge 5.1% vs. 9.5%; P = 0.06).\nComparison between patients' and OHCAs' characteristics in 2020 and 2019 period\nVariable	2020 (n = 490)	2019 (n = 321)	Difference (95% CI)*	P-value	 	Males, (%)	321 (65.5)	188 (58.6)	6.9 (0.1-13.8)	0.047	 	Age, years (IQR)	78 (67-84)	79 (67-86)	-1 (-3.2 to 1.2)	0.366	 	EMS arrival time, min (IQR)	15 (11-20)	12 (9-15)	3 (1.9-4.1)	&lt;0.001	 	Aetiology of arrest, n (%)	 	 Medical	465 (94.9)	287 (89.4)	5.5 (95%CI, 1.6 to 9.4)	0.006	 	 Trauma	13 (2.6)	28 (8.7)	-6.1 (-9.5 to -2.7)	&lt;0.001	 	 Drowning	0 (0)	0 (0)	-		 	 Overdose	1 (0.2)	1 (0.3)	-0.1 (-0.8 to 0.6)	0.77	 	 Electrocution	0 (0)	0 (0)	-		 	 Asphyxia (external causes)	11 (2.3)	5 (1.6)	0.7 (-1.2 to 2.6)	0.47	 	OHCA location, n (%)	 	 Home	442 (90.2)	267 (83.2)	7 (2.2-11.9)	0.005	 	 Nursing residence	21 (4.3)	23 (7.2)	-2.9 (-6.2 to 0.5)	0.09	 	 Workplace	2 (0.4)	0 (0)	-0.4 (-1 to 0.2)	0.16	 	 Street	17 (3.5)	23 (7.2)	-3.7 (-6.9 to -0.4)	0.026	 	 Public building	3 (0.6)	5 (1.5)	-0.9 (-2.5 to 0.6)	0.22	 	 Sport	0 (0)	1 (0.3)	-		 	 Other	5 (1)	2 (0.6)	0.4 (-0.8 to 1.6)	0.5	 	Witnessed status, n (%)	 	 Unwitnessed	261 (53.3)	147 (45.8)	7.5 (0.5-14.5)	0.037	 	 Bystander witnessed	171 (34.9)	143 (44.5)	-9.6 (-16.5 to -2.8)	0.006	 	 Witnessed by EMS	58 (11.8)	31 (9.7)	2.1 (-2.1 to 6.5)	0.32	 	Resuscitation attempted by EMS, n (%)	 	 Yes	314 (64.1)	222 (69.2)	-5.1 (-11.7 to 1.5)	0.13	 	 No, dead on arrival	148 (30.2)	73 (22.7)	7.5 (1.3-13.6)	0.017	 	 No, considered futile	28 (5.7)	26 (8.1)	-2.4 (-6 to 1.2)	0.2	 	Bystander CPR, n (%) 	89 (34.6)	87 (45.3)	-10.7 (-19.8 to -1.5)	0.02	 	Presenting rhythm, n (%) 	 	 Shockable	36 (11.5)	37 (16.7)	-5.2 (-11.2 to 0.8)	0.09	 	 Not shockable	278 (88.5)	185 (83.3)	5.2 (-0.8 to 11.2)	0.09	 	ACLS initiated, n (%) 	138 (43.9)	138 (62.2)	-18.3 (-26.6 to -9.8)	&lt;0.001	 	Amiodarone administered, n (%) 	17 (12.3)	16 (11.6)	0.7 (-6.9 to 8.4)	0.85	 	Adrenaline administered, n (%) 	120 (89.5)	119 (86.9)	2.6 (-0.5 to 10.4)	0.49	 	Mechanical CPR, n (%) 	9 (6.5)	23 (16.7)	-10.2 (-17.6 to -2.7)	0.008	 	Outcome, n (%) 	 	 Death in the field	253 (80.6)	156 (70.3)	10.3 (2.9-17.7)	0.007	 	 Transported with ongoing CPR	34 (10.8)	22 (9.9)	0.9 (-4.3 to 6.1)	0.73	 	 Transported with ROSC	27 (8.6)	44 (19.8)	-11.2 (-17.3 to -5.1)	&lt;0.001	 	Survived at hospital discharge, n (%) 	16 (5.1)	21 (9.5)	-4.4 (-8.9 to 0.2)	0.06	 	\nEMS, emergency medical service; OHCA, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest; CPR, cardio-pulmonary resuscitation; ACLS, advanced cardiac life support (i.e. endotracheal intubation, administration of drugs, mechanical CPR); ROSC, return of spontaneous circulation.\nDifferences are expressed as rate difference or mean difference and 95% confidence intervals.\nAmong those in whom resuscitation was attempted by the EMS and excluding those witnessed by the EMS.\nAmong those in whom resuscitation was attempted by the EMS.\nAmong those in whom ACLS was initiated.\nAmong the 490 OHCA patients in 2020, 19 had a defined diagnosis of COVID-19 and 106 presented only suspected COVID-19 symptoms (fever for at least 3 days before OHCA associated with cough and/or dyspnoea). These 125 patients (25.5% of all OHCAs in 2020) represent 74% of the increase in OHCA in 2020, equally distributed in the four provinces (30 in Lodi, 32 in Cremona, 42 in Pavia, and 21 in Mantua). Moreover, among these 125 patients, gastrointestinal symptoms (vomiting or diarrhoea for at least 3 days) were also present in 9 (7.2%). The characteristics of these patients, as well as their comparison with unsuspected/undiagnosed patients, are presented in Table 3.\nCharacteristics of patients with OHCA suspected or diagnosed for COVID-19\nVariable	COVID-19 suspected or diagnosed (n = 125)	COVID-19 not suspected or diagnosed (n = 365)	Difference (95% CI)*	P-value	 	Symptoms suspected (fever associated with cough and/or dyspnoea)	125 (100)				 	Defined diagnosis of COVID-19	19 (15.2)				 	Gastrointestinal symptoms	9 (7.2)				 	Males, n (%)	83 (66.4)	238 (65.2)	1.2 (-8.4 to 10.8)	0.81	 	Age, years (IQR)	77 (70.2-83.7)	78 (67-84)	-1 (-4 to 2)	0.52	 	EMS arrival time, min (IQR)	16 (12-22.2)	14 (11-19)	2 (0.5-3.4)	0.007	 	Aetiology of arrest, n (%)	 	 Medical	125 (100)	340 (93.1)	-		 	 Trauma	0 (0)	13 (3.6)	-		 	 Drowning	0 (0)	0 (0)	-		 	 Overdose	0 (0)	1 (0.3)	-		 	 Electrocution	0 (0)	0 (0)	-		 	 Asphyxia (external causes)	0 (0)	11 (3)	-		 	OHCA location, n (%)	 	 Home	119 (95.2)	323 (88.5)	6.7 (1.7-11.7)	0.008	 	 Nursing residence	5 (4)	16 (4.4)	-0.4 (-4.4 to 3.6)	0.85	 	 Workplace	0 (0)	2 (0.5)	-		 	 Street	1 (0.8)	16 (4.4)	-3.6 (-6.2 to -1)	0.007	 	 Public building	0 (0)	3 (0.8)	-		 	 Sport	0 (0)	0 (0)	-		 	 Other	0 (0)	5 (1.4)	-		 	Witnessed status, n (%)	 	 Unwitnessed	61 (48.8)	200 (54.8)	-6 (-16.1 to 4.1)	0.25	 	 Bystander witnessed	39 (31.2)	132 (36.2)	-5 (-14.5 to 4.5)	0.31	 	 Witnessed by EMS	25 (20)	33 (9)	11 (3.4-18.6)	0.005	 	Resuscitation attempted by EMS, n (%)	 	 Yes	88 (70.4)	226 (61.9)	8.5 (-1 to 17.9)	0.078	 	 No, dead on arrival	27 (21.6)	121 (33.1)	-11.5 (-20.2 to -2.9)	0.009	 	 No, considered futile	10 (8)	18 (4.9)	3.1 (-2.2 to 8.3)	0.25	 	Bystander CPR, n (%) 	13 (20.6)	76 (39.2)	-18.6 (-30.7 to -6.4)	0.003	 	Presenting rhythm, n (%) 	 	 Shockable	8 (9.1)	28 (12.4)	-3.3 (-10.7 to 4.1)	0.38	 	 Not shockable	80 (90.9)	198 (87.6)	3.3 (-4.1 to 10.7)	0.38	 	ACLS initiated, n (%) 	32 (36.4)	106 (46.9)	-10.5 (-22.5 to 1.4)	0.08	 	Amiodarone administered, n (%) 	3 (9.4)	14 (13.2)	-3.8 (-15.8 to 8.1)	0.53	 	Adrenaline administered, n (%) 	28 (87.5)	92 (90.2)	-2.7 (-15.5 to 10.1)	0.68	 	Mechanical CPR, n (%) 	2 (6.2)	7 (6.6)	-0.4 (-10 to 9.3)	0.94	 	Outcome, n (%) 	 	 Death in the field	70 (79.5)	183 (81)	-1.5 (-11.3 to 8.4)	0.77	 	 Transported with ongoing CPR	11 (12.5)	23 (10.2)	2.3 (-5.6 to 10.3)	0.57	 	 Transported with ROSC	7 (8)	20 (8.8)	-0.8 (-7.7 to 5.9)	0.79	 	Survived at hospital discharge, n (%) 	2 (2.3)	14 (6.2)	-3.9 (-8.3 to 0.5)	0.08	 	\nEMS, emergency medical service; OHCA, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest; CPR, cardio-pulmonary resuscitation; ACLS, advanced cardiac life support (i.e. endotracheal intubation, administration of drugs, mechanical CPR); ROSC, return of spontaneous circulation.\nDifferences are expressed as rate difference or mean difference and 95% confidence intervals.\nAmong those in whom resuscitation was attempted by the EMS and excluding those witnessed by the EMS.\nAmong those in whom resuscitation was attempted by the EMS.\nAmong those in whom ACLS was initiated.\nOut of the 27 patients transported with ROSC in 2020, a post-ROSC ECG was available and could be evaluated in 18 (67%), 6 of them with suspected or diagnosed COVID-19, with a median QTc value of 464 ms [interquartile range (IQR) 420-486]. Notably the QTc values was prolonged in 12 patients (4 of them with suspected or diagnosed COVID-19).\nFinally, the number of emergency calls to the EMS dispatch centre and the resulting callouts increased by 94.1% (55 903 in 2020 and 28 794 in 2019) and by 20.3% (26 729 in 2020 and 22 212 in 2019) in 2020 compared with the same period in 2019. Among the overall emergency calls, those with a resulting diagnosis of STEMI were 43 in 2020 and 72 in 2019, with a reduction of 40.2%.\nDiscussion\nOur study provides important insights into the impact of COVID-19 on OHCAs during the first 2 months of the epidemic from one of the first and most burdened areas worldwide. The main finding of our study is the strong and statistically significant correlation of the difference between the 2020 and 2019 OHCAs and the COVID-19 epidemic. Of note, the correlation was maintained even in the presence of a different phase of the epidemic, characterized by a more rapid rise at the beginning, towards a plateau in the latter part.\nThis aspect becomes even more evident when considering the different provinces separately, where specific shapes of the relationship were also shown when modelling using fractional polynomials. Interestingly, despite different shapes of the epidemic curve, the excess of OHCAs strictly followed the COVID-19 epidemic in all the phases of the epidemic in each province.\nFrom our perspective, this latter finding, together with the high percentage of OHCA patients with suspected or diagnosed COVID-19, strongly supports the presence of a link between the infection and such a dramatic condition as that of cardiac arrest. Furthermore, considering only the Province of Pavia, from where we have collected OHCA data since January 2015, the number of OHCAs was quite stable in the same 2-month period from 2015 to 2019, so an impressive increase in OHCA as documented in 2020 would be unexplained except for the COVID pandemic with which it was in a strong statistical relationship. Different pathophysiological reasons may support this relationship, attributable both to infection- and pandemic-related issues.\nConcerning infection-related issues, the first and more predictable reason is the occurrence of cardiac arrest due to respiratory failure caused by SARS-CoV-2, as it is the most feared life-threatening complication. There are at least two elements supporting this theory. The former is the presence of suspected symptoms or of a defined diagnosis of COVID-19 before the event in 125 patients, representing 74% of the increase in OHCAs in 2020. The latter is that hypoxia is one of the causes known to be associated to non-shockable presenting rhythm, being one of the 'five Hs and Ts'. This, along with the 3-min increase in EMS arrival time, could explain the increase in non-shockable rhythm. However, questions arise as to why these patients developed respiratory failure at home. The rapid progression toward ARDS has been reported in single case reports describing a rapid worsening to respiratory failure, even in patients who were apparently stable a few hours earlier. This could have been fatal to some patients, not leaving them sufficient time to activate the emergency system. This phenomenon is truly alarming, especially considering that the age of the patients who suffered an OHCA during the epidemic is not particularly high and is similar to that in 2019. Moreover, in some cases, the severity of the clinical situation and the risk of its rapid progression could have been undervalued, with resulting at-home care attempts favoured by the impossibility of mass hospitalization, despite extraordinary efforts of the local and national government to immediately increase ICU beds and the capacity of general wards. Risk factors associated with the progression to ARDS have been identified in some populations, but they were retrieved from critically ill patients with already confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and they may not be appropriate for discriminating patients at risk among those treated at home. However, respiratory failure cannot be the only explanation for the increase in OHCAs. It cannot be excluded that some patients experienced arrhythmic sudden cardiac death (SCD) related to this infection. A non-negligible percentage of patients affected by COVID-19 in fact experienced myocardial injury, and a series of mechanisms possibly leading to SCD have been proposed, including the effect of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, which were proposed as a treatment for COVID-19, on QT interval prolongation, with the consequent risk of ventricular arrhythmias. Additionally, the infection itself could have played a role in prolonging the QTc values, as the elevated level of some cytokines, particularly interleukin-6 (IL-6), can suppress IKr in heterologous cells and myocytes, resulting in prolonged repolarization, and IL-6 also markedly blunted the hERG/IKr channel mRNA and protein expression. Recent evidence highlighting that the QTc values might be at the upper limits or even prolonged in many patients with COVID-19, even before starting drugs potentially causing QTc prolongation, also seems to confirm this mechanism. Notably, in four out of six patients of our population with suspected or diagnosed COVID-19 and a post-ROSC ECG available, a prolonged QTc was found. However, we found that also in non-suspected or diagnosed COVID-19 patients, the percentage of those with a prolonged QTc was similar, possibly caused by myocardial ischaemia. Indeed, it has been known for &gt;40 years that a prolongation of the QT interval is associated with a major increase in the risk for ventricular arrhythmias and SCD either after a myocardial infarction or in the general population.\nIn addition, digestive symptoms (i.e. diarrhoea and vomiting) are present in a fair number of COVID-19 patients, especially in those with mild disease severity, with a delayed diagnosis and treated at home, and they were also experienced by 7% of the suspected or diagnosed COVID-19 patients in our cohort. All these conditions may favour hypokalaemia, which can drive powerful electrophysiological effects on the myocardial cells, promoting life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. Moreover, recent data suggest that pulmonary embolism (PE) could be a complication in COVID-19 patients, and this could have been another cause of OHCA in our population, consistent with a non-shockable presenting rhythm.\nLast, but not least, considering the pandemic-related issues, another possible reason for the increase of OHCAs could reside in the increased deterioration at home, with electrical or mechanical complications of time-dependent cardiovascular disease that normally would have been treated earlier. This hypothesis is fully supported by our evidence of a 40.2% reduction in 2020 of the number of patients transported for STEMI, despite an increase in the number of all emergency calls managed by the EMS dispatch centre, which is absolutely in line with other experiences from northern Italy, Spain, and the USA, and it leads to the conclusion that a considerable number of patients experienced a myocardial infarction at home, exposing themselves to an increased risk of SCD. The two possible explanations for this issue could be the fear of being infected in the hospital or the desire to not further burden the health system, both resulting in non-activation of the emergency system. This brings about the need for specific information campaigns addressed at the population explaining the importance both of the quarantine and of early activation of the EMS in the case of effective need.\nWe also observed that the characteristics of OHCAs during the outbreak are different compared with those of a normal period. We highlighted an increase in medical aetiology over other types of aetiologies, and this further reinforces the hypothesis that the increase in the incidence of OHCAs is probably related to the direct (i.e. respiratory failure at home, SCD due to SARS-CoV-2 myocardial involvement or treatment) or indirect (i.e. lack of EMS activation in the case of time-dependent pathologies) effect of the COVID-19 epidemic. Moreover, consistently with the lockdown that was adopted in Italy, there was an increase in the OHCAs that occurred at home coupled, however, with a decrease in bystander-witnessed OHCAs. This is probably the result of social distancing and, in some cases, of quarantine isolation, enforcing living in different rooms or in a different house from the rest of the family. A decrease of the bystander CPR rate was also observed, and it is probably due to the issue of the fear of infection. Furthermore, a 3-min median increase in EMS arrival time was observed, reasonably affecting the percentage of non-shockable presenting rhythm. This delay was probably due both to the very high volume of rescues managed by EMS and to the time needed to put on PPE by EMS personnel. As a matter of fact, the EMS arrival time was longer for suspected/diagnosed COVID-19 patients than for the others. All the above aspects have led to a dramatic increase of OHCAs and, regretably, of people both dead on arrival, without any attempt of resuscitation by EMS, and dead in the field after a resuscitation attempt, highlighting COVID-19 as a disease that kills at home. This may also favour an underestimation of COVID-19 lethality, since the official statistics refer only to hospitalized patients, excluding those who died at home.\nWe believe that our evidence could be very useful to other countries, in order to optimize the treatment of COVID-19 patients and organize the emergency medical response, especially considering that SARS-CoV-2 will definitely not be defeated in a few months and recurrent outbreaks are expected already in the coming months.\nOur study has some limitations. The first consists of the relatively short period of time analysed. However, although we have analysed only the first 60 days since the start of the epidemic, our results are already impressive and highlight the close relationship between the increase in OHCAs in 2020 and the COVID-19 epidemic. Moreover, in these 60 days, the epidemic curve has reached a plateau and, nevertheless, the relationship was maintained. The second relies on the impossibility of having the certainty of the causative diagnosis of cardiac arrest for each patient, as is typical for OHCA registries. However, we believe that the statistically strong correlation, supported by clinical elements such as the evidence that more than three-quarters of the 'extra' patients were highly suspected of or diagnosed with COVID-19, the reduction of 40.2% of the patients with a pre-hospital diagnosis of STEMI, and the changes in the characteristics of OHCAs, can be reasonably sufficient for confirming the direct or indirect role of COVID-19 in the observed increase in the incidence of OHCA. The third limitation could be the lack of information either about home therapy at the moment of OHCA or about the previous medical history or comorbidities of the patients. Lastly, post-ROSC ECG was available only in 18 out 27 patients who achieved ROSC. This is because either the ECG was not performed by the EMS personnel or it was recorded but not transmitted to the dispatch centre or, even if transmitted, the file was unavailable due to technical issue.\nSummarizing, the COVID-19 epidemic trend is associated with the difference between 2020 and 2019 OHCAs and is coupled with a reduction in the short-term outcome. Government and local health authorities should seriously consider our results when planning healthcare strategies to deal with the epidemic, not neglecting the pre-hospital issue of the emergency, especially considering the expected recurrent outbreaks.\nSupplementary Material\nReferences\nA novel coronavirus from patients with pneumonia in China, 2019\nCovid-19:navigating the

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui Ming, Hui Hoy and Chow Sin Lan Charity Fund Limited, Marina Man-Wai Lee, the Hong Kong Hainan Commercial Association South China Microbiology Research Fund, Sanming Project of Medicine (Shenzhen), and High Level-Hospital Program (Guangdong Health Commission).\n\n\n","id":"PMC7159286","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Jasper Fuk-Woo","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shuofeng","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kin-Hang","surname":"Kok","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kelvin Kai-Wang","surname":"To","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hin","surname":"Chu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jin","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fanfan","surname":"Xing","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jieling","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Cyril Chik-Yan","surname":"Yip","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rosana Wing-Shan","surname":"Poon","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hoi-Wah","surname":"Tsoi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Simon Kam-Fai","surname":"Lo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kwok-Hung","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Vincent Kwok-Man","surname":"Poon","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wan-Mui","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jonathan Daniel","surname":"Ip","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jian-Piao","surname":"Cai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Vincent Chi-Chung","surname":"Cheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Honglin","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christopher Kim-Ming","surname":"Hui","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kwok-Yung","surname":"Yuen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30211-7","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study","abstract":"Background\nIn December, 2019, a pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China.\n\n We aimed to further clarify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020.

The combination of eosinopenia and elevated hs-CRP yielded a sensitivity of 67·9% and specificity of 78·2% (AUC=0·730).\n\n The addition of eosinopenia alone or the combination of eosinopenia and elevated hs-CRP into the guideline-recommended diagnostic parameters for COVID-19 improved the predictive capacity with higher than zero of both net reclassification improvement (NRI) and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI).\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe combination of eosinopenia and elevated hs-CRP can effectively triage suspected COVID-19 patients from other patients attending the fever clinic with COVID-19-like initial symptoms.\n\n This finding would be particularly useful for designing triage strategies in an epidemic region having a large number of patients with COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases while limited medical resources for nucleic acid tests and radiographic examination.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7196382","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier","authors":[{"firstname":"Qilin","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiuli","surname":"Ding","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Geqing","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Heng-Gui","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fenghua","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhi","surname":"Geng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Luming","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shijun","surname":"Lei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"An","surname":"Pan","email":"panan@hust.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin","surname":"Wang","email":"lin_wang@hust.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng","surname":"Wang","email":"zhengwang@hust.edu.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1001/jamacardio.2020.0950","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Association of cardiac injury with mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1001/jamacardio.2020.1017","date":"2020-03-09","title":"Cardiovascular Implications of Fatal Outcomes of Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)","abstract":"This case series study evaluates the association of underlying cardiovascular disease and myocardial injury on fatal outcomes in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n","id":"PMC7101506","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"American Medical Association","authors":[{"firstname":"Tao","surname":"Guo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yongzhen","surname":"Fan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ming","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoyan","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tao","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hairong","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Wan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xinghuan","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhibing","surname":"Lu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30566-3","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study","abstract":"Background\nSince December, 2019, Wuhan, China, has experienced an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).\n\n Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (?18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020.

therapy (26.7%), and the fear of allergic reaction (10.7%).\n\n The refusal rate (RR) after 15th March (date of AstraZeneca-AZD1222 suspension) was more than doubled compared with the RR observed before (19.7% versus 8.6%, odds ratio [OR] 2.60, 95% CI 1.69–3.99; P &lt; 0.0001).\n\n ECOG-PS 2 was associated with higher RR compared with ECOG-PS 0-1 (OR 2.94, 95% CI 1.04–8.34; P = 0.04).\n\n No statistically significant differences in RR according to other clinical characteristics were found.\n\n\nConclusions\nOur experience represents the first worldwide report on the adherence of patients with cancer to COVID-19 vaccination and underlines how regulatory decisions and media news spreading could influence the success of the campaign.\n\n\n","id":"PMC8149194","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Vincenzo","surname":"Di

management of patients found to have multivessel disease while undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (P-PCI) for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction is uncertain.\n\n\nObjectives\nCvLPRIT (Complete versus Lesion-only Primary PCI trial) is a U.\n\nK.\n\n open-label randomized study comparing complete revascularization at index admission with treatment of the infarct-related artery (IRA) only.\n\n\nMethods\nAfter they provided verbal assent and underwent coronary angiography, 296 patients in 7 U.\n\nK.\n\n centers were randomized through an interactive voice-response program to either in-hospital complete revascularization (n = 150) or IRA-only revascularization (n = 146).\n\n Complete revascularization was performed either at the time of P-PCI or before hospital discharge.\n\n Randomization was stratified by infarct location (anterior/nonanterior) and symptom onset (?3 h or &gt;3 h).\n\n The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause death, recurrent myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure, and ischemia-driven revascularization within 12 months.\n\n\nResults\nPatient groups were well matched for baseline clinical characteristics.\n\n The primary endpoint occurred in 10.0% of the complete revascularization group versus 21.2% in the IRA-only revascularization group (hazard ratio: 0.45; 95% confidence interval: 0.24 to 0.84; p = 0.009).\n\n A trend toward benefit was seen early after complete revascularization (p = 0.055 at 30 days).\n\n Although there was no significant reduction in death or MI, a nonsignificant reduction in all primary endpoint components was seen.\n\n There was no reduction in ischemic burden on myocardial perfusion scintigraphy or in the safety endpoints of major bleeding, contrast-induced nephropathy, or stroke between the groups.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn patients presenting for P-PCI with multivessel disease, index admission complete revascularization significantly lowered the rate of the composite primary endpoint at 12 months compared with treating only the IRA.\n\n In such patients, inpatient total revascularization may be considered, but larger clinical trials are required to confirm this result and specifically address whether this strategy is associated with improved survival.\n\n (Complete Versus Lesion-only Primary PCI Pilot Study [CvLPRIT];

researchers?","abstract":"At a time of historically low National Institutes of Health funding rates and many problems with the conduct of research (unfunded mandates, disgruntled reviewers, and rampant paranoia), there is a concern that biomedical research as a profession is waning in the United States (see ”Rescuing US biomedical research from its systemic flaws” by Alberts and colleagues in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences).\n However, it is wonderful to discover something new and to tackle tough puzzles.\n If we could focus more of our effort on discussing scientific problems and doing research, then we could be more productive and perhaps happier.\n One potential solution is to focus efforts on small thematic institutes in the university structure that can provide a stimulating and supportive environment for innovation and exploration.\n With an open-lab concept, there are economies of scale that can diminish paperwork and costs, while providing greater access to state-of-the-art equipment.\n Merging multiple disciplines around a common theme can catalyze innovation, and this enables individuals to develop new concepts without giving up the credit they deserve, because it is usually clear who did the work.\n Small institutes do not solve larger systemic problems but rather enable collective efforts to address the noisome aspects of the system and foster an innovative community effort to address scientific problems.\n","id":"PMC4214771","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"The American Society for Cell

auditory perception, musical skill, and emotional responsiveness to music","abstract":"Williams syndrome (WS), a genetic, neurodevelopmental disorder, is of keen interest to music cognition researchers because of its characteristic auditory sensitivities and emotional responsiveness to music.\n However, actual musical perception and production abilities are more variable.\n We examined musicality in WS through the lens of amusia and explored how their musical perception abilities related to their auditory sensitivities, musical production skills, and emotional responsiveness to music.\n In our sample of 73 adolescents and adults with WS, 11% met criteria for amusia, which is higher than the 4% prevalence rate reported in the typically developing (TD) population.\n Amusia was not related to auditory sensitivities but was related to musical training.\n Performance on the amusia measure strongly predicted musical skill but not emotional responsiveness to music, which was better predicted by general auditory sensitivities.\n This study represents the first time amusia has been examined in a population with a known neurodevelopmental genetic disorder with a range of cognitive abilities.\n Results have implications for the relationships across different levels of auditory processing, musical skill development, and emotional responsiveness to music, as well as the understanding of gene-brain-behavior relationships in individuals with WS and TD individuals with and without amusia.\n","id":"PMC3744910","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Frontiers

solutions for implementing and managing medical registries as well as aggregate, reproduce, and access data sets from legacy formats and platforms to advanced standard formats and operating systems are crucial for both clinical healthcare and biomedical research settings.\n\n\nPurpose\nOur study describes a reproducible, highly scalable, standard framework for a device registry implementation addressing both local data quality components and global linking problems.\n\n\nMethods and Results\nWe developed a device registry framework involving the following steps: (1) Data standards definition and representation of the research workflow, (2) Development of electronic case report forms using REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture), (3) Data collection according to the clinical research workflow and, (4) Data augmentation by enriching the registry database with local electronic health records, governmental database and linked open data collections, (5) Data quality control and (6) Data dissemination through the registry Web site.\n\n Our registry adopted all applicable standardized data elements proposed by American College Cardiology / American Heart Association Clinical Data Standards, as well as variables derived from cardiac devices randomized trials and Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium.\n\n Local interoperability was performed between REDCap and data derived from Electronic Health Record system.\n\n The original data set was also augmented by incorporating the reimbursed values paid by the Brazilian government during a hospitalization for pacemaker implantation.\n\n By linking our registry to the open data collection repository Linked Clinical Trials (LinkedCT) we found 130 clinical trials which are potentially correlated with our pacemaker registry.\n\n\nConclusion\nThis study demonstrates how standard and reproducible solutions can be applied in the implementation of medical registries to constitute a re-usable framework.\n\n Such approach has the potential to facilitate data integration between healthcare and research settings, also being a useful framework to be used in other biomedical registries.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3723676","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Kátia Regina","surname":"da

development","abstract":"Rare disease registries (RDRs) are an essential tool to improve knowledge and monitor interventions for rare diseases.\n If designed appropriately, patient and disease related information captured within them can become the cornerstone for effective diagnosis and new therapies.\n Surprisingly however, registries possess a diverse range of functionality, operate in different, often-times incompatible, software environments and serve various, and sometimes incongruous, purposes.\n Given the ambitious goals of the International Rare Diseases Research Consortium (IRDiRC) by 2020 and beyond, RDRs must be designed with the agility to evolve and efficiently interoperate in an ever changing rare disease landscape, as well as to cater for rapid changes in Information Communication Technologies.\n In this paper, we contend that RDR requirements will also evolve in response to a number of factors such as changing disease definitions and diagnostic criteria, the requirement to integrate patient/disease information from advances in either biotechnology and/or phenotypying approaches, as well as the need to adapt dynamically to security and privacy concerns.\n We dispel a number of myths in RDR development, outline key criteria for robust and sustainable RDR implementation and introduce the concept of a RDR Checklist to guide future RDR development.\n","id":"PMC4015362","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

lumbar spine surgery: changing behavior through physical therapy (CBPT) study protocol","abstract":"Background\nThe United States has the highest rate of lumbar spine surgery in the world, with rates increasing over 200% since 1990. Medicare spends over $1 billion annually on lumbar spine surgery.\n\n Despite surgical advances, up to 40% of patients report chronic pain and disability following surgery.\n\n Our work has demonstrated that fear of movement is a risk factor for increased pain and disability and decreased physical function in patients following lumbar spine surgery for degenerative conditions.\n\n Cognitive-behavioral therapy and self-management treatments have the potential to address psychosocial risk factors and improve outcomes after spine surgery, but are unavailable or insufficiently adapted for postoperative care.\n\n Our research team developed a cognitive-behavioral based self-management approach to postoperative rehabilitation (Changing Behavior through Physical Therapy (CBPT)).\n\n Pilot testing of the CBPT program demonstrated greater improvement in pain, disability, physical and mental health, and physical performance compared to education.\n\n The current study compares which of two treatments provided by telephone – a CBPT Program or an Education Program about postoperative recovery - are more effective for improving patient-centered outcomes in adults following lumbar spine surgery for degenerative conditions.\n\n\nMethods/design\nA multi-center, comparative effectiveness trial will be conducted.\n\n Two hundred and sixty patients undergoing lumbar spine surgery for degenerative conditions will be recruited from two medical centers and community surgical practices.\n\n Participants will be randomly assigned to CBPT or Education at 6 weeks following surgery.\n\n Treatments consist of six weekly telephone sessions with a trained physical therapist.\n\n The primary outcome will be disability and secondary outcomes include pain, general health, and physical activity.\n\n Outcomes will be assessed preoperatively and at 6 weeks, 6 months and 12 months after surgery by an assessor masked to group allocation.\n\n\nDiscussion\nEffective rehabilitation treatments that can guide clinicians in their recommendations, and patients in their actions will have the potential to effect change in current clinical practice.\n\n\nTrial

sites, allowing for cross-site collaboration.\n\n Each site used between four and 37 individual measures and five of the sites are validating the PhenX measures through comparison with other study measures.\n\n Self-administered and computer-based administration modes are being evaluated at several sites which required changes to the original PhenX Toolkit protocols.\n\n A network-wide data use agreement was developed to facilitate data sharing and collaboration.\n\n\nResults\nPhenX Toolkit measures have been collected for more than 17,000 participants across the PhenX RISING network.\n\n The process of implementation provided information that was used to improve the PhenX Toolkit.\n\n The Toolkit was revised to allow researchers to select self- or interviewer administration when creating the data collection worksheets and ranges of specimens necessary to run biological assays has been added to the Toolkit.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe PhenX RISING network has demonstrated that the PhenX Toolkit measures can be implemented successfully in ongoing genomic studies.\n\n The next step will be to conduct gene/environment

implementation, and policies for data use.\n\n In contrast to the conventional model of centralized data contribution, warehousing, and control, we design a self-scaling registry technology for collaborative data sharing, based upon the widely adopted Integrating Biology &amp; the Bedside (i2b2) data warehousing framework and the Shared Health Research Information Network (SHRINE) peer-to-peer networking software.\n\n\nMaterials and methods\nFocusing our design around creation of a scalable solution for collaboration within multi-site disease registries, we leverage the i2b2 and SHRINE open source software to create a modular, ontology-based, federated infrastructure that provides research investigators full ownership and access to their contributed data while supporting permissioned yet robust data sharing.\n\n We accomplish these objectives via web services supporting peer-group overlays, group-aware data aggregation, and administrative functions.\n\n\nResults\nThe 56-site Childhood Arthritis &amp; Rheumatology Research Alliance (CARRA) Registry and 3-site Harvard Inflammatory Bowel Diseases Longitudinal Data Repository now utilize i2b2 self-scaling registry technology (i2b2-SSR).\n\n This platform, extensible to federation of multiple projects within and between research networks, encompasses &gt;6000 subjects at sites throughout the USA.\n\n\nDiscussion\nWe utilize the i2b2-SSR platform to minimize technical barriers to collaboration while enabling fine-grained control over data sharing.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe implementation of i2b2-SSR for the multi-site, multi-stakeholder CARRA Registry has established a digital infrastructure for community-driven research data sharing in pediatric rheumatology in the USA.\n\n We envision i2b2-SSR as a scalable, reusable solution facilitating interdisciplinary research across diseases.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3555330","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BMJ

coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile

infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus?2, which has posed a significant threat to global health.\n Although the infection is frequently asymptomatic or associated with mild symptoms, in a small proportion of patients it can produce an intense inflammatory and prothrombotic state that can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiple organ failure, and death.\n Angiotensin?converting enzyme 2, highly expressed in the respiratory system, has been identified as a functional receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus?2. Notably, angiotensin?converting enzyme 2 is also expressed in the cardiovascular system, and there are multiple cardiovascular implications of COVID?19. Cardiovascular risk factors and cardiovascular disease have been associated with severe manifestations and poor prognosis in patients with COVID?19. More important, patients with COVID?19 may have thrombotic and coagulation abnormalities, promoting a hypercoagulable state and resulting in an increased rate of thrombotic and thromboembolic

pooled evidence from available randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to provide insights on this topic.\n\n\nMethods and results\nWe searched for RCTs comparing treatment with an escalated-dose (intermediate-dose or therapeutic-dose) vs.\n\n a standard-dose prophylactic anticoagulation regimen in critically and non-critically ill COVID-19 patients requiring hospitalization and without a formal indication for anticoagulation.\n\n The primary efficacy endpoint was all-cause death, and the primary safety endpoint was major bleeding.\n\n Seven RCTs were identified, including 5154 patients followed on an average of 33 days.\n\n Compared to standard-dose prophylactic anticoagulation, escalated-dose prophylactic anticoagulation was not associated with a reduction of all-cause death [17.8% vs.\n\n 18.6%; risk ratio (RR) 0.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78–1.18] but was associated with an increase in major bleeding (2.4% vs.\n\n 1.4%; RR 1.73, 95%CI 1.15–2.60).\n\n Compared to prophylactic anticoagulation used at a standard dose, an escalated dose was associated with lower rates of venous thromboembolism (2.5% vs.\n\n 4.7%; RR 0.55, 95%CI 0.41–0.74) without a significant effect on myocardial infarction (RR 0.80, 95%CI 0.47–1.36), stroke (RR 0.94, 95%CI 0.43–2.09), or systemic arterial embolism (RR 1.20, 95%CI 0.29–4.95).\n\n There were no significant interactions in the subgroup analysis for critically and non-critically ill patients.\n\n\nConclusions\nOur findings provide comprehensive and high-quality evidence for the use of standard-dose prophylactic anticoagulation over an escalated-dose regimen as routine standard of care for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who do not have an indication for therapeutic anticoagulation, irrespective of disease severity.\n\n\nStudy registration\nThis study is registered in PROSPERO (CRD42021257203).\n\n\n","id":"PMC8499924","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Oxford

of acute (myo)pericarditis (AMP) in patients with COVID-19.\nMethods\nCase-control, retrospective review, consecutive case inclusion performed in 62 Spanish EDs.\n\n All COVID-19 patients with AMP (cases) were compared in clinical characteristics and outcomes with COVID-19 without AMP (control group A) and non-COVID patients with AMP (control group B).\n\n We estimated unadjusted standardised incidence (SI, not adjusted by population’s age/sex) of AMP in COVID-19 and non-COVID populations (per 100 000/year).\n\n\nResults\nWe identified 67 AMP in COVID-19 patients (SI=56.5, OR with respect to non-COVID patients=4.43, 95% CI=3.98 to 4.94).\n\n Remarkably, COVID-19 cases presented with chest pain less frequently than non-COVID patients and had less typical ECG changes, higher NT-proBNP (N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide), more left and right ventricular dysfunction in echocardiography and more need of inotropic/vasopressor drugs.\n\n Admission to intensive care was higher than control group A (OR=3.22, 95% CI=1.43 to 7.23), and in-hospital mortality was higher than control group B (OR=7.75, 95% CI=2.77 to 21.7).\n\n\nConclusion\nAMP is unusual as a form of COVID-19 presentation (about 1‰ cases), but SI is more than?fourfold higher than non-COVID population, and it is less symptomatic, more severe and has higher in-hospital mortality; therefore, rapid recognition, echocardiographic assessment of myopericardial inflammation/dysfunction and treatment with vasoactive drugs when needed are recommended in AMP in patients with

in clinical prediction modelling","abstract":"Clinical prediction models are used frequently in clinical practice to identify patients who are at risk of developing an adverse outcome so that preventive measures can be initiated.\n A prediction model can be developed in a number of ways; however, an appropriate variable selection strategy needs to be followed in all cases.\n Our purpose is to introduce readers to the concept of variable selection in prediction modelling, including the importance of variable selection and variable reduction strategies.\n We will discuss the various variable selection techniques that can be applied during prediction model building (backward elimination, forward selection, stepwise selection and all possible subset selection), and the stopping rule/selection criteria in variable selection (p values, Akaike information criterion, Bayesian information criterion and Mallows’ Cp statistic).\n This paper focuses on the importance of including appropriate variables, following the proper steps, and adopting the proper methods when selecting variables for prediction models.\n","id":"PMC7032893","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BMJ Publishing Group","authors":[{"firstname":"Mohammad Ziaul

bleeding after covid-19.\nDesign\nSelf-controlled case series and matched cohort study.\n\n\nSetting\nNational registries in Sweden.\n\n\nParticipants\n1?057?174 people who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 between 1 February 2020 and 25 May 2021 in Sweden, matched on age, sex, and county of residence to 4?076?342 control participants.\n\n\nMain outcomes measures\nSelf-controlled case series and conditional Poisson regression were used to determine the incidence rate ratio and risk ratio with corresponding 95% confidence intervals for a first deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or bleeding event.\n\n In the self-controlled case series, the incidence rate ratios for first time outcomes after covid-19 were determined using set time intervals and the spline model.\n\n The risk ratios for first time and all events were determined during days 1-30 after covid-19 or index date using the matched cohort study, and adjusting for potential confounders (comorbidities, cancer, surgery, long term anticoagulation treatment, previous venous thromboembolism, or previous bleeding event).\n\n\nResults\nCompared with the control period, incidence rate ratios were significantly increased 70 days after covid-19 for deep vein thrombosis, 110 days for pulmonary embolism, and 60 days for bleeding.\n\n In particular, incidence rate ratios for a first pulmonary embolism were 36.17 (95% confidence interval 31.55 to 41.47) during the first week after covid-19 and 46.40 (40.61 to 53.02) during the second week.\n\n Incidence rate ratios during days 1-30 after covid-19 were 5.90 (5.12 to 6.80) for deep vein thrombosis, 31.59 (27.99 to 35.63) for pulmonary embolism, and 2.48 (2.30 to 2.68) for bleeding.\n\n Similarly, the risk ratios during days 1-30 after covid-19 were 4.98 (4.96 to 5.01) for deep vein thrombosis, 33.05 (32.8 to 33.3) for pulmonary embolism, and 1.88 (1.71 to 2.07) for bleeding, after adjusting for the effect of potential confounders.\n\n The rate ratios were highest in patients with critical covid-19 and highest during the first pandemic wave in Sweden compared with the second and third waves.\n\n In the same period, the absolute risk among patients with covid-19 was 0.039% (401 events) for deep vein thrombosis, 0.17% (1761 events) for pulmonary embolism, and 0.101% (1002 events) for bleeding.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe findings of this study suggest that covid-19 is a risk factor for deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and bleeding.\n\n These results could impact recommendations on diagnostic and prophylactic strategies against venous thromboembolism after covid-19.\n","id":"PMC8984137","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BMJ Publishing Group

cases in Sweden.\n\n\nMethods\nThis self-controlled case series (SCCS) and matched cohort study was done in Sweden.\n\n The personal identification numbers of all patients with COVID-19 in Sweden from Feb 1 to Sept 14, 2020, were identified and cross-linked with national inpatient, outpatient, cancer, and cause of death registers.\n\n The controls were matched on age, sex, and county of residence in Sweden.\n\n International Classification of Diseases codes for acute myocardial infarction or ischaemic stroke were identified in causes of hospital admission for all patients with COVID-19 in the SCCS and all patients with COVID-19 and the matched control individuals in the matched cohort study.\n\n The SCCS method was used to calculate the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for first acute myocardial

We used a standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect platelet factor 4 (PF4)–heparin antibodies and a modified (PF4-enhanced) platelet-activation test to detect platelet-activating antibodies under various reaction conditions.\n\n Included in this testing were samples from patients who had blood samples referred for investigation of vaccine-associated thrombotic events, with 28 testing positive on a screening PF4–heparin immunoassay.\n\n\nResults\nOf the 11 original patients, 9 were women, with a median age of 36 years (range, 22 to 49).\n\n Beginning 5 to 16 days after vaccination, the patients presented with one or more thrombotic events, with the exception of 1 patient, who presented with fatal intracranial hemorrhage.\n\n Of the patients with one or more thrombotic events, 9 had cerebral venous thrombosis, 3 had splanchnic-vein thrombosis, 3 had pulmonary embolism, and 4 had other thromboses; of these patients, 6 died.\n\n Five patients had disseminated intravascular coagulation.\n\n None of the patients had received heparin before symptom onset.\n\n All 28 patients who tested positive for antibodies against PF4–heparin tested positive on the platelet-activation assay in the presence of PF4 independent of heparin.\n\n Platelet activation was inhibited by high levels of heparin, Fc receptor–blocking monoclonal antibody, and immune globulin (10 mg per milliliter).\n\n Additional studies with PF4 or PF4–heparin affinity purified antibodies in 2 patients confirmed PF4-dependent platelet activation.\n\n\nConclusions\nVaccination with ChAdOx1 nCov-19 can result in the rare development of immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia mediated by platelet-activating antibodies against PF4, which clinically mimics autoimmune heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.\n\n (Funded by the German Research Foundation.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC8095372","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical

arrays.\n\n High signal markers were genotyped in SCA cases (n?=?521) identified from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (ARIC) and the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) (combined n?=?19,611).\n\n No SNPs reached genome-wide significance (p&lt;5×10?8).\n\n SNPs at 6 loci were prioritized for follow-up primarily based on significance of p&lt;10?4 and proximity to a known gene (CSMD2, GPR37L1, LIN9, B4GALNT3, GPC5, and ZNF592).\n\n The minor allele of GPC5 (GLYPICAN 5, rs3864180) was associated with a lower risk of SCA in Oregon-SUDS, an effect that was also observed in ARIC/CHS whites (p&lt;0.05) and blacks (p&lt;0.04).\n\n In a combined Cox proportional hazards model analysis that adjusted for race, the minor allele exhibited a hazard ratio of 0.85 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.98; p&lt;0.01).\n\n\nConclusions/Significance\nA novel genetic locus for SCA, GPC5, was identified from Oregon-SUDS and successfully validated in the ARIC and CHS cohorts.\n\n Three other members of the Glypican family have been previously implicated in human disease, including cardiac conditions.\n\n The mechanism of this specific association requires further study.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2845611","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Dan

(ICDs) reduce total mortality in patients with severe left ventricular systolic function.\n\n However, only a minority of patients benefit from these devices.\n\n We designed the Prospective Observational Study of Implantable Cardioverter?Defibrillators (PROSE?ICD) to identify risk factors and enhance our understanding of the biological mechanisms that predispose to arrhythmic death in patients undergoing ICD implantation for primary prevention of sudden death.\n\n\nMethods and Results\nThis is a multicenter prospective cohort study with a target enrollment of 1200 patients.\n\n The primary end point is ICD shocks for adjudicated ventricular tachyarrhythmias.\n\n The secondary end point is total mortality.\n\n All patients undergo a comprehensive evaluation including history and physical examination, signal?averaged electrocardiograms, and blood sampling for genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses.\n\n Patients are evaluated every 6 months and after every known ICD shock for additional electrocardiographic and blood sampling.\n\n As of December 2011, a total of 1177 patients have been enrolled with more nonwhite and female patients compared to previous randomized trials.\n\n A total of 143 patients have reached the primary end point, whereas a total of 260 patients died over an average follow?up of 59 months.\n\n The PROSE?ICD study represents a real?world cohort of individuals with systolic heart failure receiving primary?prevention ICDs.\n\n\nConclusions\nExtensive electrophysiological and structural phenotyping as well as the availability of serial

Q wave and the end of the T wave as measured by electrocardiogram) were not found to be significantly associated with having an LTA.\n\n Although powered to detect such associations, we did not find common genetic variants of large effect associated with having a LTA in those of European descent.\n\n This indicates that common gene variants cannot be used at this time to guide ICD

We conclude our work with a summary table (an Excel spread sheet including all formulas) that serves as a comprehensive guidance for performing meta-analysis in different situations.\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/1471-2288-14-135) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\nBackground\nIn medical research, it is common to find that several similar trials are conducted to verify the clinical effectiveness of a certain treatment. While individual trial study could fail to show a statistically significant treatment effect, systematic reviews and meta-analysis of combined results might reveal the potential benefits of treatment. For instance, Antman et al. pointed out that systematic reviews and meta-analysis of randomized control trials would have led to earlier recognition of the benefits of thrombolytic therapy for myocardial infarction and may save a large number of patients.\nPrior to the 1990s, the traditional approach to combining results from multiple trials is to conduct narrative (unsystematic) reviews, which are mainly based on the experience and subjectivity of experts in the area. However, this approach suffers from many critical flaws. The major one is due to inconsistent criteria of different reviewers. To claim a treatment effect, different reviewers may use different thresholds, which often lead to opposite conclusions from the same study. Hence, from the mid-1980s, systematic reviews and meta-analysis have become an imperative tool in medical effectiveness measurement. Systematic reviews use specific and explicit criteria to identify and assemble related studies and usually provide a quantitative (statistic) estimate of aggregate effect over all the included studies. The methodology in systematic reviews is usually referred to as meta-analysis. With the combination of several studies and more data taken into consideration in systematic reviews, the accuracy of estimations will get improved and more precise interpretations towards the treatment effect can be achieved via meta-analysis.\nIn meta-analysis of continuous outcomes, the sample size, mean, and standard deviation are required from included studies. This, however, can be difficult because results from different studies are often presented in different and non-consistent forms. Specifically in medical research, instead of reporting the sample mean and standard deviation of the trials, some trial studies only report the median, the minimum and maximum values, and/or the first and third quartiles. Therefore, we need to estimate the sample mean and standard deviation from these quantities so that we can pool results in a consistent format. Hozo et al. were the first to address this estimation problem. They proposed a simple method for estimating the sample mean and the sample variance (or equivalently the sample standard deviation) from the median, range, and the size of the sample. Their method is now widely accepted in the literature of systematic reviews and meta-analysis. For instance, a search of Google Scholar on November 12, 2014 showed that the article of Hozo et al.'s method has been cited 722 times where 426 citations are made recently in 2013 and 2014.\nIn this paper, we will show that the estimation of the sample standard deviation in Hozo et al.'s method has some serious limitations. In particular, their estimator did not incorporate the information of the sample size and so consequently, it is always less satisfactory in practice. Inspired by this, we propose a new estimation method that will greatly improve their method. In addition, we will investigate the estimation problem under several other interesting settings where the first and third quartiles are also available for the trials.\nThroughout the paper, we define the following summary statistics:\na= the minimum value,\nq1= the first quartile,\nm= the median,\nq3= the third quartile,\nb= the maximum value,\nn= the sample size.\nThe {a,q1,m,q3,b} is often referred to as the 5-number summary. Note that the 5-number summary may not always be given in full. The three frequently encountered scenarios are:\nHozo et al.'s method only addressed the estimation of the sample mean and variance under Scenario  while Scenarios  and  are also common in systematic review and meta-analysis. In Sections 'Methods' and 'Results', we study the estimation problem under these three scenarios, respectively. Simulation studies are conducted in each scenario to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods. We conclude the paper in Section 'Discussion' with some discussions and a summary table to provide a comprehensive guidance for performing meta-analysis in different situations.\nMethods\nEstimating and Sfrom \nScenario  assumes that the median, the minimum, the maximum and the sample size are given for a clinical trial study. This is the same assumption as made in Hozo et al.'s method. To estimate the sample mean and standard deviation, we first review the Hozo et al.'s method and point out some limitations of their method in estimating the sample standard deviation. We then propose to improve their estimation by incorporating the information of the sample size.\nThroughout the paper, we let X1,X2,...,Xn be a random sample of size n from the normal distribution N(mu,sigma2), and X(1)&lt;=X(2)&lt;= &lt;=X(n) be the ordered statistics of X1,X2, ,Xn. Also for the sake of simplicity, we assume that n=4Q + 1 with Q being a positive integer. Then \nIn this section, we are interested in estimating the sample mean  and the sample standard deviation , given that a,m,b, and n of the data are known.\nHozo et al.'s method\nFor ease of notation, let M=2Q+1. Then, M=(n+1)/2. To estimate the mean value, Hozo et al. applied the following inequalities: \nAdding up all above inequalities and dividing by n, we have , where the lower and upper bounds are \nHozo et al. then estimated the sample mean by \nNote that the second term in (2) is negligible when the sample size is large. A simplified mean estimation is given as \nFor estimating the sample standard deviation, by assuming that the data are non-negative, Hozo et al. applied the following inequalities: \nWith some simple algebra and approximations on the formula (4), we have , where the lower and upper bounds are \nThen by (3) and the approximation , the sample standard deviation is estimated by , where \nWhen n is large, it results in the following well-known range rule of thumb: \nNote that the range rule of thumb (5) is independent of the sample size. It may not work well in practice, especially when n is extremely small or large. To overcome this problem, Hozo et al. proposed the following improved range rule of thumb with respect to the different size of the sample: \nwhere the formula for n&lt;=15 is derived under the equidistantly spaced data assumption, and the formula for n&gt;70 is suggested by the Chebyshev's inequality. Note also that when the data are symmetric, we have a+b 2m and so \nHozo et al. showed that the adaptive formula (6) performs better than the original formula (5) in most settings.\nImproved estimation of S\nWe think, however, that the adaptive formula (6) may still be less accurate for practical use. First, the threshold values 15 and 70 are suggested somewhat arbitrarily. Second, given the normal data N(mu,sigma2) with sigma&gt;0 being a finite value, we know that sigma (b-a)/6   as n  . This contradicts to the assumption that sigma is a finite value. Third, the non-negative data assumption in Hozo et al.'s method is also quite restrictive.\nIn this section, we propose a new estimator to further improve (6) and, in addition, we remove the non-negative assumption on the data. Let Z1,...,Zn be independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables from the standard normal distribution N(0,1), and Z(1)&lt;= &lt;=Z(n) be the ordered statistics of Z1,...,Zn. Then Xi=mu+sigmaZi and X(i)=mu+sigmaZ(i) for i=1,...,n. In particular, we have a=mu+sigmaZ(1) and b=mu+sigmaZ(n). Since E(Z(1)) = -E(Z(n)), we have E(b-a)=2sigmaE(Z(n)). Hence, by letting xi(n)=2E(Z(n)), we choose the following estimation for the sample standard deviation: \nNote that xi(n) plays an important role in the sample standard deviation estimation. If we let xi(n) 4, then (7) reduces to the original rule of thumb in (5). If we let  for n&lt;=15, 4 for 15&lt;n&lt;=70, or 6 for n&gt;70, then (7) reduces to the improved rule of thumb (6).\nNext, we present a method to approximate xi(n) and establish an adaptive rule of thumb for standard deviation estimation. By David and Nagaraja's method, the expected value of Z(n) is \n\nValues of\nxi\n(\nn\n) in the formula (\n7\n) and the formula (\n12\n) for\nn\n&lt;=50\n\nn	xi	 	(	 	n	 	)	n	xi	 	(	 	n	 	)	n	xi	 	(	 	n	 	)	n	xi	 	(	 	n	 	)	n	xi	 	(	 	n	 	)	 	1	0	11	3.173	21	3.778	31	4.113	41	4.341	 	2	1.128	12	3.259	22	3.819	32	4.139	42	4.361	 	3	1.693	13	3.336	23	3.858	33	4.165	43	4.379	 	4	2.059	14	3.407	24	3.895	34	4.189	44	4.398	 	5	2.326	15	3.472	25	3.931	35	4.213	45	4.415	 	6	2.534	16	3.532	26	3.964	36	4.236	46	4.433	 	7	2.704	17	3.588	27	3.997	37	4.259	47	4.450	 	8	2.847	18	3.640	28	4.027	38	4.280	48	4.466	 	9	2.970	19	3.689	29	4.057	39	4.301	49	4.482	 	10	3.078	20	3.735	30	4.086	40	4.322	50	4.498	 	\nwhere  is the probability density function and  is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution. For ease of reference, we have computed the values of xi(n) by numerical integration using the computer in Table 1 for n up to 50. From Table 1, it is evident that the adaptive formula (6) in Hozo et al.'s method is less accurate and also less flexible.\nWhen n is large (say n&gt;50), we can apply Blom's method to approximate E(Z(n)). Specifically, Blom suggested the following approximation for the expected values of the order statistics: \nwhere Phi-1(z) is the inverse function of Phi(z), or equivalently, the upper zth percentile of the standard normal distribution. Blom observed that the value of alpha increases as n increases, with the lowest value being 0.330 for n=2. Overall, Blom suggested alpha=0.375 as a compromise value for practical use. Further discussion on the choice of alpha can be seen, for example, in and. Finally, by (7) and (8) with r=n and alpha=0.375, we estimate the sample standard deviation by \nIn the statistical software R, the upper zth percentile Phi-1(z) can be computed by the command &quot;qnorm(z)&quot;.\nEstimating and Sfrom \nScenario  assumes that the first quartile, q1, and the third quartile, q3, are also available in addition to . In this setting, Bland's method extended Hozo et al.'s results by incorporating the additional information of the interquartile range (IQR). He further claimed that the new estimators for the sample mean and standard deviation are superior to those in Hozo et al.'s method. In this section, we first review the Bland's method and point out some limitations of this method. We then, accordingly, propose to improve this method by incorporating the size of a sample.\nBland's method\nNoting that n=4Q+1, we have Q=(n-1)/4. To estimate the sample mean, Bland's method considered the following inequalities: \nAdding up all above inequalities and dividing by n, it results in , where the lower and upper bounds are \nBland then estimated the sample mean by (LB2+UB2)/2. When the sample size is large, by ignoring the negligible second terms in LB2 and UB2, a simplified mean estimation is given as \nFor the sample standard deviation, Bland considered some similar inequalities as in (4). Then with some simple algebra and approximation, it results in , where the lower and upper bounds are \nNext, by the approximation , \nBland's method then took the square root  to estimate the sample standard deviation. Note that the estimator (11) is independent of the sample size n. Hence, it may not be sufficient for general use, especially when n is small or large. In the next section, we propose an improved estimation for the sample standard deviation by incorporating the additional information of the sample size.\nImproved estimation of S\nRecall that the range b-a was used to estimate the sample standard deviation in Scenario . Now for Scenario , since the IQR q3-q1 is also known, another approach is to estimate the sample standard deviation by (q3-q1)/eta(n), where eta(n) is a function of n. Taking both methods into account, we propose the following combined estimator for the sample standard deviation: \nFollowing Section 'Improved estimation of S', we have xi(n)=2E(Z(n)). Now we look for an expression for eta(n) so that (q3-q1)/eta(n) also provides a good estimate of S. By (1), we have q1=mu+sigmaZ(Q+1) and q3=mu+sigmaZ(3Q+1). Then, q3-q1=sigma(Z(3Q+1)-Z(Q+1)). Further, by noting that E(Z(Q+1))=-E(Z(3Q+1)), we have E(q3-q1)=2sigmaE(Z(3Q+1)). This suggests that \nIn what follows, we propose a method to compute the value of eta(n). By, the expected value of Z(3Q+1) is \n\nValues of\neta\n(\nn\n) in the formula (\n12\n) and the formula (\n15\n) for\nQ\n&lt;=50, where\nn\n=4\nQ\n+1\n\nQ	eta	 	(	 	n	 	)	Q	eta	 	(	 	n	 	)	Q	eta	 	(	 	n	 	)	Q	eta	 	(	 	n	 	)	Q	eta	 	(	 	n	 	)	 	1	0.990	11	1.307	21	1.327	31	1.334	41	1.338	 	2	1.144	12	1.311	22	1.328	32	1.334	42	1.338	 	3	1.206	13	1.313	23	1.329	33	1.335	43	1.338	 	4	1.239	14	1.316	24	1.330	34	1.335	44	1.338	 	5	1.260	15	1.318	25	1.330	35	1.336	45	1.339	 	6	1.274	16	1.320	26	1.331	36	1.336	46	1.339	 	7	1.284	17	1.322	27	1.332	37	1.336	47	1.339	 	8	1.292	18	1.323	28	1.332	38	1.337	48	1.339	 	9	1.298	19	1.324	29	1.333	39	1.337	49	1.339	 	10	1.303	20	1.326	30	1.333	40	1.337	50	1.340	 	\nIn Table 2, we provide the numerical values of eta(n)=2E(Z(3Q+1)) for Q&lt;=50 using the statistical software R. When n is large, we suggest to apply the formula (8) to approximate eta(n). Specifically, noting that Q=(n-1)/4, we have eta(n) 2Phi-1((0.75n-0.125)/(n+0.25)) for r=3Q+1 with alpha=0.375. Then consequently, for the scenario  we estimate the sample standard deviation by \nWe note that the formula (13) is more concise than the formula (11). The numerical comparison between the two formulas will be given in the section of simulation study.\nEstimating and Sfrom \nScenario  is an alternative way to report the study other than Scenarios  and . It reports the first and third quartiles instead of the minimum and maximum values. One main reason to report  is because the IQR is usually less sensitive to outliers compared to the range. For the new scenario, we note that Hozo et al.'s method and Bland's method will no longer be applicable. Particularly, if their ideas are followed, we have the following inequalities: \nwhere the first Q inequalities are unbounded for the lower limit, and the last Q inequalities are unbounded for the upper limit. Now adding up all above inequalities and dividing by n, we have . This shows that the approaches based on the inequalities do not apply to Scenario .\nIn contrast, the following procedure is commonly adopted in the recent literature including: &quot;If the study provided medians and IQR, we imputed the means and standard deviations as described by Hozo et al. []. We calculated the lower and upper ends of the range by multiplying the difference between the median and upper and lower ends of the IQR by 2 and adding or subtracting the product from the median, respectively&quot;. This procedure, however, performs very poorly in our simulations (not shown).\nA quantile method for estimating and S\nIn this section, we propose a quantile method for estimating the sample mean and the sample standard deviation, respectively. In detail, we first revisit the estimation method in Scenario . By (10), we have \nNow for Scenario , a and b are not given. Hence, a reasonable solution is to remove a and b from the estimation and keep the second term. By doing so, we have the estimation form as , where C is a constant. Finally, noting that E(q1+m+q3)=3mu+sigmaE(Z(Q+1)+Z2Q+1+Z(3Q+1))=3mu, we let C=3 and define the estimator of the sample mean as follows: \nFor the sample standard deviation, following the idea in constructing (12) we propose the following estimation: \nwhere eta(n)=2E(Z(3Q+1)). As mentioned above that E(q3-q1)=2sigmaE(Z(3Q+1))=sigmaeta(n), therefore, the estimator (15) provides a good estimate for the sample standard deviation. The numerical values of eta(n) are given in Table 2 for Q&lt;=50. When n is large, by the approximation E(Z(3Q+1)) Phi-1((0.75n-0.125)/(n+0.25)), we can also estimate the sample standard deviation by \nA similar estimator for estimating the standard deviation from IQR is provided in the Cochrane Handbook, which is defined as \nNote that the estimator (17) is also independent of the sample size n and thus may not be sufficient for general use. As we can see from Table 2, the value of eta(n) in the formula (15) converges to about 1.35 when n is large. Note also that the denominator in formula (16) converges to 2*Phi-1(0.75) which is 1.34898 as n tends to infinity. When the sample size is small, our method will provide more accurate estimates than the formula (17) for the standard deviation estimation.\nResults\nSimulation study for \nIn this section, we conduct simulation studies to compare the performance of Hozo et al.'s method and our new method for estimating the sample standard deviation. Following Hozo et al.'s settings, we consider five different distributions: the normal distribution with mean mu=50 and standard deviation sigma=17, the log-normal distribution with location parameter mu=4 and scale parameter sigma=0.3, the beta distribution with shape parameters alpha=9 and beta=4, the exponential distribution with rate parameter lambda=10, and the Weibull distribution with shape parameter k=2 and scale parameter lambda=35. The graph of each of these distributions with the specified parameters is provided in Additional file 1. In each simulation, we first randomly sample n observations and compute the true sample standard deviation using the whole sample. We then use the median, the minimum and maximum values of the sample to estimate the sample standard deviation by the formulas (6) and (9), respectively. To assess the accuracy of the two estimates, we define the relative error of each method as\n\nRelative errors of the sample standard deviation estimation for normal data, where the red lines with solid circles represent Hozo et al.'s method, and the green lines with empty circles represent the new method.\n\n\nRelative errors of the sample standard deviation estimation for non-normal data (log-normal, beta, exponential and Weibull), where the red lines with solid circles represent Hozo et al.'s method, and the green lines with empty circles represent the new method.\n\nWith 1000 simulations, we report the average relative errors in Figure 1 for the normal distribution with the sample size ranging from 5 to 1001, and in Figure 2 for the four non-normal distributions with the sample size ranging from 5 to 101. For normal data which are most commonly assumed in meta-analysis, our new method provides a nearly unbiased estimate of the true sample standard deviation. Whereas for Hozo et al.'s method, we do observe that the best cutoff value is about n=15 for switching between the estimates  and (b-a)/4, and is about n=70 for switching between (b-a)/4 and (b-a)/6. However, its overall performance is not satisfactory by noting that the estimate always fluctuates from -20% to 20% of the true sample standard deviation. In addition, we note that xi(27) 4 from Table 1 and xi(n) 6 when Phi-1((n-0.375)/(n+0.25))=3, that is, n=(0.375+0.25*Phi(3))/(1-Phi(3)) 463. This coincides with the simulation results in Figure 1 where the method (b-a)/4 crosses the x-axis between n=20 and n=30, and the method (b-a)/6 crosses the x-axis between n=400 and n=500.\nFrom Figure 2 with the skewed data, our proposed method (9) makes a slightly biased estimate with the relative errors about 5% of the true sample standard deviation. Nevertheless, it is still obvious that the new method is much better compared to Hozo et al.'s method. We also note that, for the beta and Weibull distributions, the best cutoff values of n should be larger than 70 for switching between (b-a)/4 and (b-a)/6. This again coincides with Table one in Hozo et al. where the suggested cutoff value is n=100 for Beta and n=110 for Weibull.\nSimulation study for \nIn this section, we evaluate the performance of the proposed method (13) and compare it to Bland's method (11). Following Bland's settings, we consider (i) the normal distribution with mean mu=5 and standard deviation sigma=1, and (ii) the log-normal distribution with location parameter mu=5 and scale parameter sigma=0.25, 0.5, and 1, respectively. For simplicity, we consider the sample size being n=4Q+1, where Q takes values from 1 to 50. As in Section 'Simulation study for \n', we assess the accuracy of the two estimates by the relative error defined in (18).\n\nRelative errors of the sample standard deviation estimation for normal data and log-normal data, where the red lines with solid circles represent Bland's method, and the green lines with empty circles represent the new method.\n\nIn each simulation, we draw a total of n observations randomly from the given distribution and compute the true sample standard deviation of the sample. We then use and only use the minimum value, the first quartile, the median, the third quartile, and the maximum value to estimate the sample standard deviation by the formulas (11) and (13), respectively. With 1000 simulations, we report the average relative errors in Figure 3 for the four specified distributions. From Figure 3, we observe that the new method provides a nearly unbiased estimate of the true sample standard deviation. Even for the very highly skewed log-normal data with sigma=1, the relative error of the new method is also less than 10% for most sample sizes. On the contrary, Bland's method is less satisfactory. As reported in, the formula (11) only works for a small range of sample sizes (In our simulations, the range is about from 20 to 40). When the sample size gets larger or the distribution is highly skewed, the sample standard deviations will be highly overestimated. Additionally, we note that the sample standard deviations will be seriously underestimated if n is very small. Overall, it is evident that the new method is better than Bland's method in most settings.\nSimulation study for \nIn the third simulation study, we conduct a comparison study that not only assesses the accuracy of the proposed method under Scenario , but also addresses a more realistic question in meta-analysis, &quot;For a clinical trial study, which summary statistics should be preferred to report,,  or ? and why?&quot;\nFor the sample mean estimation, we consider the formulas (3), (10), and (14) under three different scenarios, respectively. The accuracy of the mean estimation is also assessed by the relative error, which is defined in the same way as that for the sample standard deviation estimation. Similarly, for the sample standard deviation estimation, we consider the formulas (9), (13), and (15) under three different scenarios, respectively. The distributions we considered are the same as in Section 'Simulation study for \n', i.e., the normal, log-normal, beta, exponential and Weibull distributions with the same parameters as those in previous two simulation studies.\n\nRelative errors of the sample mean and standard deviation estimations for normal data, where the black solid circles represent the method under scenario\n\n, the red solid triangles represent the method under scenario\n\n, and the green empty circles represent the method under scenario\n\n.\n\n\nRelative errors of the sample mean estimation for non-normal data (log-normal, beta, exponential and Weibull), where the black lines with solid circles represent the method under scenario\n\n, the red lines with solid triangles represent the method under scenario\n\n, and the green lines with empty circles represent the method under scenario\n\n.\n\n\nRelative errors of the sample standard deviation estimation for non-normal data (log-normal, beta, exponential and Weibull), where the black lines with solid circles represent the method under scenario\n\n, the red lines with solid triangles represent the method under scenario\n\n, and the green lines with empty circles represent the method under scenario\n\n.\n\nIn each simulation, we first draw a random sample of size n from each distribution. The true sample mean and the true sample standard deviation are computed using the whole sample. The summary statistics are also computed and categorized into Scenarios ,  and . We then use the aforementioned formulas to estimate the sample mean and standard deviation, respectively. The sample sizes are n=4Q+1, where Q takes values from 1 to 50. With 1000 simulations, we report the average relative errors in Figure 4 for both  and S with the normal distribution, in Figure 5 for the sample mean estimation with the non-normal distributions, and in Figure 6 for the sample standard deviation estimation with the non-normal distributions.\nFor normal data which meta-analysis would commonly assume, all three methods provide a nearly unbiased estimate of the true sample mean. The relative errors in the sample standard deviation estimation are also very small in most settings (within 1% in general). Among the three methods, however, we recommend to estimate  and S using the summary statistics in Scenario . One main reason is because the first and third quartiles are usually less sensitive to outliers compared to the minimum and maximum values. Consequently,  produces a more stable estimation than , and also  that is partially affected by the minimum and maximum values.\nFor non-normal data from Figure 5, we note that the mean estimation from  is always better than that from . That is, if the additional information in the first and third quartiles is available, we should always use such information. On the other hand, the estimation from  may not be consistently better than that from  even though  contains the additional information of minimum and maximum values. The reason is that this additional information may contain extreme values which may not be fully reliable and thus lead to worse estimation. Therefore, we need to be cautious when making the choice between  and . It is also noteworthy that (i) the mean estimation from  is not sensitive to the sample size, and (ii)  and  always lead to opposite estimations (one underestimates and the other overestimates the true value). While from Figure 6, we observe that (i) the standard deviation estimation from  is quite sensitive to the skewness of the data, (ii)  and  would also lead to the opposite estimations except for very small sample sizes, and (iii)  turns out to be a good compromise for estimating the sample standard deviation. Taking both into account, we recommend to report Scenario  in clinical trial studies. However, if we do not have all information in the 5-number summary and have to make a decision between  and , we recommend  for small sample sizes (say n&lt;=30), and  for large sample sizes.\nDiscussion\n\nSummary table for estimating\n\nand\nS\nunder different scenarios\n\n	Scenario	 		Scenario	 		Scenario	 		 	Hozo et al.

However, sometimes, the reported results may only include the sample size, median, range and/or IQR. To combine these results in meta-analysis, we need to estimate the sample mean and standard deviation from them. In this paper, we first show the limitations of the existing works and then propose some new estimation methods. Here we summarize all discussed and proposed estimators under different scenarios in Table 3.\nWe note that the proposed methods are established under the assumption that the data are normally distributed. In meta-analysis, however, the medians and quartiles are often reported when data do not follow a normal distribution. A natural question arises: &quot;To which extent it makes sense to apply methods that are based on a normal distribution assumption?&quot; In practice, if the entire sample or a large part of the sample is known, standard methods in statistics can be applied to estimate the skewness or even the density of the population. For the current study, however, the information provided is very limited, say for example, only a, m, b and n are given in Scenario 1. Under such situations, it may not be feasible to obtain a reliable estimate for the skewness unless we specify the underlying distribution for the population. Note that the underlying distribution is unlikely to be known in practice. Instead, if we arbitrarily choose a distribution (more likely to be misspecified), then the estimates from the wrong model can be even worse than that from the normal distribution assumption. As a compromise, we expect that the proposed formulas under the normal distribution assumption are among the best we can achieve.\nSecondly, we note that even if the means and standard deviations can be satisfyingly estimated from the proposed formulas, it still remains a question to which extent it makes sense to use them in a meta-analysis, if the underlying distribution is very asymmetric and one must assume that they don't represent location and dispersion adequately. Overall, this is a very practical yet challenging question and may warrant more research. In our future research, we propose to develop some test statistics (likelihood ratio test, score test, etc) for pre-testing the hypothesis that the distribution is symmetric (or normal) under the scenarios we considered in this article. The result of the pre-test will then suggest us whether or not we should still include the (very) asymmetric data in the meta-analysis. Other proposals that address this issue will also be considered in our future study.\nFinally, to promote the usability, we have provided an Excel spread sheet to include all formulas in Table 3 in Additional file 2. Specifically, in the Excel spread sheet, our proposed methods for estimating the sample mean and standard deviation can be applied by simply inputting the sample size, the median, the minimum and maximum values, and/or the first and third quartiles for the appropriate scenario. Furthermore, for ease of comparison, we have also included Hozo et al.'s method and Bland's method in the Excel spread sheet.\nConclusions\nIn this paper, we discuss different approximation methods in the estimation of the sample mean and standard deviation and propose some new estimation methods to improve the existing literature. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate that the proposed methods greatly improve the existing methods and enrich the literature. Specifically, we point out that the widely accepted estimator of standard deviation proposed by Hozo et al. has some serious limitations and is always less satisfactory in practice because the estimator does not fully incorporate the sample size. As we explained in Section 'Estimating  and S from  ', using (b-a)/6 for n&gt;70 in Hozo et al.'s adaptive estimation is untenable because the range b-a tends to be infinity as n approaches infinity if the distribution is not bounded, such as the normal and log-normal distributions. Our estimator replaces the adaptively selected thresholds ( with a unified quantity 2Phi-1((n-0.375)/(n+0.25)), which can be quickly computed and obviously is more stable and adaptive. In addition, our method removes the non-negative data assumption in Hozo et al.'s method and so is more applicable in practice.\nBland's method extended Hozo et al.'s method by using the additional information in the IQR. Since extra information is included, it is expected that Bland's estimators are superior to those in Hozo et al.'s method. However, the sample size is still not considered in Bland's method for the sample standard deviation, which again limits its capability in real-world cases. Our simulation studies show that Bland's estimator significantly overestimates the sample standard deviation when the sample size is large while seriously underestimating it when the sample size is small. Again, we incorporate the information of the sample size in the estimation of standard deviation via two unified quantities, 4Phi-1((n-0.375)/(n+0.25)) and 4Phi-1((0.75n-0.125)/(n+0.25)). With some extra but trivial computing costs, our method makes significant improvement over Bland's method when the IQR is available.\nMoreover, we pay special attention to an overlooked scenario where the minimum and maximum values are not available. We show that the methodology following the ideas in Hozo et al.'s method and Bland's method will lead to unbounded estimators and is not feasible. On the contrary, we extend the ideas of our proposed methods in the other two scenarios and again construct a simple but still valid estimator. After that, we take a step forward to compare the estimators of the sample mean and standard deviation under all three scenarios. For simplicity, we have only considered three most commonly used scenarios, including ,  and , in the current article. Our method, however, can be readily generalized to other scenarios, e.g., when only {a,q1,q3,b;n} are known or when additional quantile information is given.\nElectronic supplementary material\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nTT, XW, and JL conceived and designed the methods.

From March 1 to April 25, 2020, New York City, New York (NYC), reported 17 118 COVID-19-related deaths.

The NYC 911 EMS system serves more than 8.4 million people.\nExposures\nThe COVID-19 pandemic.\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nCharacteristics associated with out-of-hospital arrests and the outcomes of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests.\nResults\nA total of 5325 patients were included in the main analysis (2935 men [56.2%]; mean [SD] age, 71 [18] years), 3989 in the COVID-19 period and 1336 in the comparison period. The incidence of nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrests in those who underwent EMS resuscitation in 2020 was 3 times the incidence in 2019 (47.5/100 000 vs 15.9/100 000). Patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest during 2020 were older (mean [SD] age, 72 [18] vs 68 [19] years), less likely to be white (611 of 2992 [20.4%] vs 382 of 1161 [32.9%]), and more likely to have hypertension (2134 of 3989 [53.5%] vs 611 of 1336 [45.7%]), diabetes (1424 of 3989 [35.7%] vs 348 of 1336 [26.0%]), and physical limitations (2259 of 3989 [56.6%] vs 634 of 1336 [47.5%]). Compared with 2019, the odds of asystole increased in the COVID-19 period (odds ratio [OR], 3.50; 95% CI, 2.53-4.84; P &lt; .001), as did the odds of pulseless electrical activity (OR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.31-3.02; P = .001). Compared with 2019, the COVID-19 period had substantial reductions in return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) (727 of 3989 patients [18.2%] vs 463 of 1336 patients [34.7%], P &lt; .001) and sustained ROSC (423 of 3989 patients [10.6%] vs 337 of 1336 patients [25.2%], P &lt; .001), with fatality rates exceeding 90%. These associations remained statistically significant after adjustment for potential confounders (OR for ROSC, 0.59 [95% CI, 0.50-0.70; P &lt; .001]; OR for sustained ROSC, 0.53 [95% CI, 0.43-0.64; P &lt; .001]).\nConclusions and Relevance\nIn this population-based, cross-sectional study, out-of-hospital cardiac arrests and deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic significantly increased compared with the same period the previous year and were associated with older age, nonwhite race/ethnicity, hypertension, diabetes, physical limitations, and nonshockable presenting rhythms. Identifying patients with the greatest risk for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and death during the COVID-19 pandemic should allow for early, targeted interventions in the outpatient setting that could lead to reductions in out-of-hospital deaths.\nIntroduction\nOn March 1, 2020, the first case of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was diagnosed in New York City, New York (NYC); by April 25, 2020, 17 118 confirmed and probable deaths due to COVID-19 had already occurred. On April 6, 2020, NYC out-of-hospital cardiac arrests peaked at 305 cases, an increase of almost 10-fold compared with April 6, 2019. In Northern Italy, during the COVID-19 pandemic, out-of-hospital cardiac arrests increased by 58% compared with the same time period in 2019 and were associated with lower rates of sustained return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Infectious viral epidemics causing severe respiratory infections have long been associated with an increased risk of death. For the COVID-19 pandemic, factors independently associated with in-hospital deaths included being older than 65 years, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\nTo date, factors associated with out-of-hospital cardiac arrests and successful resuscitation during the COVID-19 pandemic have not been defined. Using data from the NYC 911 emergency medical services (EMS) system, our study compared patients with nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest who received resuscitation during the COVID-19 period and their outcomes with patients and outcomes during the same period in 2019. Our goal was to identify COVID-19-associated changes in frequency, risk factors, presenting cardiac rhythm, and out-of-hospital death despite EMS resuscitation.\nMethods\nThis study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline. The institutional review board of the Montefiore Medical Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York, approved this study and, owing to minimal risk to the participants (ie, no effect on their rights and welfare), waived the need for informed consent.\nData Sources\nThe NYC 911 EMS system is the largest in the United States, serving a population of more than 8.4 million and responding to more than 1.5 million medical calls annually. This 3-tiered system consists of firefighter-certified first responders, emergency medical technician basic life support units, and paramedic advanced life support (ALS) units. In the NYC 911 system, cardiac arrests receive the highest response priority and all 3 units (firefighter-certified first responders, basic life support units, and ALS units) are immediately dispatched. Both firefighter-certified first responders and basic life support units are certified in basic cardiac life support and carry automated external defibrillators. Paramedic ALS units can obtain and interpret 12-lead electrocardiograms and are certified in advanced cardiac life support, including advanced airway management and administering cardiac resuscitation medications. Out-of-hospital cardiac arrests are managed by EMS responders using regional prehospital protocols modeled after the American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care.\nData on out-of-hospital cardiac arrests are collected and managed by the Fire Department of NYC Online Medical Control. For cases in which EMS resuscitation is performed, a postresuscitation telephone interview of paramedics and emergency medical technicians is conducted by Online Medical Control staff. The questionnaire collects data in the Utstein style on age, sex, race/ethnicity, preexisting comorbidities, bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), presenting rhythm, and advanced cardiac life support interventions (airway management and medications). The questionnaire was validated in prior cardiac arrest research within our system. Interviews are supplemented with information from electronic prehospital patient care reports completed by EMS responders. Final call-type of cardiac arrest, response time, and ALS first on-scene were obtained from the Fire Department of NYC's 911 computer automated dispatch system. All data are maintained in a secure data warehouse.\nStudy Design\nThis population-based, cross-sectional study included patients 18 years or older with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest who received EMS resuscitation during the COVID-19 period (March 1 to April 25, 2020) or the comparison period (March 1 to April 25, 2019) in NYC. The COVID-19 period was chosen to begin March 1, 2020, the date the first patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 in NYC, and to conclude on April 25, 2020, when EMS call volume approached its pre-COVID-19 baseline. The comparison period was chosen to mirror the COVID-19 dates during the previous year. Patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrests were excluded if they did not undergo prehospital CPR owing to obvious signs of death or had a valid do-not-resuscitate order present at the time of arrest (n = 3601). The COVID-19 and the 2019 periods had similar proportions of patients dead on arrival (2355 [35.1%] vs 831 [36.1%], respectively) and patients with a do-not-resuscitate order (323 [4.8%] vs 92 [4.0%], respectively). The number of traumatic arrests were similar in the 2 periods (42 vs 43, respectively). Our final population with confirmed, nontraumatic cardiac arrest resuscitations accounted for 60% of total confirmed cardiac arrests during the study period.\nData Analysis\nFirst, we examined characteristics (demographic and other) of individuals with confirmed, nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrests who underwent resuscitation during the 2 study periods. The assumption was that excess cases of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests in the COVID-19 period were likely associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, either directly or indirectly. Excess cases of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest resuscitations were calculated by taking the daily difference between the number of calls in 2020 and 2019. The cumulative percentage of EMS calls for fever, cough, dyspnea, and viral-like symptoms consistent with COVID-19 and the cumulative percentage of excess out-of-hospital cardiac arrest resuscitations were calculated, and the temporal relationship graphed. Second, we compared the association of COVID-19 with out-of-hospital ROSC and ROSC that was sustained until emergency department arrival (hereinafter referred to as sustained ROSC), adjusted for known covariates of ROSC and sustained ROSC. These covariates included age (in 10-year increments), race/ethnicity, sex, medical history, EMS response time, bystander CPR, ALS first on-scene, ALS interventions, and presenting rhythm. For the models, first-unit response time was recoded from a continuous time variable to a binary variable of less than 6 minutes (yes or no). A response time of less than 6 minutes has been shown in multiple studies and national registries to provide the most benefit to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest outcomes. Last, presenting rhythm was only captured for cases in which ALS personnel were the first arriving units, because basic life support units or firefighter-certified first responders cannot confirm presenting rhythm when first on the scene. Because this reduced the sample available for our multivariate models, the variable was recoded to include an unclassified category to encompass cases in which presenting rhythm was missing.\nStatistical Analysis\nUnadjusted outcomes were compared using descriptive statistics. Categorical data were compared using Pearson chi2, whereas continuous data were compared using 2-tailed t tests or medians and interquartile ranges. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify characteristics of patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in the COVID-19 period as well as to assess the association of the COVID-19 period with ROSC and sustained ROSC, controlling for the above covariates. A 2-sided P &lt; .05 was considered statistically significant for both unadjusted and adjusted analyses.\nTwo sensitivity analyses using these same outcomes were conducted. The first compared the peak 2-week period of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests during the COVID-19 period (March 29 to April 11, 2020) with the same 2-week period in 2019. The second compared the peak 2-week COVID-19 period with that of the 2 weeks just before (March 16-28, 2020) and after (April 12-25, 2020) that peak. Analyses were conducted in SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc).\nResults\nA total of 5325 patients were included in the main analysis (2935 men [56.2%] and 2292 women [43.9%]; mean [SD] age, 71 [18] years). Compared with 2019, 2020 had an excess of 2653 patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest who underwent EMS resuscitation (3989 in 2020 vs 1336 in 2019, P &lt; .001), an incidence rate triple that of 2019 (47.5/100 000 vs 15.9/100 000). No time lag was observed between the proportion of daily NYC 911 EMS calls for fever, cough, dyspnea, and viral-like symptoms consistent with COVID-19 and excess out-of-hospital cardiac arrest resuscitations, defined as the difference between 2020 and 2019 counts each day (Figure, A). Figure, B shows the number of resuscitations in the population, as described herein, by period.\nNew York City Out-of-Hospital Nontraumatic Cardiac Arrest Resuscitations, March 1 through April 25, 2020\nA, Temporal association between the cumulative percentage of emergency medical services (EMS) calls for fever, cough, dyspnea, and viral-like symptoms consistent with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the number of excess out-of-hospital nontraumatic cardiac arrest resuscitations occurring in New York City in 2020. Excess cases were defined as the daily difference between the number of 2020 and 2019 cases; days with a negative difference were recoded as 0 for graphic presentation. B, The number of daily out-of-hospital nontraumatic cardiac arrest resuscitations.\nTable 1 displays the characteristics of patients with out-of-hospital nontraumatic cardiac arrests who underwent EMS resuscitation during each period. The patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in 2020 were older (mean [SD] age, 72 [18] vs 68 [19] years); less likely to be white (611 of 2992 [20.4%] vs 382 of 1161 [32.9%]); and more likely to have hypertension (2134 of 3989 [53.5%] vs 611 of 1336 [45.7%]), diabetes (1424 of 3989 [35.7%] vs 348 of 1336 [26.0%]), and physical limitations (2259 of 3989 [56.6%] vs 634 of 1336 [47.5%]). Alternately, 2020 patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest did not have higher proportions of prior cardiac disease, asthma/COPD, cerebrovascular accidents, or cancer. The proportions of bystander-witnessed arrests and bystander CPR were similar in both periods.\nPatient Characteristics of Out-of-Hospital Nontraumatic Cardiac Arrests During COVID-19 and 1 Year Beforea\nCharacteristic	Cardiac arrest resuscitations	 	Main analysis (n = 5325)b	Sensitivity analysis peak period (n = 2292)c	 	Comparison period (n = 1336)	COVID-19 period (n = 3989)	Comparison period (n = 341)	COVID-19 period (n = 1951)	 	Age, mean (SD), y	68 (19)	72 (18)	69 (18)	72 (15)	 	Maled	752 (57.1)	2183 (55.8)	200 (59.9)	1085 (57.0)	 	Racee					 	 White	382 (32.9)	611 (20.4)	87 (30.3)	244 (17.6)	 	 Asian	88 (7.6)	218 (7.3)	19 (6.6)	96 (6.9)	 	 Black	332 (28.6)	1025 (34.3)	89 (31.0)	486 (35.0)	 	 Hispanic	239 (20.6)	763 (25.5)	64 (22.3)	391 (28.1)	 	 Mixed	120 (10.3)	375 (12.5)	28 (9.8)	172 (12.4)	 	Medical history					 	 Cardiac disease	397 (29.7)	1008 (25.3)	105 (30.8)	465 (23.8)	 	 Hypertension	611 (45.7)	2134 (53.5)	157 (46.0)	1039 (53.3)	 	 Diabetes	348 (26.0)	1424 (35.7)	81 (23.8)	708 (36.3)	 	 Renal disease	105 (7.9)	313 (7.8)	28 (8.2)	137 (7.0)	 	 Asthma/COPD	214 (16.0)	509 (12.8)	57 (16.7)	227 (11.6)	 	 Cancer	125 (9.4)	282 (7.1)	39 (11.4)	114 (5.8)	 	 CVA	90 (6.7)	228 (5.7)	20 (5.9)	114 (5.8)	 	Physical limitations	634 (47.5)	2259 (56.6)	164 (48.1)	1128 (57.8)	 	Bystander witnessed	404 (30.2)	1080 (27.1)	106 (31.1)	516 (26.4)	 	Bystander CPR	441 (33.0)	1359 (34.1)	109 (32.0)	657 (33.7)	 	Presenting rhythmf					 	 Ventricular rhythmsg	38 (11.0)	45 (3.6)	13 (13.8)	17 (2.9)	 	 Asystole	209 (60.6)	973 (77.6)	53 (56.4)	475 (80.7)	 	 PEA	72 (20.9)	177 (14.1)	21 (22.3)	64 (10.9)	 	\nAbbreviations: COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019; CPR, cardiopulmonary resuscitation; CVA, cerebrovascular accident; PEA, pulseless electrical activity.\nStudy population used for these estimates includes only patients who received resuscitation by emergency medical services.

By contrast, the odds of cardiac disease, asthma/COPD, cancer, and cerebrovascular accidents were not increased in 2020 relative to 2019. During the COVID-19 period, out-of-hospital cardiac arrests were 3.5 times more likely to present in asystole (OR, 3.50; 95% CI, 2.53-4.84; P &lt; .001) and twice as likely to present in pulseless electrical activity (OR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.31-3.02; P = .001) than in ventricular rhythms (ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia).\nAssociation of Risk Factors With Out-of-Hospital Nontraumatic Cardiac Arrests in the COVID-19 Period vs 1 Year Beforea\nRisk factor	Main analysisb	Sensitivity analysis peak periodc	 	OR (95% CI)	P value	OR (95% CI)	P value	 	Age (per 10 y)	1.12 (1.07-1.18)	&lt;.001	1.16 (1.05-1.27)	.003	 	Sex					 	 Female	1 [Reference]		1 [Reference]		 	 Male	0.92 (0.79-1.06)	.25	1.05 (0.79-1.39)	.74	 	Race/ethnicity					 	 White	1 [Reference]		1 [Reference]		 	 Asian	1.43 (1.08-1.91)	.01	1.82 (1.01-3.28)	.05	 	 Black	1.90 (1.57-2.29)	&lt;.001	1.91 (1.33-2.74)	&lt;.001	 	 Hispanic	2.06 (1.68-2.52)	&lt;.001	2.28 (1.54-3.37)	&lt;.001	 	 Mixed	1.96 (1.52-2.53)	&lt;.001	1.99 (1.21-3.28)	.007	 	Medical history					 	 Cardiac disease	0.72 (0.61-0.86)	&lt;.001	0.67 (0.49-0.93)	.02	 	 Hypertension	1.28 (1.09-1.50)	.002	1.27 (0.94-1.73)	.12	 	 Diabetes	1.45 (1.23-1.71)	&lt;.001	1.81 (1.31-2.51)	&lt;.001	 	 Renal disease	0.79 (0.60-1.03)	.08	0.64 (0.39-1.06)	.09	 	 Asthma/COPD	0.78 (0.64-0.95)	.02	0.67 (0.45-0.99)	.05	 	 Cancer	0.72 (0.56-0.92)	.009	0.59 (0.37-0.94)	.03	 	 CVA	0.70 (0.52-0.94)	.02	0.74 (0.41-1.32)	.30	 	Physical limitations	1.27 (1.09-1.49)	.002	1.38 (1.03-1.86)	.04	 	Presenting rhythmd					 	 Ventricular rhythmse	1 [Reference]		1 [Reference]		 	 Asystole	3.50 (2.53-4.84)	&lt;.001	5.37 (3.01-9.58)	&lt;.001	 	 PEA	1.99 (1.31-3.02)	.001	2.77 (1.29-5.91)	.009	 	\nAbbreviations: COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019; CVA, cerebrovascular accident; OR, odds ratio; PEA, pulseless electrical activity.\nStudy population used for these estimates includes only those out-of-hospital cardiac arrests who received resuscitation by emergency medical services.\nCovers March 1 to April 25, 2019 (comparison period) and 2020 (COVID-19 period).\nCovers March 29 to April 11, 2019 (comparison period) and 2020 (COVID-19 period).\nPresenting rhythm data were only collected for those out-of-hospital cardiac arrests in which an advanced life support unit was first on the scene; however, an unclassified category was added for missing data to bolster model observations.\nVentricular rhythms include ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia.\nTable 3 displays ALS interventions and outcomes for patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest who underwent EMS resuscitation during each period. Rates of ROSC (727 of 3989 patients [18.2%] vs 463 of 1336 patients [34.7%]; P &lt; .001) and sustained ROSC (423 of 3989 patients [10.6%] vs 337 of 1336 patients [25.2%]; P &lt; .001) were significantly lower during the COVID-19 period than in 2019. Furthermore, patients during the COVID-19 period were significantly more likely to have resuscitation terminated in the field compared with patients from the 2019 period (3566 of 3989 [89.4%] vs 999 of 1336 [74.8%]; P &lt; .001), reflecting the inability to obtain ROSC or sustained ROSC after at least 20 minutes of resuscitation. When examining only excess cases, resuscitation terminated in 2020 increased to 2567 of 2653 patients (96.8%). Despite marked differences in outcome, bystander-witnessed arrests, bystander CPR, time to first unit on the scene, time to ALS on the scene, and duration of resuscitation were similar in both time periods.\nOutcomes of Patients With Out-of-Hospital Nontraumatic Cardiac Arrest Resuscitations in the COVID-19 Period vs 1 Year Beforea\nVariable	Cardiac arrest resuscitations	 	Main analysis (n = 5325)b	Sensitivity analysis peak period (n = 2292)c	 	Comparison period (n = 1336)	COVID-19 period (n = 3989)	Comparison period (n = 341)	COVID-19 period (n = 1951)	 	ROSC, No. (%)d	463 (34.7)	727 (18.2)	133 (39.0)	297 (15.2)	 	Sustained ROSC, No. (%)	337 (25.2)	423 (10.6)	96 (28.2)	153 (7.8)	 	Resuscitation terminated in field	999 (74.8)	3566 (89.4)	245 (71.9)	1798 (92.2)	 	Time to first unit on scene, median (IQR), min:s	5:05 (2:17-7:13)	5:56 (2:14-9:38)	5:03 (2:36-7:30)	6:38 (2:08-10:28)	 	Time to ALS unit on scene, median (IQR), min:s	7:32 (2:27-13:17)	9:60 (0:43-19:17)	7:22 (2:24-12:20)	11:17 (1:07-22:07)	 	Total resuscitation time, median (IQR), min:s	34:58 (20:15-49:01)	32:18 (16:33-48:03)	35:17 (21:14-49:20)	30:55 (16:18-45:32)	 	ALS unit first on scene, No. (%)	345 (25.8)	1254 (31.4)	94 (27.6)	589 (30.2)	 	Shock delivered prior to ALS unit arrival, No. (%)	79 (5.9)	109 (2.7)	20 (5.9)	43 (2.2)	 	Airway, No. (%)					 	 Endotracheal intubation	1011 (75.7)	1915 (48.0)	245 (71.8)	825 (42.3)	 	 Supraglottic airway	193 (14.4)	1385 (34.7)	59 (17.3)	706 (36.2)	 	 Bag valve mask	132 (9.9)	689 (17.3)	37 (10.9)	420 (21.5)	 	Medications administered, No. (%)					 	 None	75 (5.6)	455 (11.4)	27 (7.9)	312 (16.0)	 	 Epinephrine	1238 (92.7)	3516 (88.1)	310 (90.9)	1633 (83.7)	 	 Amiodarone	143 (10.7)	231 (5.8)	33 (9.7)	77 (3.9)	 	 Dextrose	193 (14.4)	328 (8.2)	40 (11.7)	132 (6.8)	 	 Sodium bicarbonate	598 (44.8)	909 (22.8)	164 (48.1)	302 (15.5)	 	 Naloxone	89 (6.7)	67 (1.7)	19 (5.6)	17 (0.9)	 	 Magnesium	43 (3.2)	38 (1.0)	4 (1.2)	9 (0.5)	 	\nAbbreviations: ALS, advanced life support; COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019; IQR, interquartile range; ROSC, return of spontaneous circulation.\nStudy population used for these estimates includes only those with out-of-hospital cardiac arrests who received resuscitation by emergency medical services.\nCovers March 1 to April 25, 2019 (comparison period) and 2020 (COVID-19 period).\nCovers March 29 to April 11, 2019 (comparison period) and 2020 (COVID-19 period).\nROSC and sustained ROSC are not mutually exclusive, but patients must be either in sustained ROSC or have resuscitation terminated.\nTo assess for potential confounding, multivariate logistic regression (Table 4) confirmed that compared with 2019, patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in 2020 were 41% less likely to attain ROSC (OR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.50-0.70; P &lt; .001) and 47% less likely to attain sustained ROSC (OR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.43-0.64; P &lt; .001).

Compared with ventricular rhythms, presenting rhythms of asystole and pulseless electrical activity were significantly associated with lower likelihood of achieving ROSC (OR for asystole, 0.26 [95% CI, 0.17-0.41; P &lt; .001]; OR for pulseless electrical activity, 0.56 [95% CI, 0.33-0.95; P = .03]) or sustained ROSC (OR for asystole, 0.25 [95% CI, 0.15-0.41; P &lt; .001]; OR for pulseless electrical activity, 0.50 [95% CI, 0.29-0.89; P = .02]).\nAssociation of COVID-19 With ROSC and Sustained ROSC Adjusted for Demographics, Interventions, and Response Timea\nIntervention or risk factor	ROSC	Sustained ROSC	 	Main analysis	Sensitivity analysis peak period	Main analysis	Sensitivity analysis peak period	 	OR (95% CI)	P valueb	OR (95% CI)	P valueb	OR (95% CI)	P valueb	OR (95% CI)	P valueb	 	Study period									 	 Comparison	1 [Reference]		1 [Reference]		1 [Reference]		1 [Reference]		 	 COVID-19	0.59 (0.50-0.70)	&lt;.001	0.44 (0.32-0.60)	&lt;.001	0.53 (0.43-0.64)	&lt;.001	0.38 (0.26-0.56)	&lt;.001	 	Age (per 10 y)	1.00 (0.96-1.05)	.97	0.92 (0.84-1.01)	.07	0.97 (0.91-1.02)	.25	0.90 (0.81-1.01)	.07	 	Sex									 	 Female	1 [Reference]		1 [Reference]		1 [Reference]		1 [Reference]		 	 Male	1.53 (1.31-1.79)	&lt;.001	1.55 (1.18-2.04)	.002	1.59 (1.32-1.93)	&lt;.001	1.60 (1.13-2.25)	.007	 	Race/ethnicity									 	 White	1 [Reference]		1 [Reference]		1 [Reference]		1 [Reference]		 	 Asian	1.11 (0.81-1.52)	.52	1.09 (0.62-1.91)	.76	1.16 (0.80-1.68)	.44	0.77 (0.37-1.61)	.49	 	 Black	0.79 (0.64-0.98)	.03	0.73 (0.50-1.06)	.10	0.68 (0.53-0.87)	.002	0.60 (0.38-0.95)	.03	 	 Hispanic	0.89 (0.72-1.12)	.33	0.94 (0.64-1.39)	.77	0.86 (0.66-1.11)	.25	0.78 (0.48-1.25)	.30	 	 Mixed	1.12 (0.85-1.48)	.41	1.10 (0.67-1.80)	.70	1.21 (0.89-1.65)	.23	1.19 (0.66-2.12)	.56	 	Medical history									 	 Cardiac disease	1.13 (0.94-1.36)	.18	0.93 (0.67-1.28)	.65	1.30 (1.05-1.61)	.02	1.16 (0.78-1.72)	.47	 	 Hypertension	0.98 (0.83-1.17)	.84	1.09 (0.81-1.46)	.59	1.00 (0.82-1.23)	.98	1.12 (0.77-1.63)	.56	 	 Diabetes	0.93 (0.77-1.11)	.39	0.78 (0.58-1.06)	.11	0.85 (0.68-1.05)	.14	0.83 (0.56-1.23)	.35	 	 Renal disease	1.22 (0.92-1.62)	.17	1.29 (0.79-2.12)	.31	1.28 (0.92-1.79)	.15	0.95 (0.49-1.82)	.87	 	 Asthma/COPD	1.30 (1.05-1.61)	.02	1.20 (0.82-1.76)	.35	1.32 (1.03-1.70)	.03	1.27 (0.80-2.03)	.31	 	 Cancer	1.11 (0.83-1.47)	.48	0.98 (0.60-1.63)	.95	0.98 (0.70-1.39)	.93	0.81 (0.42-1.56)	.52	 	 CVA	0.75 (0.52-1.06)	.11	1.01 (0.56-1.81)	.97	0.83 (0.55-1.25)	.36	1.33 (0.67-2.63)	.41	 	Physical limitations	0.56 (0.47-0.67)	&lt;.001	0.74 (0.55-1.00)	.05	0.59 (0.47-0.73)	&lt;.001	0.73 (0.50-1.07)	.10	 	Bystander CPR									 	 No	1 [Reference]		1 [Reference]		1 [Reference]		1 [Reference]		 	 Yes	1.18 (0.99-1.40)	.06	1.27 (0.95-1.71)	.11	1.31 (1.07-1.60)	.009	1.52 (1.06-2.19)	.02	 	Response time, min									 	 &gt;=6 	1 [Reference]		1 [Reference]		1 [Reference]		1 [Reference]		 	 &lt;6 	1.09 (0.93-1.28)	.30	1.06 (0.81-1.40)	.66	1.38 (1.13-1.69)	.002	1.32 (0.93-1.88)	.12	 	ALS unit first on scene									 	 No	1 [Reference]		1 [Reference]		1 [Reference]		1 [Reference]		 	 Yes	2.44 (1.60-3.73)	&lt;.001	2.70 (1.31-5.58)	.007	2.84 (1.81-4.45)	&lt;.001	3.29 (1.49-7.22)	.003	 	ALS medication administration									 	 No	1 [Reference]		1 [Reference]		1 [Reference]		1 [Reference]		 	 Yes	1.65 (1.08-2.52)	.02	2.46 (1.24-4.89)	.01	1.25 (0.78-1.99)	.36	1.81 (0.80-4.07)	.15	 	Airway maintenance									 	 Endotracheal intubation	1 [Reference]		1 [Reference]		1 [Reference]		1 [Reference]		 	 Supraglottic airway	0.48 (0.40-0.58)	&lt;.001	0.52 (0.39-0.71)	&lt;.001	0.41 (0.32-0.52)	&lt;.001	0.50 (0.33-0.74)	&lt;.001	 	 Bag valve mask	0.50 (0.37-0.68)	&lt;.001	0.50 (0.29-0.85)	.01	0.60 (0.42-0.86)	.005	0.57 (0.29-1.09)	.09	 	Presenting rhythmc									 	 Ventricular rhythmsd	1 [Reference]		1 [Reference]		1 [Reference]		1 [Reference]		 	 Asystole	0.26 (0.17-0.41)	&lt;.001	0.21 (0.10-0.44)	&lt;.001	0.25 (0.15-0.41)	&lt;.001	0.16 (0.07-0.36)	&lt;.001	 	 PEA	0.56 (0.33-0.95)	.03	0.60 (0.25-1.47)	.27	0.50 (0.29-0.89)	.02	0.36 (0.13-0.98)	.05	 	\nAbbreviations: ALS, advanced life support; COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019; CPR, cardiopulmonary resuscitation; CVAs, cerebrovascular accidents; NA, not applicable; OR, odds ratio; PEA, pulseless electrical activity; ROSC, return of spontaneous circulation.\nStudy population used for these estimates includes only those with out-of-hospital cardiac arrests who received resuscitation by emergency medical services. Main study period covered March 1 to April 25, 2019 (comparison period) and 2020 (COVID-19 period); sensitivity time period, March 29 to April 11, 2019 (comparison period) and 2020 (COVID-19 period).\nCalculated using logistic regression.\nPresenting rhythm data were only collected for those out-of-hospital cardiac arrests in which an ALS unit was first on the scene; however, an unclassified category was added for missing data to bolster model observations.\nVentricular rhythm includes ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia.\nOur 2 sensitivity analyses revealed the same associations as did our main model (Table 2). For ROSC and sustained ROSC, results from our sensitivity analysis were nearly identical to those in Table 4 in the direction of associations, although some factors lost statistical significance for ROSC (being black and having a presenting rhythm of pulseless electrical activity) or for sustained ROSC (history of asthma/COPD, physical activity limitations, and a response time of &gt;=6 minutes). Return of spontaneous circulation and sustained ROSC were both significantly lower during the 2-week COVID-19 peak period in both sensitivity analyses. For example, when compared with the same 2 weeks in 2019, ROSC occurred in 297 of 1951 patients with out-of-hospital nontraumatic cardiac arrest (15.2%) vs 133 of 341 patients (39.0%) (P &lt; .001) and sustained ROSC was attained in 153 of 1951 patients (7.8%) vs 96 of 341 patients (28.2%) (P &lt; .001). Similarly, when compared with the 2 weeks before plus the 2 weeks after the peak 2020 period, ROSC occurred in 297 of 1951 patients (15.2%) vs 430 of 2038 patients (21.1%) (P &lt; .001), and sustained ROSC occurred in 153 of 1951 patients (7.8%) vs 270 of 2038 patients (13.3%) (P &lt; .001).\nDiscussion\nUsing data from the NYC 911 EMS system during the COVID-19 pandemic, we report 2653 excess out-of-hospital cardiac arrests, a number that, by itself, represents double the number of patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrests who underwent EMS resuscitation during the comparable 2019 period. More than 90% of these excess cases resulted in out-of-hospital deaths, some of which likely contributed to the 17 118 confirmed and suspected COVID-19-related deaths that occurred in NYC during the first 8 weeks of the pandemic. Risk factors for excess COVID-19-related out-of-hospital cardiac arrests included older age and minority race/ethnicity, after adjustment for comorbidities. Importantly, nonshockable presenting rhythms of asystole and pulseless electrical activity were more commonly documented in 2020 compared with 2019 and likely account for the substantial increase in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest mortality.\nConditions associated with COVID-19, including hypoxemic respiratory failure, massive myocardial infarction, and pulmonary emboli, can lead to rapid decompensation and result in cardiac arrest with initial nonshockable rhythms. Our results were similar to those observed in Northern Italy, where out-of-hospital cardiac arrests increased by 58% from the same time period in 2019. Italy had an increase in out-of-hospital mortality from 67.3% to 82.2% and an increase of initial nonshockable rhythms from 83% to 90%. In Wuhan, China, unsuccessful resuscitation for in-hospital cardiac arrests occurred 86.8% of the time, with 89.7% of patients having asystole as the initial presenting rhythm.\nIncreased out-of-hospital cardiac arrests during influenza are thought to be due to the body's systemic inflammatory response, which destabilizes atherosclerotic plaques that, in turn, produce myocardial infarctions and cardiovascular deaths. In addition to overwhelming pneumonia, viral sepsis, and acute respiratory failure, COVID-19 causes endothelial injury predisposing to thrombosis in the arterial and venous system with myocardial infarction in the absence of atherosclerosis and increased risk of venous thromboembolism. Declining oxygenation and biomarkers of tissue injury (elevated levels of cardiac troponins, cytokines, D-dimer, and lactate) are risk factors for death in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.\nSimilar to risk factors for death in hospitalized patients, we found that increasing age, hypertension, and diabetes were independent risk factors for patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest during 2020. We also observed that patients reported to have physical activity limitations, such as being bed or wheelchair bound, were at increased risk for COVID-19-related out-of-hospital cardiac arrests. Immobility may be a marker for frailty and is a risk factor for thromboembolic disease. Although sex, asthma/COPD, prior cardiac disease, and cerebrovascular accidents are known risk factors for in-hospital cardiac deaths, they were not risk factors in our study of excess out-of-hospital cardiac arrests in 2020. This may be because these comorbidities were risks for out-of-hospital cardiac arrests in the comparison 2019 period and therefore did not contribute significantly to excess out-of-hospital cardiac arrest cases in 2020.\nIn our study, minority race/ethnicity was a risk factor for COVID-19-related out-of-hospital cardiac arrests even after adjusting for comorbidities that disproportionately affect minority populations. Black, Hispanic, and Asian patients were at increased risk for COVID-19-associated out-of-hospital cardiac arrests and death. Explanations for these disparities are multifactorial, difficult to disaggregate, and range from individual vulnerabilities to social/environmental factors. The disparate burden of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests in minority populations may be a consequence of underlying comorbidities, genetic-environmental interactions, socioeconomic conditions that include increased viral exposure due to crowding and reduced opportunity to work from home, as well as reduced access to health care.\nAlthough we observed a temporal association (without time lag) between NYC 911 EMS calls for fever, cough, dyspnea, and viral-like symptoms and out-of-hospital cardiac arrests, that in itself is insufficient to demonstrate that excess out-of-hospital cardiac arrests and deaths after attempted resuscitation were solely owing to sudden cardiopulmonary decompensation from COVID-19 infection. The observed temporal relationship does not preclude other explanations, such as the possibility that delays in seeking or receiving health care may have negatively affected slowly progressive COVID-19 infections or preexisting conditions (eg, cardiopulmonary diseases or cancer), resulting in out-of-hospital cardiac arrests and deaths. During this period, hospitals reported few admissions for other conditions, and in Italy, admission rates for acute coronary syndrome significantly declined. Reasons for such delays may include not only lack of health care access but also purposeful avoidance due to fears of contracting COVID-19. In addition, pandemic-related environmental, emotional, and economic stressors could have indirectly contributed to excess out-of-hospital cardiac arrests and deaths. Because our data cannot address the proportion of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests that was directly or indirectly due to COVID-19, further research is needed. Even before the results of further research are available, the increased COVID-19-related out-of-hospital cardiac arrest rates in our study reinforce the need for improved health care outreach during pandemics, especially for vulnerable populations.\nOur results agree with established findings of higher rates of sustained ROSC with shorter EMS response time. With the increased number of patients presenting with COVID-19-like symptoms, the median response time of available EMS units to out-of-hospital cardiac arrests was increased by approximately 1 minute; however, this difference was not statistically significant when compared with the same period in 2019. Although the time range was variable, the median response time was less than the 3-minute increase reported in Italy. In contrast, if ALS units arrived first on the scene, we observed significantly higher rates of ROSC and sustained ROSC compared with other units, even during the COVID-19 period. Studies characterizing the association of prehospital ALS management with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in the pre-COVID-19 era report conflicting results. In our study, ALS interventions (ACLS medications and endotracheal intubation) were associated with significant increases in both ROSC and sustained ROSC (Table 4) in all analyses. We speculate that these ALS interventions were more likely to occur and to be successful when ALS units were first on the scene. In addition, paramedics' higher training and medical knowledge provide critical skills in patient assessment that lead to effective treatment decisions and team-based leadership during resuscitations.\nDuring the COVID-19 study period, less invasive airway management (supraglottic airway or bag-valve-mask ventilation) was associated with lower rates of ROSC and sustained ROSC. Several studies, including a meta-analysis, have shown increased ROSC rates and overall survival to hospital discharge with endotracheal intubation, although the mechanism for this improvement has not yet been elucidated. The significant decrease in the use of more invasive procedures, such as endotracheal intubation, in favor of less invasive procedures (supraglottic airways and bag-valve-mask ventilation) may be due to EMS responders wanting to reduce exposure to the patient during the COVID-19 pandemic. This may have been a concern despite the availability of personal protective equipment, including fresh N95 masks, eye protection, gowns, and gloves that were supplied to and required of all personnel during resuscitations. This finding was similarly observed in the management of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests in Italy at the height of their response to COVID-19.\nLimitations\nOur study shares several limitations found in recently published COVID-19 in-hospital mortality studies. First, our study population was limited to those who received care, in this case, EMS resuscitation. Second, because postmortem testing to confirm COVID-19 was rarely performed, we cannot distinguish between increased cardiopulmonary arrests directly due to COVID-19 or indirectly due to unattended comorbid diseases during this pandemic. Support for the increase in out-of-hospital cardiac arrests being directly COVID-19 related in our study and for a similar trend in the study from Italy is based on comparisons with the prior year. We acknowledge that although cardiovascular disease, asthma/COPD, cerebrovascular accidents, and cancer were not risk factors for out-of-hospital cardiac arrests during the COVID-19 pandemic in our study, patient lack of access to or avoidance of health care leading to acute decompensation of comorbid illnesses may have played a role. We do not believe that reliance on prehospital patient information for comorbid history resulted in differential misclassification, because the same method was used in both periods (2019 and 2020), and the percentage of bystander-witnessed events was similar. Ultimately, corroboration by death certificates, along with autopsy studies, is required to determine the proportion of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests and deaths that were related to COVID-19. A strength of the current investigation is the longitudinal, system-wide ascertainment of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests and resuscitations in the largest US 911 system during the largest pandemic since the 1918 influenza pandemic. By including data from the entire 911 system and comparing it with the same time period 1 year prior, the potential for differential ascertainment biases was minimized. By choosing the longer period as our main analysis rather than the 2-week COVID-19 peak period, we purposely biased our results toward the null.\nConclusions\nThe tragedy of the COVID-19 pandemic is not just the number of patients infected, but the large increase in out-of-hospital cardiac arrests and deaths. This catastrophe transpired despite similar rates of bystander CPR, similar EMS response times, and similar durations of resuscitation efforts, compared with 2019. The findings of this cross-sectional study emphasize the importance of intervening early in the course of COVID-19 infection, before acute decompensation. They also speak to the critical need to design better systems for providing health care access to vulnerable, at-risk patients with acute and chronic conditions during a pandemic. Aggressive efforts for identifying outpatient risk factors for out-of-hospital cardiac arrests and death, such as hypoxia and hypercoagulability, especially in minority populations, should be instituted. Further research is needed to determine if early, targeted interventions in the outpatient setting for those at risk, such as regular telemedicine visits and home-based monitoring of vital signs, oxygen saturation, and biomarkers of tissue injury in those that test positive could lead to reductions in out-of-hospital fatalities.\nReferences\nOut-of-hospital cardiac arrest during the Covid-19

pandemic.\n\n We conducted a serologic survey to estimate the cumulative incidence of A(H1N1)pdm09 through the end of 2009 when pandemic activity had waned in the United States.\n\n\nMethods\nWe conducted a pair of cross sectional serologic surveys before and after the spring/fall waves of the pandemic for evidence of seropositivity (titer ?40) using the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay.\n\n We tested a baseline sample of 1,142 serum specimens from the 2007–2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), and 2,759 serum specimens submitted for routine screening to clinical diagnostic laboratories from ten representative sites.\n\n\nResults\nThe age-adjusted prevalence of seropositivity to A(H1N1)pdm09 by year-end 2009 was 36.9% (95%CI: 31.7–42.2%).\n\n After adjusting for baseline cross-reactive antibody, pandemic vaccination coverage and the sensitivity/specificity of the HI assay, we estimate that 20.2% (95%CI: 10.1–28.3%) of the population was infected with A(H1N1)pdm09 by December 2009, including 53.3% (95%CI: 39.0–67.1%) of children aged 5–17 years.\n\n\nConclusions\nBy December 2009, approximately one-fifth of the US population, or 61.9 million persons, may have been infected with A(H1N1)pdm09, including around half of school-aged children.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3485186","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

Influenza Surveillance through Twitter: An Analysis of the 2012-2013 Influenza Epidemic","abstract":"Social media have been proposed as a data source for influenza surveillance because they have the potential to offer real-time access to millions of short, geographically localized messages containing information regarding personal well-being.\n However, accuracy of social media surveillance systems declines with media attention because media attention increases “chatter” – messages that are about influenza but that do not pertain to an actual infection – masking signs of true influenza prevalence.\n This paper summarizes our recently developed influenza infection detection algorithm that automatically distinguishes relevant tweets from other chatter, and we describe our current influenza surveillance system which was actively deployed during the full 2012-2013 influenza season.\n Our objective was to analyze the performance of this system during the most recent 2012–2013 influenza season and to analyze the performance at multiple levels of geographic granularity, unlike past studies that focused on national or regional surveillance.\n Our system’s influenza prevalence estimates were strongly correlated with surveillance data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the United States (r = 0.93, p &lt; 0.001) as well as surveillance data from the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene of New York City (r = 0.88, p &lt; 0.001).\n Our system detected the weekly change in direction (increasing or decreasing) of influenza prevalence with 85% accuracy, a nearly twofold increase over a simpler model, demonstrating the utility of explicitly distinguishing infection tweets from other chatter.\n","id":"PMC3857320","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"David

studied weekly death due to acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and chronic ischaemic heart disease (IHD) in autopsies conducted in 1993 to 2000 in St Petersburg, Russia.\n\n We plotted the weekly acute respiratory disease (ARD) counts and influenza epidemics against AMI and chronic IHD deaths.\n\n There were 11 892 subjects dying of AMI and 23 000 subjects dying of chronic IHD.\n\n Median age was 75 for women and 65 for men.\n\n In every year, a peak of AMI and chronic IHD deaths were present and coincided with the influenza epidemic and peak ARD activity.\n\n A similar pattern was seen for each subgroup of men, women, subjects 50 years or older, and subjects 70 years or older.\n\n When comparing the average influenza epidemic weeks to average off-season weeks, the odds for AMI and chronic IHD death increased by 1.30 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.08–1.56) and 1.10 (95% CI: 0.97–1.26), respectively.\n\n\nConclusion\nInfluenza epidemics are associated with a rise in autopsy-confirmed

describe the characteristics and outcomes of patients with severe COVID-19 and in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) in Wuhan, China.\n\n\nMethods\nThe outcomes of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia after IHCA over a 40-day period were retrospectively evaluated.\n\n Between January 15 and February 25, 2020, data for all cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) attempts for IHCA that occurred in a tertiary teaching hospital in Wuhan, China were collected according to the Utstein style.\n\n The primary outcome was restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), and the secondary outcomes were 30-day survival, and neurological outcome.\n\n\nResults\nData from 136 patients showed 119 (87.5%) patients had a respiratory cause for their cardiac arrest, and 113 (83.1%) were resuscitated in a general ward.\n\n The initial rhythm was asystole in 89.7%, pulseless electrical activity (PEA) in 4.4%, and shockable in 5.9%.\n\n Most patients with IHCA were monitored (93.4%) and in most resuscitation (89%) was initiated &lt;1?min.\n\n The average length of hospital stay was 7 days and the time from illness onset to hospital admission was 10 days.\n\n The most frequent comorbidity was hypertension (30.2%), and the most frequent symptom was shortness of breath (75%).\n\n Of the patients receiving CPR, ROSC was achieved in 18 (13.2%) patients, 4 (2.9%) patients survived for at least 30 days, and one patient achieved a favourable neurological outcome at 30 days.\n\n Cardiac arrest location and initial rhythm were associated with better outcomes.\n\n\nConclusion\nSurvival of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia who had an in-hospital cardiac arrest was poor in Wuhan.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7151543","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

papulosis","abstract":"Background\nDegos disease is a frequently fatal and incurable occlusive vasculopathy most commonly affecting the skin, gastrointestinal tract and brain.\n\n Vascular C5b-9 deposition and a type I interferon (IFN) rich microenvironment are held to be pathogenetically important in the evolution of the vascular changes.\n\n We recently discovered the use of eculizumab as a salvage drug in the treatment of near fatal Malignant atrophic papulosis (MAP).\n\n The effects of eculizumab on the pathology of MAP are explored.\n\n\nMethods\nArchival skin and gastrointestinal biopsy material was procured over a 2.5-year period before and after eculizumab therapy in our index case.\n\n Routine light microscopy and immunohistochemical assessment for C3d, C4d, C5b-9, MxA and caspase 3 were examined.\n\n Direct immunofluorescent studies were also conducted on select biopsy material.\n\n\nResults\nThe patient had received eculizumab as a emergent life saving measure and following rapid improvement he continued with biweekly infusions for 4 years.\n\n Although improved he continues to have signs and symptoms of persistent abdominal disease.\n\n Pre-Eculizumab biopsies showed an active thrombotic microangiopathy associated with a high type I interferon signature and extensive vascular deposits of C5b-9 in skin and gastrointestinal biopsies.\n\n Endothelial cell apoptosis as revealed by Caspase 3 expression was noted.\n\n Inflammation comprising lymphocytes and macrophages along with mesenchymal mucin was observed as well.\n\n Post-eculizumab biopsies did not show active luminal thrombosis but only chronic sequelae of prior episodes of vascular injury.\n\n There was no discernible caspase 3 expression.\n\n After 12 months of therapy, C5b-9 was no longer detectable in tissue.\n\n The high type I IFN signature and inflammation along with mucin deposition was not altered by the drug.\n\n In addition, there was little effect of the drug on the occlusive fibrointimal arteriopathy which appears to be one characterized by extensive myofibroblastic expansion of the intima potentially as revealed by staining for smooth muscle actin without immunoreactivity for desmin and myogenin.\n\n\nConclusions\nComplement activation and enhanced endothelial cell apoptosis play an important role in the thrombotic complications of MAP.\n\n However, the larger vessel proliferative intimal changes appear to be independent of complement activation and may be on the basis of other upstream mechanisms.\n\n Monitoring C5b-9 deposition in tissue is likely not of great value in assessing treatment response to eculizumab given the persistence of C5b-9 in tissue for several months despite clinically effective C5 blocking therapy.\n\n A more integrated approach addressing upstream and downstream pathways in addition to those attributable to complement activation are critical for the successful treatment of MAP.\n\n Eculizumab may be used as salvage therapy in critically ill patients with thrombotic microangiopathy.\n\n \n","id":"PMC3879088","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

Initial immune and inflammatory responses induce a severe cytokine storm [interleukin (IL)-6, IL-7, IL-22, IL-17, etc.\n] during the rapid progression phase of COVID-19. Early evaluation and continued monitoring of cardiac damage (cTnI and NT-proBNP) and coagulation (D-dimer) after hospitalization may identify patients with cardiac injury and predict COVID-19 complications.\n Preventive measures (social distancing and social isolation) also increase cardiovascular risk.\n Cardiovascular considerations of therapies currently used, including remdesivir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, ribavirin, interferons, and lopinavir/ritonavir, as well as experimental therapies, such as human recombinant ACE2 (rhACE2), are discussed.\n","id":"PMC7197627","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Oxford University Press","authors":[{"firstname":"Tomasz

populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7121484","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical

SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

are refractory to current treatment, never achieve return of spontaneous circulation, or die before they reach the hospital.\n Therefore, we aimed to identify whether field resuscitation time is associated with survival rate in refractory OHCA (rOHCA) with a shockable initial rhythm.\n This cross-sectional retrospective study extracted data of emergency medical service (EMS)-treated patients aged ? 15 years with OHCA of suspected cardiac etiology and shockable initial rhythm confirmed by EMS providers from the OHCA registry database of Korea.\n A multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted for survival to discharge and good neurological outcomes in the scene time interval groups.\n The median scene time interval for the non-survival and survival to discharge patients were 16 (interquartile range (IQR) 13–21) minutes and 14 (IQR 12–16) minutes, respectively.\n In this study, for rOHCA patients with a shockable rhythm, continuing CPR for more than 15 min on the scene was associated with a decreased chance of survival and good neurological outcome.\n In particular, we found that in the patients whose transport time interval was &gt;10 min, the longer scene time

As hypothesized, fewer patients received bystander-initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and emergency medical services (EMS) arrival time and mortality were higher in both studies. In contrast, OHCA incidence and bystander-CPR in King County, USA remained similar to that of previous years. Accordingly, we decided to investigate whether these worrying observations were present in OHCAs occurring in the Province of Padua. Of note, Padua is the most populated and densely inhabited province of Veneto Region, northeast of Italy (2142 km2, 936,274 inhabitants) and, together with Lombardy, was the first area to have an outbreak of COVID-19 outside China. Between 21st February and 30th April 2020, a total of 17,960 COVID-19 cases were reported in the Veneto region.\nCharacteristics of OHCAs and EMS system between 1st March and 30th April 2020 and the same period in 2019.\nTable 1	 	\n	2020 (March 1-April 30)	2019 (March 1-April 30)	P value	 	Total number of calls received, n	32,047	27,193	/	 	 Calls received per day, mean (SD)	525 (97)	446 (44)	&lt;0.001	 	Emergency missions, n	14,629	13,714	/	 	 Emergency missions per day, mean (SD)	240 (27)	225 (18)	&lt;0.001	 	Total OHCA cases, n	200	206	/	 	Age, mean (SD)	79 (17)	77 (14)	0.23	 	Male sex, n (%)	89/175 (51%)	98/179 (55%)	0.46	 	Aetiology, n (%)				 	 Medical, n (%)	175/197 (89%)	179/204 (88%)	0.73	 	 Trauma, n (%)	15/197 (7.6%)	17/204 (8.3%)	0.79	 	 Drowning, n (%)	1/197 (0.5%)	0/204 (0%)	0.31	 	 Overdose, n (%)	0/197 (0%)	1/204 (0.5%)	0.32	 	 Electrocution, n (%)	0/197 (0%)	0/204 (0%)	/	 	 Asphyxia, n (%)	6/197 (3.0%)	7/204 (3.4%)	0.83	 	Bystander witnessed, n (%)	13/52 (25%)	17/59 (29%)	0.65	 	Bystander CPR, n (%)	10/55 (18%)	15/60 (25%)	0.38	 	Minutes between call and EMS arrival, median (IQR)	16 (12-22)	15 (11-19)	0.01	 	 Minutes between call and departure, median (IQR)	6.1 (4.8-8.7)	6.0 (4.6-7.2)	0.04	 	  Minutes between call and dispatch, median (IQR)	2.4 (1.7-3.1)	2.0 (1.6-2.8)	0.002	 	  Minutes between dispatch and departure, median (IQR)	3.9 (2.5-6.0)	3.5 (2.4-4.6)	0.003	 	 Minutes between EMS departure and arrival, median (IQR)	7.3 (5.4-11)	8.3 (5.7-12)	0.04	 	Resuscitation attempted by EMS, n (%)	45/114 (39%)	48/90 (53%)	0.048	 	Outcomes among EMS treated OHCAs				 	 ROSC, n (%)	2/45 (4.4%)	4/48 (8.3%)	0.45	 	 Transported with ongoing CPR, n (%)	4/45 (8.9%)	2/48 (4.2%)	0.35	 	 Out-of-hospital mortality, n (%)	39/45 (87%)	42/48 (87%)	0.90	 	Outcomes among all OHCAs				 	 ROSC, n (%)	2/200 (1.0%)	4/206 (1.9%)	0.43	 	 Transported with ongoing CPR, n (%)	4/200 (2.0%)	2/206 (1.0%)	0.39	 	 Out-of-hospital mortality, n (%)	194/200 (97%)	200/206 (97%)	0.96	 	\nCategorical variables are reported as number and percentage, and the continuous variables are presented as mean and standard deviation (SD) or as median and interquartile range (IQR). Continuous variables were compared with Student's t-test or the Mann-Whitney test, and categorical variables using the chi2 test. Statistical analysis was performed with Stata software (version 13, StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). Percentages may not total 100 because of rounding. CPR: cardiopulmonary resuscitation, EMS: emergency medical service, OHCA: out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, ROSC: return of spontaneous circulation.\nUsing retrospective data from the EMS database, we compared OHCAs occurred between 1st March and 30th April 2020 and the same period in 2019 (Table 1 ). During the active COVID-19 period, the EMS dispatch centre responsible for the study area had a 18% increase in daily calls (525 +- 97 vs 446 +- 44; P &lt; 0.001) and a 7% increase in daily ambulances missions (240 +- 27 vs 225 +- 18; P &lt; 0.001). During this period, EMS responded to a total of 200 OHCAs, consistent with the 206 OHCAs in the same period in 2019 and with characteristics of patients that did not differ substantially. We observed a numerical reduction in bystander-witnessed cases (13/52 [25%] vs. 17/59 [29%]; P = 0.65) and bystander-CPR rate (10/55 [18%] vs. 15/60 [25%]; P = 0.38). The median time between the call and EMS arrival was 1.2 min longer in 2020 than in 2019. When we break down the total arrival time in its main components (call to dispatch, dispatch to departure, and departure to arrival), we found that the culprit interval was the time between the call and EMS departure. In particular, a delay was seen during call taking and dispatch (2.4 [1.7-3.1] vs 2.0 [1.6-2.8]; P = 0.002) and between dispatch and departure (3.9 [2.5-6.0] vs 3.5 [2.4-4.6]; P = 0.003). The increase in the call taking and dispatch process can be explained by the need to ask questions about COVID-19 status (tested positive or COVID-like symptoms), and the increased dispatchers' workload (+17% of calls received). Instead, the delay in ambulances departure is mainly explained by the time needed to wear personal protective equipment. Also, ambulance sanitization and the moderate increase (+7%) in ambulance missions might account for departures delays. Interestingly, the time between EMS departure and arrival (i.e., road travel time) was significantly reduced (7.3 min [5.4-11] vs. 8.3 min [5.7-12]; P = 0.04), likely related to the 80% reduction in road traffic in the area due to lockdown (8th March-18th May 2020). Of note, resuscitation manoeuvres were less attempted by EMS (45/114 [39%] vs. 48/90 [53%]; P = 0.048) in the COVID-19 period, fear of infection might have contributed to this variation. Rates of ROSC, transport with ongoing CPR, and out-of-hospital death remained similar in the two periods.\nCompared with findings from Lombardy and Paris, we did not observe an increase in OHCA incidence and mortality, in line with what reported in Seattle and King County, USA. Instead, a delay in EMS arrival and a numerical reduction in bystander-CPR rate was observed. Further research is needed to clarify the direct and indirect effects of COVID-19 on OHCA, with particular attention to regional variations.\nConflicts of interest\nAll authors do not have conflict of interest to declare.\nReferences\nOut-of-hospital cardiac arrest during the Covid-19 outbreak in Italy\nOut-of-hospital cardiac arrest during the COVID-19 pandemic in Paris, France: a population-based, observational study\nThe other side of novel coronavirus outbreak: fear of performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation\nPrevalence of COVID-19 in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: implications for bystander CPR\nCOVID-19 - Mobility Trends Reports - Apple.
