This virus, which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has led to over 4.8 million infections and 316,000 deaths worldwide to date. Prior studies have demonstrated advanced age, chronic cardiopulmonary diseases, immunosuppression and obesity as potential risk factors for worse clinical outcomes among patients with COVID-19 - with mortality often driven by disease-associated cardiopulmonary failure. While the virus primarily affects the lungs, experience from China and the USA also suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may impact extra-pulmonary systems, including the gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary systems. \nChronic liver disease (CLD), including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), alcohol-related liver disease and chronic viral hepatitis, comprise a large global burden of disease. Published reports indicate that up to half of adults hospitalized with COVID-19 have abnormal aminotransferase levels and 2%-11% have underlying liver conditions. A meta-analysis of 11 observational studies of 2034 adults with COVID-19 from China revealed an overall CLD prevalence of 3%. However, there are limited reports on the nature of liver disease among COVID-19 patients and it remains unclear how underlying CLD influences hepatic injury and clinical outcomes in these patients. Higher rates of liver dysfunction have been observed in patients with more severe cases of COVID-19 and among those requiring admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Given the high prevalence of NAFLD in the USA, as well as metabolic syndrome and obesity being potential poor prognostic factors for COVID-19, we hypothesized that CLD, particularly NAFLD, may be associated with more severe clinical course and worse outcomes among patients with COVID-19. We therefore aimed to describe the characteristics of CLD and study the effect of existing liver-related comorbidities on the manifestations and outcomes of hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19.\nMETHODS\nStudy Design and Population\nWe performed a retrospective cohort study of all consecutive adult patients hospitalized with a positive SARS-CoV-2 infection via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) nasopharyngeal swab or tracheal aspirate from 11 March to 2 April 2020. Centres included were nine hospitals (two large tertiary centres and seven community hospitals) in a single healthcare system in Massachusetts, USA. All patients were followed to hospital discharge or death. Patient demographics, presence and type of CLD, comorbid conditions, laboratory data and clinically relevant hospitalization outcomes (including ICU admission, need for mechanical ventilation and in-hospital mortality) were obtained from electronic medical records. The presence of CLD was identified and confirmed through manual review of laboratory, imaging and/or histopathological data by the study investigators. NAFLD was defined by the presence of diffuse hepatic steatosis on any prior imaging studies or liver histology in the absence of secondary causes of hepatic fat accumulation including significant alcohol use, long-term use of steatogenic medications or hereditary disorders. Data on alcohol consumption and, when available, quantification were extracted through chart review. Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) was defined as presence of hepatitis B surface antigen for greater than 6 months, with or without detectable viremia. Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) was defined as history of HCV viremia, including those with cured infection who have evidence of liver fibrosis on histology or non-invasive testing. Among patients with underlying CLD, cirrhosis was defined by the presence of morphological features of cirrhosis with or without portal hypertension on abdominal imaging and/or liver histology. Decompensation was defined as the presence of ascites or hepatic encephalopathy on active treatment or history of variceal bleeding.\nOutcome Measures\nThe primary outcomes were measurements of disease severity among hospitalized COVID-19 patients with and without CLD, including the mean hospital length of stay, prevalence of ICU admission, rate of need for mechanical ventilation and all-cause in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included patient characteristics (age, gender, BMI and race), prevalence of medical comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, cardiac conditions and pulmonary disease), and laboratory results on admission (including alanine aminotransferases [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], total and direct bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase) among patients with CLD versus those without. Further analyses on clinical outcomes were also performed by stratifying patients with CLD into those with and without cirrhosis, and into NAFLD and non-NAFLD.\nStatistical Analyses\nContinuous variables were reported as means and standard deviations and categorical variables were expressed using numbers and frequencies. Student's t test and Fisher's Exact test were performed for univariate analyses for continuous and categorical variables respectively. Multivariable analyses were performed using logistic regression. All statistical analyses were performed using Statistical Analysis Software version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC, USA). The study protocol was approved by the Partners Healthcare Institutional Review Board (2020P00000983).\nRESULTS\nStudy population\nA total of 363 patients hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 were included, with a mean age of 63.4 years (SD +- 16.5) and 201 (55.4%) men. The mean body mass index (BMI) was 30.3 kg/m2 (SD +- 6.6). Conditions associated with metabolic syndrome were prevalent, including 117 (32.3%) patients with diabetes, 169 (46.6%) patients with dyslipidaemia and 212 (58.4%) patients with hypertension. Overall, 69 (19%) patients were found to have underlying CLD: 55 (15.2%) patients had NAFLD, 6 (1.7%) had compensated cirrhosis (including one with NAFLD, one with alcohol-related liver disease, three with HCV, one with HBV; two patients also had hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC]) and three (0.8%) patients had decompensated cirrhosis (two alcohol-related liver disease and one with previously treated HCV) (Table 1). The cohort did not include any liver transplant recipients.\nBaseline characteristics and admission laboratory data of patients hospitalized with CLD with COVID-19\nVariable	Chronic Liver Disease,n = 69	No Chronic Liver Disease,n = 294	P value	 	Age (years)	64.8 +- 15.0	63.0 +- 16.9	.42	 	Male (%)	37 (53.6)	164 (55.8)	.75	 	White (%)	35 (53.0)	142 (49.8)	.84	 	Black (%)	6 (9.0)	41 (14.4)		 	Hispanic (%)	20 (30.3)	81 (28.4)		 	Asian (%)	3 (4.6)	11 (3.9)		 	Other (%)	2 (3.0)	10 (3.5)		 	Tobacco Use (%)	10 (14.5)	31 (10.5)	.35	 	Alcohol Use (%)	13 (18.8)	34 (11.6)	.11	 	BMI	32.0 +- 6.8	29.9 +- 6.6	.018	 	Length of Stay (days)	13.4 +- 11.0	10.1 +- 8.0	.038	 	Chronic liver disease	 	NAFLD (%)	55 (79.7)			 	NAFLD and ALD (%)	1 (1.4)			 	HCV (%)a	6 (8.7)			 	HBV (%)	2 (2.9)			 	PBC (%)	1 (1.4)			 	Compensated cirrhosis: NAFLD (1), viral (4), alcohol (1); includes 2 hepatocellular carcinoma (1 HBV, 1 HCV), (%)	6 (8.7)			 	Decompensated cirrhosis: alcohol (2), HCV (1) (%)	3 (4.3)			 	Comorbidities	 	Hypertension (%)	45 (65.2)	167 (56.8)	.20	 	Diabetes mellitus (%)	28 (40.6)	89 (30.4)	.10	 	Hyperlipidaemia (%)	32 (46.4)	137 (46.6)	.97	 	Coronary artery disease (%)	10 (14.5)	42 (14.3)	.96	 	Congestive heart disease (%)	7 (10.1)	32 (10.9)	.85	 	Pulmonary diseaseb (%)	20 (29.0)	56 (19.1)	.07	 	Laboratory data on admission	 	Abnormal AST, n (%)	 	Admission	45 (66.2)	111 (38.8)	&lt;.0001	 	Peakc	59 (86.6)	195 (67.2)	.0014	 	Abnormal ALT, n (%)	 	Admission	26 (38.2)	77 (26.9)	.06	 	Peakc	44 (64.7)	169 (58.1)	.32	 	AST (U/L)	 	Admission	73.5 +- 83.2	45.5 +- 49.2	.0003	 	Peakc	153.8 +- 179.7	106.8 +- 213.5	.09	 	ALT (U/L)	 	Admission	49.0 +- 45.6	33.8 +- 28.3	.0006	 	Peakc	95.3 +- 89.0	78.5 +- 114.7	.26	 	Alkaline phosphatase (U/L)	92.4 +- 54.2	79.2 +- 39.3	.02	 	Total bilirubin (mg/dL)	0.95 +- 2.12	0.54 +- 0.48	.12	 	Platelet count (K/microL)	186.0 +- 74.7	200.1 +- 82.8	.20	 	Ferritin (ng/mL)	825.0 +- 850.0	843.5 +- 1117.1	.90	 	Lactate dehydrogenase (U/L)	381.2 +- 144.8	342.0 +- 187.4	.06	 	Peak creatinine phosphokinasec (U/L)	2810.3 +- 14 056	2517.2 +- 18 300	.90	 	International normalized ratio (INR)	1.22 +- 0.46	1.26 +- 0.48	.55	 	Creatinine (mg/dL)	1.18 +- 0.63	2.43 +- 15.1	.16	 	\nAbbreviations: ALD, alcoholic liver disease; BMI, body mass index (kg/m2); HBV, hepatitis B virus; HCV, hepatitis C virus; NAFLD, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; PBC, primary biliary cholangitis.\nAll the bold values highlight those with P &lt; .05.\n1 untreated, 5 cured (4 cirrhosis, 1 stage 3 fibrosis)\nchronic obstructive lung disease, asthma, pulmonary hypertension, interstitial lung disease\nPeak laboratory values throughout hospitalization\nImpact of chronic liver disease\nPatients with CLD had a greater prevalence of elevated aminotransferases ([AST 66.2% vs 38.8%, P &lt; .0001] and [ALT 38.2% vs 26.9%, P = .06]) on admission. Additionally, patients with underlying CLD had higher mean AST, ALT and alkaline phosphatase on admission compared to those without CLD. There was no difference in mean total bilirubin, platelet count, creatinine and international normalized ratio (INR) values on admission between the two groups. Peak AST and ALT values during hospitalization were not statistically higher among the CLD group. No significant differences in inflammatory makers on admission, including lactate dehydrogenase and ferritin, and peak creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) were noted between those with and without CLD (Table 1).\nIn the assessment of hospitalization course and outcomes, patients with CLD had higher rates of ICU stay (49.3% vs 35.0%, P = .028), need for mechanical ventilation (47.8% vs 30.3%, P = .0055) and in-hospital, all-cause mortality (23.9% vs 13.2%, P = .029). The mean length of stay was also longer among those with CLD compared to those without (13.4 +- 10.5 vs 10.1 +- 8.0, P = .038). Patients with cirrhosis had higher mortality than those without cirrhosis (55.6% vs 13.2%, P = .0004). On multivariable analyses controlling for age, gender, BMI, cardiac disease, hypertension, diabetes and pulmonary disorders, CLD remained an independent predictor for ICU admission (adjusted OR 1.77, 95% CI 1.03-3.04, P = .04) and for need for mechanical ventilation (adjusted OR 2.08, 95% CI 1.20-3.60, P = .0092), but not for death (adjusted OR 2.00, 95% CI 0.94-4.28, P = .07) (Table 2). When CLD was stratified into two groups (those with cirrhosis and those without cirrhosis), cirrhosis was an independent predictor for mortality on multivariable analysis (adjusted OR 12.5, 95% CI 2.16-72.5, P = .009) compared to patients without CLD, but not for mechanical ventilation or ICU admission. Non-cirrhosis CLD, on the other hand, was not associated with mortality (adjusted OR 1.47, 95% CI: 0.64-3.38, P = .13).\nMultivariate analyses for (A) the need for mechanical ventilation, (B) ICU admission and (C) death\nCovariates	Odds Ratio	95% Confidence Interval	P-value	 	(A) Multivariate regression models for need for mechanical ventilation	 	CLD vs no CLD	2.08	1.20-3.60	.0092	 	Age	1.01	0.99-1.03	.27	 	Obesity	1.23	0.77-1.98	.39	 	Male	1.59	0.99-2.56	.054	 	Cardiac diseases	0.64	0.34-1.19	.16	 	Hypertension	0.77	0.44-1.34	.35	 	Diabetes	1.39	0.84-2.33	.20	 	Hyperlipidaemia	1.08	0.66-1.76	.76	 	Pulmonary disorders	1.04	0.58-1.85	.90	 	(B) Multivariate regression models for ICU Admission	 	CLD vs no CLD	1.77	1.03-3.04	.04	 	Age	1.01	0.99-1.02	.57	 	Obesity	1.26	0.79-1.98	.33	 	Male	1.51	0.96-2.38	.08	 	Cardiac diseases	0.88	0.49-1.58	.66	 	Hypertension	0.93	0.55-1.60	.80	 	Diabetes	1.22	0.74-2.00	.44	 	Hyperlipidaemia	1.01	0.63-1.63	.96	 	Pulmonary disorders	0.88	0.50-1.54	.65	 	(C) Multivariate regression models for death	 	CLD vs no CLD	2.00	0.94-4.28	.07	 	Age	1.08	1.05-1.12	&lt;.0001	 	Obesity	1.03	0.51-2.09	.94	 	Male	1.62	0.80-3.26	.18	 	Cardiac diseases	0.98	0.46-2.09	.96	 	Hypertension	2.20	0.88-5.52	.09	 	Diabetes	1.38	0.68-2.79	.37	 	Hyperlipidaemia	0.91	0.46-1.81	.78	 	Pulmonary disorders	2.01	0.95-4.25	.07	 	\nAll the bold values highlight those with P &lt; .05.\nImpact of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease\nOn secondary analyses, we stratified CLD patients into those with NAFLD versus other aetiologies of CLD. The BMI was significantly higher among patients with NAFLD compared to those with non-NAFLD CLD (32.9 +- 6.9 vs 28.2 +- 4.9, P = .024). A significantly higher proportion of non-NAFLD CLD patients had cirrhosis compared to NAFLD patients (61.5% vs 1.8%, P &lt; .0001). On univariate analyses, when compared to patients without CLD, those with NAFLD had significantly higher rates of ICU admission (50.9% vs 35.2%, P = .0095) and need for mechanical ventilation (49.1% vs 30.4%, P = .006). On the other hand, there were no differences between patients with non-NAFLD CLD and those with no CLD in ICU admission (38.5% vs 33.7%, P = .81) and need for mechanical ventilation (38.5% vs 30.4%, P = .54). In-hospital mortality was significantly higher among patients with non-NAFLD CLD (53.9% vs 13.2%, P &lt; .0001) but not among NAFLD patients (16.4% vs 13.2%, P = .54), when compared to individuals without CLD. Notably, four of seven (57%) patients who died in the non-NAFLD CLD group had cirrhosis compared to one of nine (11%) patients who died in the NAFLD group.\nOn multivariate analyses controlling for age, gender, BMI, cardiac disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidaemia and pulmonary disorders, CLD as a result of NAFLD remained significantly associated with ICU admission (adjusted OR 2.30, 95% CI 1.27-4.17, P = .03) and with needing mechanical ventilation (adjusted OR 2.15, 95% CI 1.18-3.91, P = .02). Neither NAFLD nor non-NAFLD CLD was predictive for death on multivariate model.\nDISCUSSION\nIn this multicentre study of two tertiary and seven community hospitals in the Northeastern United States, we found that 19% of adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 had pre-existing CLD. This is higher than published reports thus far from China and the USA. In the largest study to date from China, only the prevalence of HBV (2.1%) was reported. The causes of 'liver disease' in another study, where CLD was present among 5% of patients, included NAFLD, HBV or alcohol-related. In the first recently published large case series of hospitalized patients in the USA, only a few patients had underlying liver disease (cirrhosis 0.4%, HBV 0.1%, HCV &lt; 0.1%). Other CLD including NAFLD was not reported, despite the high prevalence of metabolic comorbidities in the cohort. Considering the high prevalence of NAFLD in the USA and the mean BMI of 30.3 kg/m2 in our cohort, our prevalence rate of CLD may reflect a more accurate representation of the US population. Additionally, our systematically performed, manual review of each patient's prior medical records may have allowed us to better capture and ascertain the presence and type of CLD compared to some prior retrospective studies, which may have mostly relied on diagnosis codes and admission documentation in the electronic medical records. Notably, our robust chart review and data-gathering process allowed us to identify cases of fatty liver which may not have been captured through diagnosis codes or simple review of admission/discharge problem lists. Furthermore, another reason for the higher prevalence of baseline CLD observed in our study versus those of previously reported cohorts may be the relatively higher mean age of our study population.\nPatients with CLD had an increased prevalence of abnormal AST and ALT levels, as well as higher mean values of AST, ALT and alkaline phosphatase on admission. However, interestingly, peak AST and ALT values during hospitalization did not differ between patients with and without CLD, possibly due to a variety of factors. The first may be due to drug hepatotoxicity, as many patients received antiviral and anti-inflammatory medications against COVID-19 during hospitalization. Second, immune-mediated inflammation, cytokine release, ischemia and congestion related to positive pressure ventilation may also contribute to liver injury among critically ill patients. Additionally, underlying liver injury or inflammation may also result in a lower hepatic reserve and lower threshold for significant injury induced by direct viral effect, immune-mediated inflammation or medications.\nPatients with CLD had increased length of stay, higher rates of ICU stay and need for mechanical ventilation compared to those without CLD, even after controlling for comorbidities. Interestingly, this association was observed in patients with NAFLD but not among those with non-NAFLD CLD, although this may be potentially influenced by small sample size of the non-NAFLD CLD group. This difference might also, in part, be secondary to the association between NAFLD and obesity, as the mean BMI of NAFLD patients was significantly higher compared to that of non-NAFLD CLD patients. Prior studies have identified increased morbidity in patients with obesity in the ICU. There was also an observed higher rate of mechanical ventilation among severely obese hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in a recent US study. The pro-inflammatory state associated with obesity may contribute to the increased disease severity associated with COVID-19, with potentially higher risk for complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), as has previously been observed among non-COVID-19 populations. However, the increased rates of clinical severity among NAFLD patients were observed even after controlling for the presence of obesity, suggesting that the effect of NAFLD on disease severity may be due to more than increased BMI alone. A prior study found liver fat to be associated with higher serum markers of inflammation and oxidative stress. NAFLD has also been linked to reduction in lung function measured on pulmonary function test. These suggest possible pathways through which NAFLD may impact the clinical course of COVID-19, which often manifests with hypoxemic respiratory failure, progressive systemic inflammatory response and ARDS.\nWe found that compared to patients without CLD, those with cirrhosis had increased mortality, even after adjusting for other comorbidities. This relationship with mortality was not seen with non-cirrhotic CLD. On the other hand, mechanical ventilation and ICU admission were significantly associated with non-cirrhotic CLD, but not cirrhosis. The majority of patients with cirrhosis in our cohort had non-NAFLD CLD. These results may be explained by the observation that all patients with cirrhosis who required ICU care in our cohort died. This was substantially higher than the mortality rate (28%) among patients with non-cirrhosis CLD who required ICU admission, suggesting that presence of cirrhosis is associated with significant mortality among critically ill COVID-19 patients. More specifically, of the two patients with cirrhosis and HCC, one died of multi-organ failure and the other was discharged on home hospice. Our outcome results are compatible with those of a recent study analysing electronic medical records based on diagnosis codes of a large number of COVID-19 patients aged 10 years or older from healthcare centres across the USA. The prevalence of pre-existing liver disease in that cohort was 9% (cirrhosis 1.8%) and was associated with a significantly higher risk of mortality and hospitalizations especially among those with cirrhosis. \nOur study has several limitations. First is the retrospective design. Secondly, the diagnosis of CLD was determined based on prior evaluations such as imaging studies or histopathology. It is, therefore, possible that some patients with undiagnosed CLD may be misclassified. Second, our cohort focuses on hospitalized patients and precludes the evaluation of patients with perhaps milder courses of COVID-19, potentially over-estimating the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the liver. Finally, as this study includes data from multiple hospitals, the criteria for ICU admission and usage of mechanical ventilation may not be uniform. However, decisions for escalation to critical care are based mainly on clinician judgement, as there are no set guidelines at individual sites. In addition, as all nine hospitals belong to a single healthcare system, patients are often transferred between sites if ICU overcapacity at any individual site occurred, thereby decreasing potential influence of non-clinical factors in decisions of care. Despite the above limitations, this is one of the first and largest US studies to date to systematically evaluate the effect of underlying liver disease on manifestations and outcomes of COVID-19. Moreover, the CLD status was classified independently by two experienced liver specialists based on careful manual review of each patient's record, including all available imaging studies and histopathologic reports. Our study also included patients hospitalized in both tertiary medical centres and community settings, thereby improving the generalizability of our results.\nIn summary, in our cohort of hospitalized US adults with COVID-19, approximately one in five patients had underlying CLD, of whom 13% had confirmed cirrhosis. While patients with NAFLD were more likely to be admitted to the ICU and require mechanical ventilation, only those with cirrhosis, which were mostly secondary to non-NAFLD CLD in our cohort, had an increased risk of mortality. Further research is needed to better understand the effect of underlying CLD, specifically NAFLD, on the severity of COVID-19 and identify interventions to improve patient outcomes.\nCONFLICTS OF INTEREST\nNikroo Hashemi has no conflicts to disclose.

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in

SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

COVID-19","abstract":"Seventeen years after the epidemic of SARS coronavirus, a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2-emerged resulting in an unprecedented pandemic.\n Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an essential receptor for cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 as well as the SARS coronavirus.\n Despite many similarities to SARS coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 exhibits a higher affinity to ACE2 and shows higher infectivity and transmissibility, resulting in explosive increase of infected people and COVID-19 patients.\n Emergence of the variants harboring mutations in the receptor-binding domain of the Spike protein has drawn critical attention to the interaction between ACE2 and Spike and the efficacies of vaccines and neutralizing antibodies.\n ACE2 is a carboxypeptidase which degrades angiotensin II, B1-bradykinin, or apelin, and thereby is a critical regulator of cardiovascular physiology and pathology.\n In addition, the enzymatic activity of ACE2 is protective against acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by viral and non-viral pneumonias, aspiration, or sepsis.\n Upon infection, both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS coronaviruses downregulates ACE2 expression, likely associated with the pathogenesis of ARDS.\n Thus, ACE2 is not only the SARS-CoV-2 receptor but might also play an important role in multiple aspects of COVID-19 pathogenesis and possibly post-COVID-19 syndromes.\n Soluble forms of recombinant ACE2 are currently utilized as a pan-variant decoy to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 and a supplementation of ACE2 carboxypeptidase activity.\n Here, we review the role of ACE2 in the pathology of ARDS in COVID-19 and the potential application of recombinant ACE2 protein for treating COVID-19.","id":"PMC8727358","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Frontiers Media

cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) in SARS-CoV-2-mediated cardiorenal damage.\n\n\nMethods and Results\nThe published RNA-sequencing datasets of cardiomyocytes infected with SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 patients were used.\n\n String, UMAP plots and single cell RNA sequencing data were analyzed to show the close relationship and distinct cardiorenal distribution patterns of ACE2, apelin and SGLT2. Intriguingly, there were decreases in ACE2 and apelin expression as well as marked increases in SGLT2 and endothelin-1 levels in SARS-CoV-2-infected cardiomyocytes, animal models with diabetes, acute kidney injury, heart failure and COVID-19 patients.\n\n These changes were linked with downregulated levels of interleukin (IL)-10, superoxide dismutase 2 and catalase as well as upregulated expression of profibrotic genes and pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines.\n\n Genetic ACE2 deletion resulted in upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines containing IL-1?, IL-6, IL-17 and tumor

implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent

Our decade-long structural studies on the receptor recognition by SARS-CoV have identified key interactions between SARS-CoV spike protein and its host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which regulate both the cross-species and human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV.\n One of the goals of SARS-CoV research was to build an atomic-level iterative framework of virus-receptor

coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) strains.\n The molecular mechanisms regulating emerging coronavirus pathogenesis are complex and include virus–host interactions associated with entry, replication, egress and innate immune control.\n Epigenetics research investigates the genetic and non-genetic factors that regulate phenotypic variation, usually caused by external and environmental factors that alter host expression patterns and performance without any change in the underlying genotype.\n Epigenetic modifications, such as histone modifications, DNA methylation, chromatin remodeling, and non-coding RNAs, function as important regulators that remodel host chromatin, altering host expression patterns and networks in a highly flexible manner.\n For most of the past two and a half decades, research has focused on the molecular mechanisms by which RNA viruses antagonize the signaling and sensing components that regulate induction of the host innate immune and antiviral defense programs upon infection.\n More recently, a growing body of evidence supports the hypothesis that viruses, even lytic RNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm, have developed intricate, highly evolved, and well-coordinated processes that are designed to regulate the host epigenome, and control host innate immune antiviral defense processes, thereby promoting robust virus replication and pathogenesis.\n In this article, we discuss the strategies that are used to evaluate the mechanisms by which viruses regulate the host epigenome, especially focusing on highly pathogenic respiratory RNA virus infections as a model.\n By combining measures of epigenome reorganization with RNA and proteomic datasets, we articulate a spatial-temporal data integration approach to identify regulatory genomic clusters and regions that play a crucial role in the host’s innate immune response, thereby defining a new viral antagonism

consequences of cytokine storm and immunopathology","abstract":"id='Par1'>Human coronaviruses (hCoVs) can be divided into low pathogenic and highly pathogenic coronaviruses.\n The low pathogenic CoVs infect the upper respiratory tract and cause mild, cold-like respiratory illness.\n In contrast, highly pathogenic hCoVs such as severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) predominantly infect lower airways and cause fatal pneumonia.\n Severe pneumonia caused by pathogenic hCoVs is often associated with rapid virus replication, massive inflammatory cell infiltration and elevated pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine responses resulting in acute lung injury (ALI), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\n Recent studies in experimentally infected animal strongly suggest a crucial role for virus-induced immunopathological events in causing fatal pneumonia after hCoV infections.\n Here we review the current understanding of how a dysregulated immune response may cause lung immunopathology leading to deleterious clinical manifestations after pathogenic hCoV

coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.\n\n Increasing quartile of NLR was statistically significantly associated with secondary outcome.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR is associated with outcomes in unselected critically ill patients.\n\n In patients with sepsis, there was no statistically significant relationship between NLR and mortality.\n\n Further investigation is required to increase understanding of the pathophysiology of this relationship and to validate these findings with data collected prospectively.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article

a major threat to public health1–3.\n Despite intense research efforts, how, when and where new diseases appear are still a source of considerable uncertainty.\n A severe respiratory disease was recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China5.\n This outbreak highlights the ongoing ability of viral spill-over from animals to cause

The primary predictor was HS. The primary outcomes were severity of cardiopulmonary disease, transaminitis, jaundice, and portal hypertensive complications.\nResults\nIn a cohort of 342 patients, metabolic disease was highly prevalent including nearly 90% overweight. HS was associated with increased transaminitis and need for intubation, dialysis, and vasopressors. There was no association between HS and jaundice or portal hypertensive complications. In a sensitivity analysis including only patients with liver imaging &gt; 30 days before onset of COVID-19, imaging evidence of hepatic steatosis remained associated with disease severity and risk of transaminitis.\nConclusions\nHS was associated with increased disease severity and transaminitis in COVID-19. HS may be relevant in predicting risk of complications related to COVID-19.\nIntroduction\nCoronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic responsible for &gt; 25 million cases and &gt; 800,000 deaths worldwide. COVID-19 frequently results in gastrointestinal disease including liver injury. However, whether underlying liver disease influences COVID-19-related disease severity:both severity of respiratory disease and clinically meaningful liver-related outcomes such as jaundice, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy:is less clear. This question is critical because metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease, characterized by hepatic steatosis (HS) and metabolic risk factors including overweight, affects up to 30% of the population. Further, metabolic risk factors are strongly associated with increased COVID-19 disease severity. However, the impact of HS on COVID-19-related outcomes is not well understood and has not been reported to our knowledge in the USA. We aimed to evaluate the impact of HS on disease severity and liver injury in COVID-19.\nMethods\nThis was a retrospective single-center cohort study. Our study included hospitalized adult patients (&gt;= 18 years old) at Michigan Medicine with COVID-19 diagnosed by polymerase chain reaction between March 10, 2020 (first identified case in the state of Michigan) and May 20, 2020. Patients were followed until death, discharge from the hospital, or September 3, 2020. This study was approved by the University of Michigan Institutional Review Board.\nOutcomes were disease severity and liver injury. Disease severity was defined as: death, need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission, intubation, vasopressor requirement, new dialysis requirement, or the World Health Organization (WHO) ordinal scale. Liver injury was defined as peak alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt; 2X or 5X the upper limit of normal (ULN) and &gt; 2X or 5X the patient's prior baseline ALT (if known); jaundice (total bilirubin &gt; 2 mg/dL or 4 mg/dL); or new/worsening ascites or encephalopathy. ALT ULN was defined as 19 U/L for women and 30 U/L for men.\nThe primary predictor was HS, defined by either imaging evidence of steatosis &gt; 30 days before COVID-19 diagnosis, or hepatic steatosis index (HSI) &gt; 36 for Asians and &gt; 39 for non-Asians, based on ambulatory laboratory values &gt; 30 days before COVID-19 diagnosis. HSI was defined as 8 * ALT/aspartate aminotransferase (AST) + body mass index (BMI) + 2 (if diabetes) + 2 (if female).\nContinuous variables were represented as median (interquartile range [IQR]) and categorical variables as percentages. Continuous variables were compared using rank-sum tests and categorical variables using chi2 tests. Statistical significance was defined as two-tailed P value &lt; 0.05. We used logistic regressions with disease severity/liver injury as dependent variables (except WHO ordinal scale for which linear regression was used) and HS as the main independent variable. The multivariable model was adjusted for age, sex, race, recent healthcare exposure (hospitalization or nursing facility residence &lt; 90 days before COVID-19 diagnosis), hypertension, and dyslipidemia.\nAll statistical analyses were performed using R version 3.6.1 (Vienna, Austria).\nResults\nStudy flowchart\nClinical characteristics based on hepatic steatosis status\nCharacteristic	Overall (N = 342)	No hepatic steatosis (n = 164)	Hepatic steatosis (n = 178)	P value	 	Demographics	 	 Age	63.0 (52.0-73.0)	66.5 (54.0-79.2)	58.5 (49.0-67.0)	&lt; 0.001	 	 % male	53.5%	57.3%	50.0%	0.19	 	Race (n = 338)				&lt; 0.001	 	 White	44.7%	54.9%	35.1%		 	 Black	44.4%	35.4%	52.9%		 	 Other	10.9%	9.8%	12.1%		 	Comorbidities	 	 Body mass index (n = 337)	30.0 (25.9-36.0)	26.6 (24.8-29.2)	34.7 (30.3-40.7)	&lt; 0.001	 	 Hypertension (n = 341)	69.2%	67.7%	70.6%	0.56	 	 Dyslipidemia (n = 340)	47.0%	47.6%	46.6%	0.91	 	 Diabetes	43.3%	37.8%	48.3%	0.06	 	Baseline laboratory values	 	 Creatinine (mg/dL) (n = 325)	1.0 (0.8-1.3)	1.0 (0.8-1.5)	1.0 (0.8-1.2)	0.11	 	 ALT (U/L) (n = 326)	21.0 (15.0-30.0)	19.0 (14.0-28.0)	23.0 (16.5-33.0)	&lt; 0.001	 	 Total bilirubin (mg/dL) (n = 322)	0.5 (0.4-0.7)	0.5 (0.4-0.7)	0.5 (0.4-0.7)	0.80	 	 Hemoglobin A1c (%) (n = 242)	6.2 (5.7-7.3)	6.0 (5.6-6.8)	6.3 (5.8-7.6)	0.01	 	 High-density lipoprotein (mg/dL) (n = 251)	46.0 (38.0-56.0)	46.0 (37.0-56.0)	45.0 (38.2-55.8)	0.70	 	 Low-density lipoprotein (mg/dL) (n = 247)	91.0 (68.0-120.5)	88.0 (64.0-114.0)	92.5 (72.0-125.0)	0.11	 	 Triglycerides (mg/dL) (n = 251)	124.0 (85.5-178.0)	121.5 (86.2-172.2)	125.0 (85.0-184.0)	0.79	 	Peak laboratory values	 	 Creatinine (mg/dL) (n = 340)	1.3 (0.9-2.9)	1.3 (0.9-2.7)	1.2 (0.9-3.2)	0.85	 	 Alanine aminotransferase (U/L) (n = 331)	50.0 (31.0-96.5)	41.0 (26.2-75.0)	59.0 (36.0-114.0)	&lt; 0.001	 	 Total bilirubin (mg/dL) (n = 331)	0.7 (0.5-1.0)	0.6 (0.4-1.0)	0.8 (0.5-1.0)	0.02	 	Disease severity	 	 Death	18.7%	22.6%	15.2%	0.01	 	 Intensive care unit	54.1%	51.2%	56.7%	0.33	 	 Intubation	34.5%	25.0%	43.3%	&lt; 0.001	 	 Dialysis	12.0%	8.0%	15.7%	0.03	 	 Vasopressors	24.0%	14.7%	32.6%	&lt; 0.001	 	 ALT &gt; 2x ULN	45.3%	39.2%	50.9%	0.04	 	 ALT &gt; 5x ULN	13.6%	8.2%	18.5%	0.007	 	 Bilirubin &gt; 2 mg/dL	8.8%	8.9%	8.7%	1	 	 Bilirubin &gt; 4 mg/dL	2.1%	3.2%	1.2%	0.27	 	 World Health Organization ordinal scale	4.0 (4.0-7.0)	4.0 (3.0-7.0)	5.0 (4.0-7.0)	0.34	 	Treatment	 	 Any treatment	57.9%	54.3%	61.2%	0.23	 	 Hydroxychloroquine	34.8%	32.9%	36.6%	0.49	 	 Remdesivir	5.2%	5.7%	4.7%	0.80	 	 Tocilizumab	16.7%	10.8%	22.1%	0.01	 	 Corticosteroids	13.6%	10.8%	16.3%	0.15	 	 Sarilumab (blinded trial)	5.0%	4.9%	5.1%	1.00	 	 Donor plasma	0.6%	0.6%	0.6%	1.00	 	\nALT alanine aminotransferase, ULN upper limit of normal, defined as the greater of the patient's prior baseline (if known), 19 U/L for women, or 30 U/L for men\nThe cohort included 342 patients, of whom 178 (52%) had HS based on imaging or HSI (Fig. 1).

In unadjusted analyses, patients with HS more often required intubation, dialysis, or vasopressors and had greater odds of transaminitis, but were less likely to die (Tables 1, 2, Fig. 2). There was no difference by HS status in ICU admission or jaundice. In multivariable analyses, HS was associated with increased odds of ICU admission (odds ratio 1.60 [95% confidence interval 1.00-2.57]), intubation (2.51 [1.52-4.16]), vasopressor requirement (1.22 [1.11-1.34]), and ALT &gt; 5x ULN (2.12 [1.03-4.37]). Patients with HS had more severe disease based on higher WHO ordinal scale (Table 2). Rates of new/worsening ascites and encephalopathy were low: 1.3% and 2.5%, respectively, with no difference based on HS status (P &gt; 0.4). \nPredictors of disease severity and liver injury based on hepatic steatosis as defined by imaging alone\n	Univariable	Multivariablea	 	Logistic regressions	 	 Outcome	Odds ratio	P value	Odds ratio	P value	 	 Death	0.65 (0.29, 1.49)	0.31	0.83 (0.31, 2.20)	0.71	 	 Intensive care unit admission	1.26 (0.64, 2.47)	0.50	1.68 (0.76, 3.71)	0.20	 	 Intubation	2.53 (1.25, 5.12)	0.01	2.75 (1.21, 6.25)	0.02	 	 Dialysis	1.54 (0.58, 4.11)	0.38	1.89 (0.61, 5.86)	0.27	 	 Vasopressor use	2.83 (1.25, 6.40)	0.01	1.22 (1.04, 1.43)	0.02	 	 ALT &gt; 2x ULN	2.28 (1.14, 4.55)	0.02	3.36 (1.43, 7.87)	0.01	 	 ALT &gt; 5x ULN	7.11 (1.97, 25.71)	0.003	7.09 (1.73, 28.95)	0.01	 	 Bilirubin &gt; 2 mg/dL	1.79 (0.55, 5.77)	0.33	2.40 (0.61, 9.49)	0.21	 	 Bilirubin &gt; 4 mg/dL	0.52 (0.05, 5.90)	0.60	3.63 (0.12, 109.38)	0.46	 	Linear regression	 	 Outcome	Beta	P value	Beta	P value	 	 WHO ordinal scale	0.28 (- 0.35, 0.91)	0.38	0.49 (- 0.23, 1.21)	0.18	 	\nBold values indicate statistically-significant association\nALT alanine aminotransferase, ICU intensive care unit, ULN upper limit of normal, defined as the greater of the patient's prior baseline (if known), 19 U/L for women, or 30 U/L for men, WHO World Health Organization\naAdjusted for age, sex, race (white, black, or other), recent healthcare exposure (hospitalization or residence at an extended care facility or skilled nursing facility &lt; 90 days before COVID-19 diagnosis), presence of hypertension, and presence of dyslipidemia\nWe conducted sensitivity analyses where only patients with imaging evidence of hepatic steatosis &gt; 30 days prior to COVID-19 diagnosis. Of 141 patients with prior imaging, 68 (48%) had HS. Imaging evidence of HS was associated with increased adjusted odds of intubation (2.75 [1.21-6.25]), vasopressor requirements (1.22 [1.04-1.43]), and odds of ALT &gt; 5x ULN (7.09 [1.73-28.95]) (Table 3). There was no difference by HS status in ICU admission, death, jaundice, dialysis requirement, or WHO ordinal scale.\nDiscussion\nWe found that in a US cohort of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, HS was associated with increased disease severity and transaminitis, but not with clinically relevant liver complications such as jaundice or new/worsening ascites or hepatic encephalopathy.\nOur study adds to a literature on the effects of HS, and chronic liver disease more generally, on COVID-19 severity. Two studies found that HS based on imaging or HSI was associated with increased transaminitis and more severe respiratory disease, while in a third it was only patients with HS and advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis who suffered poorer outcomes, not those with HS without fibrosis. Notably, all these studies were in cohorts from China, with far lower rates of underlying obesity, diabetes, and other comorbidities than in our cohort. In addition to HS, chronic liver disease generally has also been associated with increased disease severity in COVID-19. We were unable to evaluate the effect of non-HS chronic liver disease on disease severity as prevalence was low in this cohort.\nTransaminitis with ALT &gt; 2x ULN was common in our cohort, and higher in individuals with HS even accounting for baseline ALT. However, severe liver complications such as jaundice, ascites, and encephalopathy were uncommon and unaffected by the presence of HS. This finding is consistent with other literature on high frequency of transaminitis in COVID-19:which is also associated with poorer outcomes severity:but low rates of jaundice. International studies have found that among patients with underlying chronic liver disease with or without cirrhosis, acute liver injury on presentation was &gt; 30%. As our population had a low prevalence of cirrhosis (2%), we lacked power to identify such a trend. However, the low rates of decompensation in a real-world cohort of hospitalized patients not otherwise enriched for liver disease, over half of whom required ICU admission, suggest that in COVID-19 liver disease likely reflects underlying sepsis and is not a primary driver of morbidity.\nLimitations of this study include use of a surrogate measure of HS. We addressed this with a sensitivity analysis including only patients with prior imaging and found that HS prevalence based on imaging or HSI was not substantially higher than based on imaging alone. While prevalence of HS was higher than that of the general population in this cohort, this high prevalence likely reflects the metabolic comorbidities including diabetes and obesity among this study population. Strengths include that this is one of the first studies of its kind in the USA and we utilized robust classification through chart review.\nIn conclusion, the presence of HS is associated with more severe COVID-19 respiratory disease. Liver-related complications were low and had no association with HS.\nAbbreviations\nALT\nAlanine aminotransferase\nAST\nAspartate aminotransferase\nBMI\nBody mass index\nCOVID-19\nCoronavirus disease-2019\nHS\nHepatic steatosis\nHSI\nHepatic steatosis index\nIQR\nInterquartile range\nULN\nUpper limit of normal\nWHO\nWorld Health Organization\nPublisher's Note\nSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.\nAuthor's contributions\nDr. PS and VC are the guarantors of the article and developed the concept, contributed to study design, data analysis, and interpretation, and drafted the manuscript.

All patients were confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction and were analyzed for clinical characteristics, laboratory data, and treatment.\n\n Data were followed up until March 18, 2020.\nRESULTS:\nIn the present study, 204 patients with COVID-19 and full laboratory, imaging, and historical data were analyzed.\n\n The average age was 52.9 years (SD ± 16), including 107 men and 97 women.\n\n Although most patients presented to the hospital with fever or respiratory symptoms, we found that 103 patients (50.5%) reported a digestive symptom, including lack of appetite (81 [78.6%] cases), diarrhea (35 [34%] cases), vomiting (4 [3.9%] cases), and abdominal pain (2 [1.9%] cases).\n\n If lack of appetite is excluded from the analysis (because it is less specific for the gastrointestinal tract), there were 38 total cases (18.6%) where patients presented with a gastrointestinal-specific symptom, including diarrhea, vomiting, or abdominal pain.\n\n Patients with digestive symptoms had a significantly longer time from onset to admission than patients without digestive symptoms (9.0 days vs 7.3 days).\n\n In 6 cases, there were digestive symptoms, but no respiratory symptoms.\n\n As the severity of the disease increased, digestive symptoms became more pronounced.\n\n Patients with digestive symptoms had higher mean liver enzyme levels, lower monocyte count, longer prothrombin time, and received more antimicrobial treatment than those without digestive symptoms.\n\n\nDISCUSSION:\nWe found that digestive symptoms are common in patients with COVID-19. Moreover, these patients have a longer time from onset to admission, evidence of longer coagulation, and higher liver enzyme levels.\n\n Clinicians should recognize that digestive symptoms, such as diarrhea, are commonly among the presenting features of COVID-19 and that the index of suspicion may need to be raised earlier in at-risk patients presenting with digestive symptoms.\n\n However, further large sample studies are needed to confirm these findings.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7172492","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Wolters

Anthropometric, clinical, and laboratory data were examined during regular health check-ups and fatty liver diagnosed by abdominal ultrasound.\n\n Logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine predictors of prevalent NAFLD and to derive risk scores/models.\n\n We validated our models and compared them with other existing methods using an external cohort (N?=?66868).\n\n\nResults\nThe simple self-assessment score consists of age, sex, waist circumference, body mass index, history of diabetes and dyslipidemia, alcohol intake, physical activity and menopause status, which are independently associated with NAFLD, and has a value of 0–15. A cut-off point of ?8 defined 58% of males and 36% of females as being at high-risk of NAFLD, and yielded a sensitivity of 80% in men (77% in women), a specificity of 67% (81%), a positive predictive value of 72% (63%), a negative predictive value of 76% (89%) and an AUC of 0.82 (0.88).\n\n Comparable results were obtained using the validation dataset.\n\n The comprehensive NAFLD score, which includes additional laboratory parameters, has enhanced discrimination ability, with an AUC of 0.86 for males and 0.91 for females.\n\n Both simple and comprehensive NAFLD scores were significantly increased in subjects with higher fatty liver grades or severity of liver conditions (e.\n\ng.\n\n, simple steatosis, steatohepatitis).\n\n\nConclusions\nThe new non–laboratory-based self-assessment score may be useful for identifying individuals at high-risk of NAFLD.\n\n Further studies are warranted to evaluate the utility and feasibility of the scores in various

(7/148).\n\n Common symptoms of older patients with COVID-19 included fever (94.5%; n=52), dry cough (69.1%; n=38), and chest distress (63.6%; n=35).\n\n Compared with young patients, older patients had more laboratory abnormalities and comorbidities.\n\n Through a multivariate analysis of the causes of death in older patients, we found that males, comorbidities, time from disease onset to hospitalization, abnormal kidney function, and elevated procalcitonin levels were all significantly associated with death.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn the recent outbreak of COVID-19, our local hospital in Wuhan found that patients aged 65 and older had greater initial comorbidities, more severe symptoms, and were more likely to experience multi-organ involvement and death, as compared with younger patients.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7184388","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Oxford University

Factors of Fatal Outcome in Hospitalized Subjects With Coronavirus Disease 2019 From a Nationwide Analysis in China","abstract":"Background\nThe novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global health emergency.\n\n The cumulative number of new confirmed cases and deaths are still increasing out of China.\n\n Independent predicted factors associated with fatal outcomes remain uncertain.\n\n\nResearch Question\nThe goal of the current study was to investigate the potential risk factors associated with fatal outcomes from COVID-19 through a multivariate Cox regression analysis and a nomogram model.\n\n\nStudy Design and Methods\nA retrospective cohort of 1,590 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 throughout China was established.\n\n The prognostic effects of variables, including clinical features and laboratory findings, were analyzed by using Kaplan-Meier methods and a Cox proportional hazards model.\n\n A prognostic nomogram was formulated to predict the survival of patients with COVID-19.\nResults\nIn this nationwide cohort, nonsurvivors included a higher incidence of elderly people and subjects with coexisting chronic illness, dyspnea, and laboratory abnormalities on admission compared with survivors.\n\n Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that age ? 75 years (hazard ratio [HR], 7.86; 95% CI, 2.44-25.35), age between 65 and 74 years (HR, 3.43; 95% CI, 1.24-9.5), coronary heart disease (HR, 4.28; 95% CI, 1.14-16.13), cerebrovascular disease (HR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.07-8.94), dyspnea (HR, 3.96; 95% CI, 1.42-11), procalcitonin level &gt; 0.5 ng/mL (HR, 8.72; 95% CI, 3.42-22.28), and aspartate aminotransferase level &gt; 40 U/L (HR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.1-6.73) were independent risk factors associated with fatal outcome.\n\n A nomogram was established based on the results of multivariate analysis.\n\n The internal bootstrap resampling approach suggested the nomogram has sufficient discriminatory power with a C-index of 0.91 (95% CI, 0.85-0.97).\n\n The calibration plots also showed good consistency between the prediction and the observation.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe proposed nomogram accurately predicted clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19 based on individual characteristics.\n\n Earlier identification, more intensive surveillance, and appropriate therapy should be considered in patients at high risk.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7158802","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"American College of Chest Physicians.

Clinical Status in Human Cirrhosis and Corrects Post Liver Transplantation","abstract":"Introduction: Recent animal studies have shown that the alternate renin-angiotensin system (RAS) consisting of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), angiotensin-(1–7) (Ang-(1–7)) and the Mas receptor is upregulated in cirrhosis and contributes to splanchnic vasodilatation and portal hypertension.\n To determine the potential relevance of these findings to human liver disease, we evaluated its expression and relationship to the patients’ clinical status in subjects with cirrhosis.\n Methods: Blood sampling from peripheral and central vascular beds was performed intra-operatively for cirrhotic patients at the time of liver transplantation (LT) or trans-jugular intra-hepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedures to measure angiotensin II (Ang II) and Ang-(1–7) peptide levels and ACE and ACE2 enzyme activity.\n Relevant clinical and hemodynamic data were recorded pre-operatively for all subjects and peripheral blood sampling was repeated 3 months or later post-operatively.\n Results: Ang-(1–-7) and ACE2 activity were up-regulated more than twofold in cirrhotic subjects both at the time of LT and TIPS and levels returned to comparable levels as control subjects post-transplantation.\n Ang-(1–7) levels correlated positively with the degree of liver disease severity, as measured by the model for an end-stage liver disease (MELD) and also with clinical parameters of pathological vasodilatation including cardiac output (CO).\n There were strong correlations found between the ACE2:ACE and the Ang-(1–7):Ang II ratio highlighting the inter-dependence of the alternate and classical arms of the RAS and thus their potential impact on vascular tone.\n Conclusions: In human cirrhosis, the alternate RAS is markedly upregulated and the activation of this system is associated strongly with features of the hyperdynamic circulation in advanced human cirrhosis.\n","id":"PMC6518205","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"Stephen","surname":"Casey","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Robert","surname":"Schierwagen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kai

Liver impairment has been frequently reported as a common manifestation, although its clinical significance is still unclear, particularly in patients with underlying chronic liver disease (CLD).\n\n\nAims\nTo summarise the changes in liver function tests during SARS?CoV?2 infection and the impact of COVID?19 in patients with underlying CLD.\n\n\nMethods\nA literature review using online database PubMed was done using the search terms “SARS?CoV?2”, “COVID?19”, “liver”, “cirrhosis” and “liver transplantation”.\n\n\nResults\nCOVID?19 is frequently associated with different degrees of abnormal liver function tests, most notably transaminases, which are usually transitory and of mild degree.\n\n Available evidence suggests that liver injury may result from direct pathogenic effect by the virus, systemic inflammation or toxicity from commonly used drugs in this subset of patients.\n\n SARS?CoV?2 infection in children is associated with minimal or no increase in liver enzymes, thus the presence of abnormal liver function tests should trigger evaluation for underlying liver diseases.\n\n Although it seems that patients with CLD are not at greater risk for acquiring the infection, those with cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, non?alcoholic fatty liver disease, autoimmune liver diseases or liver transplant may have a greater risk for severe COVID?19.\nConclusions\nAbnormal liver function tests during the course of COVID?19 are common, though clinically significant liver injury is rare.\n\n Further research is needed focusing on the

2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and Prevention of Infectious Disease in China, Chinese Academy of

Treatments for metabolic disease mitigated risks from NAFLD/NASH. More research is needed to confirm risk associated with visceral adiposity, and patients should be screened for and informed of treatments for metabolic syndrome.\nBackground:\nHospitalizations for Covid-19 disease continue to disrupt thousands of lives. Obesity and metabolic disease appear to be the most significant modifiable risk factors for poor outcomes from Covid-19. Hepatic steatosis (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, NAFLD, and non-alcohol steatohepatitis [NASH]) is evidence of visceral adiposity, advanced metabolic disease, and overt inflammation. Given Covid-19's pathophysiology through inflammation, NAFLD/NASH may put patients at even higher risk of poor outcomes from Covid-19. Few papers have fully assessed risk for poor outcomes from Covid-19 associated with NAFLD/NASH, and factors that might reduce that risk.\nWe conducted a retrospective analysis of individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection and their likelihood of being admitted for Covid-19 with the following objectives: Our primary objective was to quantify the risk for hospitalization for Covid-19 based on a history of NAFLD/NASH. Our secondary objective was to assess whether known treatments for metabolic disease modified risk associated with NAFLD/NASH. Third, we were interested in whether NAFLD/NASH was associated with severe Covid-19 (intubation, mortality). Lastly, because visceral adiposity accumulates at a lower body mass index (BMI) level in men and is more prevalent among certain ethnic groups, we assessed interactions between gender and race/ethnicity and NAFLD/NASH as drivers of Covid-19 outcomes.\nMethods:\nDesign and data source\nRetrospective analysis of electronic medical record data from 12 hospitals and 56 primary care clinics.\nPopulation\nOver 6,700 adults with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR from March 1, 2020 to Aug 25, 2020. Inclusion criteria: patients who opted in to research. All ages included. Exclusion criteria: patients who opted out of research.\nIndependent Variable\nPersons with NAFLD/NASH were defined as those with ICD codes for NAFLD or NASH or a BMI &gt;= 30kg/m2 and an elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) on 3 separate dates. This definition was used rather than ICD coding because NASH and NAFLD are significantly underdiagnosed in the EHR.\nDependent Variable of Interest:\nAn admission to the hospital for Covid-19 disease. Secondary outcomes were assessed for mortality, and admission to the intensive care unit (ICU).\nAnalyses:\nLogistic regression and competing risk were used to assess odds of being hospitalized. Adjustments were made for known confounders selected by Lasso-logit to reduce the likelihood of over-fitting. Additional adjustment was added to assess risk of hospitalization among patients with a prescription for metformin use with in the 3 months prior to the SARS-CoV-2 PCR result, history of home glucagon-like-peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) use, and history of metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS). Interactions were assessed by gender and race, and subgroup analyses were subsequently conducted. In order to account for variables that can worsen NAFLD/NASH, sensitivity analysis was done excluding patients with a history of alcohol use disorder, home amiodarone or methotrexate use. Multiple imputation was used for variables with missingness over 10%. Logistic Goodness of fit was assessed using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test (p=1.00) and area under the curve (0.86) for the model pre-imputation. E-values were calculated. Statistical analyses were performed using Stata MP, version 16 (StataCorp, College Station, TX). The University of MN IRB approved this study.\nResults:\nCharacteristics of the Cohort\nThe median age was 46, (IQR 28 to 66), 44% female, and 373 (5.5%) persons had NAFLD/NASH. Fifty three percent identified as White; 22% as Black; 12% as Asian; 8% as Hispanic; 4% Declined; and 1% as &quot;Other,&quot; Table 1.\nRisks associated with NAFLD/NASH\nA history of NAFLD/NASH was associated with increased odds of admission for Covid-19: logistic regression OR 2.04 (1.55, 2.96, p&lt;0.01), competing risks OR 1.43 (1.09-1.88, p&lt;0.01); and in the sensitivity analysis. Each additional year of having NAFLD/NASH was also associated with a significant increased risk of being hospitalized for Covid-19, OR 1.86 (1.43-2.42, p&lt;0.01). After controlling for NAFLD/NASH, persons with obesity had decreased odds of hospitalization for Covid-19, OR 0.41 (0.34-0.49, p&lt;0.01), Table 2, Figure 1.\nDemographic characteristics\nAfter controlling for NAFLD/NASH, men had increased odds of admission, 1.28 (1.08-1.51, p&lt;0.01). In subgroup analysis, NAFLD/NASH increased odds of admission in men: 2.48 (1.68-3.65, p&lt;0.01), and among women: OR 1.71 (1.17-2.49, p=0.01). After controlling for BMI and NAFLD/NASH, persons of color still had increased risk of admission over those identifying as White. NAFLD/NASH significantly increased risk of hospitalization within each racial subgroup, with the largest increase among persons who self-identified as Black, OR 2.69 (1.40-5.16, p&lt;0.01).\nMetabolic syndrome treatments\nPersons with NAFLD/NASH who had home metformin use in the 3-months prior to SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis (n=36), had a large decrease in odds of admission with near significance, OR 0.42 (0.18-1.01, p=0.05), as did those with home GLP-1RA use, n=22, OR 0.40 (0.14-1.17, p=0.10). Persons with NAFLD/NASH who had undergone bariatric surgery, n=16, had significantly decreased odds of admission for Covid-19, OR 0.22 (0.05-0.98, p&lt;0.05).\nDiscussion\nThis is the first in-depth assessment of NAFLD/NASH as a risk factor for admission for Covid-19 in a large database in the US, as well as possible treatments for mitigating this risk. We found that NAFLD/NASH was a more significant risk factor for admission than age, gender, obesity, or other comorbidities. This is the first analysis to describe that after controlling for NAFLD/NASH, there was no longer an increased risk of hospitalization with obesity. This may indicate the significant role of visceral adiposity in the pathophysiology of Covid-19, which amplifies the chronic state of inflammation and hypercoagulability created by NAFLD/NASH.\nNAFLD/NASH increased risk of hospitalization in both men and women. Assessing an interaction with race was done because of significant differences in outcomes in Covid-19 by race and ethnicity. NAFLD/NASH increased risk of hospitalization in all groups, but controlling for NAFLD/NASH did not eliminate differences in risk between racial/ethnic groups. Of note, persons who had self-identified as Black who had NAFLD/NASH compared to those who did not had the biggest increased odds of hospitalization. This may be due to lower amounts of visceral adiposity previously reported in Black individuals.\nPromisingly, we found that known treatments for metabolic syndrome and NAFLD/NASH greatly mitigated risks from Covid-19 -those with home metformin or GLP-1RA use had a non-significantly reduced odds of hospitalization, and those who had undergone bariatric surgery had a significant decrease in odds of hospitalization. CCB's were associated with a non-significant benefit in this analysis. Findings of protective effects from amiodarone and alcohol use may indicate 1) anticoagulant use given for the arrhythmia the amiodarone is used for, and 2) coagulopathy caused by chronic alcohol consumption.\nWhile the protective benefits of metformin, GLP-1RA, and bariatric surgery are promising, more therapies for NAFLD/NASH are urgently needed. The mainstay of treatment for NAFLD/NASH is weight loss, and while advances in obesity medicine have made achieving sustainable weight loss more possible, societal forces including the current Covid-19 pandemic, continue to create an obesogenic environment - over 42% of adults in the US now have obesity. Research assessing risk from visceral adiposity, such as from imaging studies, is needed.\nOur study has several limitations: there may be unmeasured confounders and residual bias. Findings in a sample in the upper Midwest may not be generalizable. Hepatitis B and C were not excluded as they may co-occur with NAFLD/NASH in persons with BMI&gt;=30kg/m2, and the prevalence in this region is low: 0.78% of adults with hepatitis C and 0.59% with chronic hepatitis B. Further selection bias may be present in that there are likely many more individuals in this population who have NAFLD/NASH but who did not have 3 elevated ALT readings.\nConclusions:\nNAFLD/NASH is a state of chronic inflammation due to visceral adiposity, is a significant risk factor for hospitalization for Covid-19, and appears to account for risk attributed to obesity. Treatments for metabolic disease mitigated risks from NAFLD/NASH. More research is needed to confirm these findings. Patients with elevated BMI should be screened for NAFLD/NASH and informed of the risks associated with visceral adiposity and Covid-19, as well as opportunities for mitigating this risk such as bariatric surgery, GLP-1RA, and metformin.\nSupplementary Material\nDisclosures: Dr. Tignanelli is PI on randomized trials for Covid-19, but not related to metformin.

(COVID-NET)","abstract":"Background\nCurrently, the United States has the largest number of reported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases and deaths globally.\n\n Using a geographically diverse surveillance network, we describe risk factors for severe outcomes among adults hospitalized with COVID-19.\nMethods\nWe analyzed data from 2,491 adults hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 during March 1–May 2, 2020 identified through the Coronavirus Disease 2019-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network comprising 154 acute care hospitals in 74 counties in 13 states.\n\n We used multivariable analyses to assess associations between age, sex, race and ethnicity, and underlying conditions with intensive care unit (ICU) admission and in-hospital mortality.\n\n\nResults\nNinety-two percent of patients had ?1 underlying condition; 32% required ICU admission; 19% invasive mechanical ventilation; and 17% died.\n\n Independent factors associated with ICU admission included ages 50-64, 65-74, 75-84 and ?85 years versus 18-39 years (adjusted risk ratio (aRR) 1.53, 1.65, 1.84 and 1.43, respectively); male sex (aRR 1.34); obesity (aRR 1.31); immunosuppression (aRR 1.29); and diabetes (aRR 1.13).\n\n Independent factors associated with in-hospital mortality included ages 50-64, 65-74, 75-84 and ?85 years versus 18-39 years (aRR 3.11, 5.77, 7.67 and 10.98, respectively); male sex (aRR 1.30); immunosuppression (aRR 1.39); renal disease (aRR 1.33); chronic lung disease (aRR 1.31); cardiovascular disease (aRR 1.28); neurologic disorders (aRR 1.25); and diabetes (aRR 1.19).\n\n\nConclusion\nIn-hospital mortality increased markedly with increasing age.\n\n Aggressive implementation of prevention strategies, including social distancing and rigorous hand hygiene, may benefit the population as a whole, as well as those at highest risk for COVID-19-related complications.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7454425","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Oxford University

in tissues and immune cells in health and in asthma, COPD, obesity, hypertension, and COVID?19 risk factors","abstract":"Background\nMorbidity and mortality from COVID?19 caused by novel coronavirus SARS?CoV?2 is accelerating worldwide, and novel clinical presentations of COVID?19 are often reported.\n\n The range of human cells and tissues targeted by SARS?CoV?2, its potential receptors and associated regulating factors are still largely unknown.\n\n The aim of our study was to analyze the expression of known and potential SARS?CoV?2 receptors and related molecules in the extensive collection of primary human cells and tissues from healthy subjects of different age and from patients with risk factors and known comorbidities of COVID?19.\nMethods\nWe performed RNA sequencing and explored available RNA?Seq databases to study gene expression and co?expression of ACE2, CD147 (BSG), and CD26 (DPP4) and their direct and indirect molecular partners in primary human bronchial epithelial cells, bronchial and skin biopsies, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, whole blood, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), monocytes, neutrophils, DCs, NK cells, ILC1, ILC2, ILC3, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, B cells, and plasmablasts.\n\n We analyzed the material from healthy children and adults, and from adults in relation to their disease or COVID?19 risk factor status.\n\n\nResults\n\nACE2 and TMPRSS2 were coexpressed at the epithelial sites of the lung and skin, whereas CD147 (BSG), cyclophilins (PPIA andPPIB), CD26 (DPP4), and related molecules were expressed in both epithelium and in immune cells.\n\n We also observed a distinct age?related expression profile of these genes in the PBMCs and T cells from healthy children and adults.\n\n Asthma, COPD, hypertension, smoking, obesity, and male gender status generally led to the higher expression of ACE2? and CD147?related genes in the bronchial biopsy, BAL, or blood.\n\n Additionally, CD147?related genes correlated positively with age and BMI.\n\n Interestingly, we also observed higher expression of CD147?related genes in the lesional skin of patients with atopic dermatitis.\n\n\nConclusions\nOur data suggest different receptor repertoire potentially involved in the SARS?CoV?2 infection at the epithelial barriers and in the immune cells.\n\n Altered expression of these receptors related to age, gender, obesity and smoking, as well as with the disease status, might contribute to COVID?19 morbidity and severity patterns.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7300910","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley and Sons

fatty liver disease\nDear Sir,\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared a pandemic in 2020. Preliminary data suggests that obesity may aggravate the severity of respiratory diseases and of COVID-19. Patients with metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), formerly known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, are often obese and have additional metabolic risk factors which may translate to a greater risk from respiratory diseases. It is currently not known whether MALFD patients are also more likely to have greater COVID-19 severity of illness. This study investigated the association between MAFLD and COVID-19 severity.\nWe consecutively enrolled 214 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 aged between 18 and 75 years from three hospitals in Wenzhou, China (the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou Central Hospital, and Ruian People's Hospital) between January 17, 2020 and February 11, 2020. All patients were screened for fatty liver by computed tomography and subsequently diagnosed as MAFLD according to a recent set of consensus diagnostic criteria. Sixty six COVID-19 patients with MAFLD were included in the analyses and were divided into two groups [those with obesity (n = 45) and those without (n = 21)]. All patients received standard treatment based on the COVID-19 Management Guidance (7th edition). This study was approved by the local ethics review boards of all three hospitals. The requirement for written informed consent was waived for use of the de-identified data.\nCOVID-19 was diagnosed as a positive result by high-throughput sequencing or real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay of oropharyngeal swab specimens. COVID-19 severity was assessed during hospitalization and classified as severe and non-severe based on the management guideline. Blood routine markers were analyzed at the central laboratory of respective hospital using standard methods by VITROS 5600 Integrated Immunodiagnostic System (VITROS 5600, Johnson, New Jersey, USA).\nWe collected demographic information and past medical history from all patients. Laboratory parameters were tested on the first day of hospital admission. Body weight and height were measured by trained examiners on admission. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated using the formula weight (kilograms) divided by height (meters) squared. Obesity was defined as BMI &gt;25 kg/m2. Diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia were diagnosed based on established criteria. All patients denied a history of chronic obstructive or restrictive pulmonary disease.\nContinuous variables are expressed as mean +- SD and compared using either the Student's t-test for normally distributed variables or the Mann-Whitney test for non-normally distributed variables. Continuous variables were tested for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Differences between categorical variables were examined with the chi-squared test or the Fisher's exact test as appropriate. The association between obesity (as exposure) and COVID-19 severity (as the outcome) among MAFLD patients was assessed by binary logistic regression. Statistical analyses were two-sided and significance was set at p &lt; 0.05. All statistical tests were performed using SPSS version 23.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA).\nBaseline characteristics of MAFLD patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 according to obesity status.\nTable 1	 	\n	OverallN = 66	Without obesityN = 21	With obesityN = 45	P value	 	Demographics					 	 Age, years					 	 18-44 yrs, n (%)	39 (59.1%)	15 (71.43%)	24 (53.33%)	0.207	 	 45-64 yrs, n (%)	22 (33.3%)	6 (28.57%)	16 (35.56%)		 	 &gt;=65 yrs, n (%)	5 (7.6%)	0 (0.00%)	5 (11.11%)		 	 Female sex, n (%)	17 (25.8%)	4 (19.05%)	13 (28.89%)	0.548	 	 Body mass index, kg/m2	26.5 +- 3.9	22.7 +- 2.1	28.3 +- 3.2	&lt;0.001	 	Coexisting disorders					 	 Current smoker, n (%)	8 (12.1%)	2 (9.5%)	6 (13.3%)	0.659	 	 Type 2 diabetes, n (%)	16 (24.2%)	2 (9.5%)	14 (31.1%)	0.070	 	 Hypertension, n (%)	19 (28.8%)	3 (14.3%)	16 (35.6%)	0.089	 	 Dyslipidemia, n (%)	45 (68.2%)	14 (66.67%)	31 (68.89%)	0.857	 	Laboratory parameters					 	 White blood cell count, x109	4.9 (3.9-6.7)	4.8 (3.8-6.3)	5.0 (4.1-6.7)	0.495	 	 &gt;10 x 109, n (%)	2 (3.0%)	0 (0.0%)	2 (4.4%)	0.511	 	 &lt;4 x 109, n (%)	17 (25.8%)	7 (33.3%)	10 (22.2%)		 	 Lymphocyte count, x109	1.2 (0.9-1.6)	1.4 (1.1-1.8)	1.1 (0.9-1.4)	0.040	 	 &lt;1.5 x 109, n (%)	47 (71.2%)	11 (52.4%)	36 (80.0%)	0.021	 	 C-reactive protein, mg/L	21.6 (8.1-47.3)	18.3 (5.8-24.5)	25.3 (11.3-53.5)	0.097	 	 &gt;=10 mg/L, n (%)	47 (71.2%)	13 (61.9%)	34 (75.6%)	0.382	 	 Alanine aminotransferase, U/L	29.5 (24.0-62.5)	26.0 (20.0-45.0)	30.0 (24.0-65.0)	0.150	 	 &gt;40 U/L, n (%)	25 (37.9%)	6 (28.6%)	19 (42.2%)	0.415	 	 Aspartate aminotransferase, U/L	31.5 (23.0-47.0)	25.0 (21.0-33.0)	35.0 (27.0-52.0)	0.010	 	 &gt;40 U/L, n (%)	20 (30.3%)	2 (9.5%)	18 (40.0%)	0.020	 	 Total bilirubin, mumol/L	13.3 (9.3-17.1)	15.6 (11.8-19.3)	11.5 (8.8-16.7)	0.051	 	 Creatinine, mumol/L	74.0 (65.5-83.0)	78.0 (67.0-87.0)	74.0 (65.0-82.0)	0.401	 	 Fasting blood glucose, mmol/L	6.7 +- 2.3	5.8 +- 1.5	7.1 +- 2.6	0.047	 	 HbA1c, %	1.5 +- 0.6	1.3 +- 0.6	1.5 +- 0.6	0.145	 	 Triglycerides, mmol/L	3.9 +- 0.9	3.7 +- 0.9	4.1 +- 0.9	0.086	 	 Total cholesterol, mmol/L	1.0 +- 0.3	1.1 +- 0.2	1.0 +- 0.3	0.255	 	 HDL-cholesterol, mmol/L	2.3 +- 0.9	2.0 +- 0.9	2.4 +- 0.8	0.074	 	 LDL-cholesterol, mmol/L	7.0 +- 1.1	5.7 +- 0.5	7.3 +- 1.1	0.032	 	COVID-19 severity, n (%)				0.021	 	 Non-severe	47 (71.2%)	19 (90.5%)	28 (62.2%)		 	 Severe	19 (28.8%)	2 (9.5%)	17 (37.8%)		 	\nData are expressed as mean +- SD, medians and inter-quartile range or percentage.\nThe mean age of enrolled patients was 47 years and 74.2% were female. Table 1 shows the main clinical and biochemical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with MAFLD stratified by obesity status. Mean BMI for the non-obese and obese patients were 22.7 +- 2.1 kg/m2 and 28.3 +- 3.2 kg/m2, respectively. Compared with the non-obese group, obese patients had higher levels of aspartate aminotransferase, fasting blood glucose and LDL-cholesterol, and lower lymphocyte counts. Notably, MALFD patients that were obese had more severe COVID-19 disease (37.5% vs. 9.5%, p = 0.021).\nAs shown in Supplementary Table 1, there were 47 (71.2%) patients with non-severe COVID-19 and 19 (28.8%) with severe COVID-19. Compared to those with non-severe COVID-19, patients with severe disease were more obese (89.5% vs. 59.6%, p = 0.021). They were also more likely to be smokers (26.3% vs. 6.4%, p = 0.038), and had higher C-reactive protein concentrations (median 52.7 [IQR 33.5-74.9] vs. 18.3 [4.6-24.9], p &lt; 0.001) and lower lymphocyte counts (median 1.0 [IQR 0.8-1.2] vs. 1.4 [1.1-1.7], p = 0.005).\nAs shown in Supplementary Table 1, there were 47 (71.2%) patients with non-severe COVID-19 and 19 (28.8%) with severe COVID-19. Compared to those with non-severe COVID-19, patients with severe disease were more obese (89.5% vs. 59.6%, p = 0.021). They were also more likely to be smokers (26.3% vs. 6.4%, p = 0.038), and had higher C-reactive protein concentrations (median 52.7 [IQR 33.5-74.9] vs. 18.3 [4.6-24.9], p &lt; 0.001) and lower lymphocyte counts (median 1.0 [IQR 0.8-1.2] vs. 1.4 [1.1-1.7], p = 0.005).\nMultivariable-adjusted association between obesity (as exposure) and COVID-19 severity (as the outcome) in patients with MAFLD.\nTable 2	 	\n	OR	95% CI	P value	 	Unadjusted	5.77	1.19-27.91	0.029	 	Adjusted model I	6.25	1.23-31.71	0.027	 	Adjusted model II	6.32	1.16-34.54	0.033	 	\nModel 1: adjusted for age and sex.\nModel 2: adjusted for age, sex, smoking, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia.\nAs shown in Table 2 , in the unadjusted logistic regression model with COVID-19 severity as the outcome, the presence of obesity in MAFLD patients was associated with a ~6-fold increased risk of severe COVID-19 illness (unadjusted OR 5.77, 95% CI 1.19-27.91, p = 0.029). Notably, this association with obesity and COVID-19 severity remained significant (adjusted-OR 6.32, 95%CI 1.16-34.54, p = 0.033) even after adjusting for age, sex, smoking, diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidaemia.\nOur results show that in MAFLD patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, the presence of obesity markedly increases the risk of having severe illness. This association remained significant after adjusting for likely confounders.\nWe reported previously that obesity is associated with a nearly 3-fold increased risk for severe COVID-19 with a dose-effect relationship between increasing BMI and the proportion of patients with severe illness. In the current analysis, the risk of severe illness in MAFLD patients with co-existing obesity was &gt;6-fold greater after adjustment for confounders. These findings are distinct, suggesting that the risk of obesity to COVID-19 severity is significantly greater in those with MAFLD. However, the virological and physiological mechanisms underlying the relationship we observed are not clarified by the present data. Systemic inflammatory response syndrome, a common complication in severe COVID-19, is promoted by the activation of CD14+ and CD16+ inflammatory monocytes producing a larger amount of interleukin (IL)-6 and other proinflammatory factors. This suggests IL-6 is a key proinflammatory factor that triggers the inflammatory &quot;storm&quot; in patients. In MAFLD patients, particularly those with obesity, increased inflammatory activity in the liver and visceral fat is independently correlated with increased levels of IL-6, which might have an additive/synergistic role in promoting greater severity of COVID-19. It is conceivable that the secretion of hepatokines for example, reduced adiponectin or the altered secretion of inflammatory lipid mediators in obese patients with MAFLD, may also contribute to the current observations.\nWhile this is the first multi-center study to investigate obesity as a possible risk factor for severe COVID-19 illness in patients with MAFLD, some limitations should be recognized. Patients included in our study did not undergo liver biopsy, thus COVID-19 severity in relation to liver histology could not be assessed. Waist circumference, a risk factor for MAFLD, was not measured in our patients, which precluded adjustment of this confounder. In addition, patients were of Asian ethnicity and thus the applicability of the results to other ethnic groups is uncertain. Additional studies will be needed to confirm these findings and to better understand the underlying mechanisms for why the association with obesity is greater in those with MAFLD.\nIn conclusion, our data demonstrate that the risk of obesity to COVID-19 severity is greater in those with, than those without MAFLD.\nThe following is the supplementary data related to this article. \nSupplementary data to this article can be found online at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.metabol.2020.154244.\nDeclaration of competing interest\nAll authors declare no conflict of interests.\nReferences\nWHO characterizes COVID-19 as a pandemic\nClinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 in China\nA new definition for metabolic associated fatty liver disease: an international expert consensus statement\nThe crosstalk between hypoxia and innate immunity in the development of obesity-related nonalcoholic fatty liver disease\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease is associated with decreased lung function\nNon-alcoholic fatty liver disease and 30-day all-cause mortality in adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia\nAssociation between pulmonary function and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in the NHANES III Study\nObesity and overweight in Asian people\nMetabolic syndrome:a new world-wide definition.

tissue hypoxia.\n\n Therefore, we pursued the hypothesis, that tissue hypoxia may influence innate immune responses by transcriptional modulation of Toll-like receptor (TLRs) expression and function.\n\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nWe gained first insight from transcriptional profiling of murine dendritic cells exposed to hypoxia (2% oxygen for 24 h).\n\n While transcript levels of other TLRs remained unchanged, we found a robust induction of TLR2 (2.36±0.7-fold; P&lt;0.05) and TLR6 (3.46±1.56-fold; P&lt;0.05).\n\n Additional studies in different cells types and cell-lines including human dendritic cells, monocytic cells (MM6), endothelia (HMEC-1) or intestinal epithelia (Caco-2) confirmed TLR2 and TLR6 induction of transcript, protein and function during hypoxia.\n\n Furthermore, analysis of the putative TLR2 and TLR6 promoters revealed previously unrecognized binding sites for HIF-1, which were shown by chromatin immunoprecipitation to bind the pivotal hypoxia-regulating transcription factor HIF-1alpha.\n\n Studies using loss and gain of function of HIF-1 confirmed a critical role of HIF-1alpha in coordinating TLR2 and TLR6 induction.\n\n Moreover, studies of murine hypoxia (8% oxygen over 6 h) showed TLR2 and TLR 6 induction in mucosal organs in vivo.\n\n In contrast, hypoxia induction of TLR2 and TLR6 was abolished in conditional HIF-1? mutant mice.\n\n\nConclusions/Significance\nTaking together, these studies reveal coordinated induction of TLR2 and TLR6 during hypoxia and suggest tissue hypoxia in transcriptional adaptation of innate

applied in studies.\n\n We evaluated the impact of short-term IH on vascular and metabolic function in a diet-induced model of metabolic syndrome (MS).\n\n\nMethods\nMice were fed either a standard diet or a high fat diet (HFD) for 8 weeks.\n\n During the final 14 days of each diet, animals were exposed to either IH (1 min cycle, FiO2 5% for 30s, FiO2 21% for 30s; 8 h/day) or intermittent air (FiO2 21%).\n\n Ex-vivo vascular reactivity in response to acetylcholine was assessed in aorta rings by myography.\n\n Glucose, insulin and leptin levels were assessed, as well as serum lipid profile, hepatic mitochondrial activity and tissue nitric oxide (NO) release.\n\n\nResults\nMice fed with HFD developed moderate markers of dysmetabolism mimicking MS, including increased epididymal fat, dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis and endothelial dysfunction.\n\n HFD decreased mitochondrial complex I, II and IV activities and increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in liver.\n\n IH applied

(NASH).\n\n Another member of the toll-like receptor family, TLR-2, has been shown to play a role in lipid trafficking via uptake of diacylated lipoproteins.\n\n However, a role for TLR-2 in NASH has not been elucidated.\n\n The objectives of the current study were to examine the influence of dietary fat quality and TLR-2 on NASH pathogenesis.\n\n\nMethods\nSteatohepatitis was induced in male Db, C57BL/6 and TLR-2-/- mice by feeding an L-amino acid-defined diet that was deficient in methionine and choline (MCDD).\n\n Mice fed the base diet supplemented with methionine and choline (control diet; CD) were used as controls.\n\n To determine the role of fat quality, MCDD was enriched with polyunsaturated corn oil (PUFA) or coconut oil that is comprised mostly of saturated fat (SAFA); the total amount of each fat was 112.9 g/kg of diet.\n\n After 8 weeks of feeding CD or MCDD, hepatic steatosis, inflammation and necrosis were evaluated in histological sections.\n\n Total RNA was extracted from frozen liver samples and mRNA expression of TNF?, collagen ?1, IL-10, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-? (PPAR-?), TLR-4, and CD14, was analyzed via real-time PCR.\n\n Protein levels of TLR-2 were analyzed by western blot.\n\n\nResults\nPanlobular macrovessicular steatosis and diffuse leukocyte infiltration were noted in PUFA-fed Db mice.\n\n Histological scores demonstrated significantly less steatosis, inflammation and necrosis in SAFA-fed mice of all mouse strains.\n\n However, compared to wild type mice, hepatocellular damage was notably more severe in TLR-2-/- mice.\n\n Consistent with histological findings, mRNA expression of TNF? was elevated by approximately 3-fold in TLR-2-/- mice; PPAR-? expression was blunted in this strain compared to wild type.\n\n Expression of the matrix protein collagen ?I was also significantly higher in TLR-2-/- mice, indicating a pro-fibrogenic state.\n\n Sensitivity to steatohepatitis due to dietary fat or TLR-2 deficiency correlated significantly with alterations in the expression of TLR-4 as well as the co-receptor CD-14.\nConclusions\nOur findings suggest that dietary saturated fat plays a protective role against MCDD-induced steatohepatitis, whereas TLR-2 deficiency exacerbated NASH.\n\n The mechanism underlying the response to dietary fat and TLR-2 likely involves altered signalling via the TLR-4 pathway.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2891617","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Chantal A","surname":"Rivera","email":"crive1@lsuhsc.edu","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"LaTausha","surname":"Gaskin","email":"lgaski@lsuhsc.edu","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Monique","surname":"Allman","email":"miag23_99@yahoo.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jia","surname":"Pang","email":"jpang@lsuhsc.edu","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kristen","surname":"Brady","email":"kristen@winecountrynet.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Patrick","surname":"Adegboyega","email":"padegb@lsuhsc.edu","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kevin","surname":"Pruitt","email":"kpruit@lsuhsc.edu","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1097/01.alc.0000189287.83544.33","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Modulation of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis by pattern recognition receptors in mice: the role of toll-like receptors 2 and 4","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1126/science.1179721","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Metabolie syndrome and altered gut microbiota in mice lacking toll-like receptor 5","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.cell.2006.02.015","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Pathogen recognition and innate immunity","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.cyto.2008.01.006","date":"1970-01-01","title":"LPS/TLR4 signal transduction pathway","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1152/ajpendo.00302.2006","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Lipopolysaccharide activates an innate immune system response in human adipose tissue in obesity and type 2 diabetes","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.2337/dc10-1676","date":"2010-11-09","title":"Endotoxemia Is Associated With an Increased Risk of Incident Diabetes","abstract":"OBJECTIVE\nDiabetes is accompanied with a chronic low-grade inflammation, which may in part be mediated by endotoxins derived from Gram-negative bacteria.\n\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\nWe investigated in a population-based cohort whether endotoxemia is associated with clinically incident diabetes.\n\n The serum endotoxin activity was measured by limulus assay from the FINRISK97 cohort comprising 7,169 subjects aged 25–74 years and followed up for 10 years.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBoth the subjects with prevalent diabetes (n = 537) and those with incident diabetes (n = 462) had higher endotoxin activity than the nondiabetic individuals (P &lt;

assessed the effects of bacterial cell wall components on adiponectin, leptin and resistin secretion from rat visceral adipocytes in vitro.\n We also measured the relative population of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes in fecal microbiota and the amount of fecal mucin as an intestinal barrier function, when mice were fed a high-fat diet.\n In the present study, we demonstrated that bacterial cell wall components affect the secretion of adipokines, depending on the presence of antigens from gram-positive or gram-negative bacteria.\n Lipopolysaccharide markedly inhibited adiponectin, leptin, and resistin secretion, whereas peptidoglycan increased adiponectin secretion and decreased resistin secretion in vitro.\n In vivo experiments showed that the high-fat diet increased the population of Firmicutes and decreased that of Bacteroidetes.\n In contrast, the high-fat diet downregulated the stool output and fecal mucin content.\n These results demonstrate that bacterial cell wall components affect the onset of metabolic syndromes by mediating the secretion of adipokines from visceral adipose tissue.\n Furthermore, we believe that metabolic endotoxemia is not due to the increasing dominance of gram-negative bacteria, Bacteroidetes, but due to the depression of intestinal barrier function.\n","id":"PMC4345181","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"the Society for Free

not been studied in Asian Indians.\n\n In this case-control study, we aimed to analyse association of NAFLD with the sub-clinical inflammation and metabolic profile in Asian Indians in north India.\n\n\nMethods\nUltrasound diagnosed 120 cases of NAFLD were compared to 152 healthy controls without NAFLD.\n\n Anthropometric profile [body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), hip circumference (HC)], high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), metabolic profile [fasting blood glucose (FBG), lipid profile] and hepatic function tests [alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)] were recorded.\n\n\nResults\nMetabolic parameters [FBG, total cholesterol (TC), serum triglycerides (TG),low-density lipoprotein (LDL-c)], hs-CRP and prevalence of the metabolic syndrome were higher in cases as compared to controls (p-value&lt;0.05 for all).\n\n The median (range) of hs-CRP (mg/L) for cases [2.6(0.2–13.4)] were significantly higher than in controls [1.4(0.03–11.4), p?=?0.01].\n\n Similarly, higher values of hs-CRP were obtained when subgroups of cases with obesity, abdominal obesity and the metabolic syndrome were compared to controls [2.75 (0.03–14.3) vs.\n\n 1.52 (0.04–14.3), p?=?0.0010; 2.8 (0.03–14.3) vs.\n\n 1.5 (0.06–14.3), p?=?0.0014 and 2.7 (0.5–14.3) vs.\n\n 1.6 (0.06–8.5), p?=?0.0013, respectively.\n\n On multivariate logistic regression analysis BMI (p?=?0.001), WC (p?=?0.001), FBG (p?=?0.002), TC (p?=?0.008), TG (p?=?0.002), blood pressure (p?=?0.005), metabolic syndrome (p?=?0.001) and hs-CRP (p?=?0.003) were significantly and independently associated with NAFLD.\n\n After adjusting for significant variables, the association between high hs-CRP and NAFLD remained large and statistically significant [adjusted OR?=?1.17, 95% confidence interval (CI)?=?1.05–1.29].\n\n An increase in 1 mg/dl of hs-CRP level calculated to increase the risk of developing NAFLD by 1.7 times as compared to controls after adjusting for significant variables associated with NAFLD.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn this cohort of Asian Indians in North India, presence of NAFLD showed independent relationships with sub-clinical inflammation.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3543427","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

initiated to assess the health and nutritional status of the Korean population.\n\n From 2007 to 2010, 11,738 subjects were enrolled.\n\n The subjects were defined as having NAFLD when they had scores higher than ?0.640 in a NAFLD liver fat score prediction model, which was a previously validated prediction score.\n\n Individuals with forced expiratory volume in one second/forced vital capacity &lt;0.7 were considered to have OLD.\n\n The subjects were divided into non-OLD and OLD groups and non-NAFLD and NAFLD groups.\n\n All analyses were performed using sample weighting using the complex samples plan.\n\n\nResults\nThe prevalences of NAFLD and OLD were 30.2% and 8.9%, respectively.\n\n Although not statistically significant, subjects in the NAFLD group involved a higher tendency of having OLD than did those in the non-NAFLD group (8.5% vs 10.0%, respectively, P=0.060).\n\n Subjects with OLD showed a higher tendency to have NAFLD than non-OLD subjects (30.0% vs 33.7%, respectively, P=0.060).\n\n NAFLD subjects were at higher odds of OLD (odds ratio=1.334; 95% confidence interval=1.108–1.607, P=0.002) than non-NAFLD subjects, after adjusting for age, sex, and smoking history.\n\n OLD subjects were at higher odds of NAFLD (odds ratio=1.556; 95% confidence interval=1.288–1.879, P&lt;0.001) than non-OLD subjects, after adjusting for age, sex, and smoking history.\n\n\nConclusion\nThis study showed that NAFLD is related to OLD.\n\n Clinicians should be aware of possible liver comorbidities in OLD patients and that extrahepatic disease in NAFLD patients may vary more than previously thought.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6118278","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Dove Medical Press","authors":[{"firstname":"Sung

has been described, but the exact nature of this link remains unclear.\n\n Current epidemiological data refer exclusively to the MetS prevalence among patients with COPD and data about the prevalence of COPD in MetS patients are still unavailable.\n\n\nAim of the study\nTo analyse and compare risk factors, clinical and metabolic characteristics, as well as the main respiratory function parameters, among patients affected by MetS, COPD or both diseases.\n\n\nPatients\nWe recruited 59 outpatients with MetS and 76 outpatients with COPD.\n\n After medical history collection, physical examination, blood sampling for routine analysis, spirometric evaluation, they were subdivided into MetS (n = 46), MetS+COPD (n = 60), COPD (n = 29).\n\n\nResults\nA MetS diagnosis was assigned to 62% of COPD patients recruited in the COPD Outpatients Clinic of the Pneumology Department, while the COPD prevalence in MetS patients enrolled in the Internal Medicine Metabolic Disorders Outpatients Clinic was 22%.\n\n More than 60% of subjects enrolled in each Department were unaware that they suffered from an additional disease.\n\n MetS+COPD patients exhibited significantly higher C-peptide levels.\n\n We also found a positive relation between C-peptide and pack-years in all subjects and a negative correlation between C-peptide and vitamin D only in current smokers.\n\n Finally, a negative association emerged between smoking and vitamin D.\n\n\nConclusions\nWe have estimated, for the first time, the COPD prevalence in MetS and suggest a potential role of smoking in inducing insulin resistance.\n\n Moreover, a direct effect of smoking on vitamin D levels is proposed as a novel mechanism, which may account for both insulin resistance and COPD development.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5655494","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

from 72 patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and were scored for steatosis, grade and stage.\n\n Hepatic and skeletal muscle insulin resistance indices (hepatic insulin resistance index and Matsuda index, respectively) were calculated from 75-g oral glucose tolerance test data, and metabolic clearance rate was measured using the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp method.\n\n\nResults\nThe degree of hepatic steatosis, and grade and stage of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis were significantly correlated with Matsuda index (steatosis r = ?0.45, P &lt; 0.001; grade

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in

Transmission Dynamics in Wuhan, China, of Novel Coronavirus–Infected Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nThe initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

China.\n\n We aimed to further clarify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data.\n\n Outcomes were followed up until Jan 25, 2020.\nFindings\nOf the 99 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, 49 (49%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market.\n\n The average age of the patients was 55·5 years (SD 13·1), including 67 men and 32 women.\n\n 2019-nCoV was detected in all patients by real-time RT-PCR.\n\n 50 (51%) patients had chronic diseases.\n\n Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (82 [83%] patients), cough (81 [82%] patients), shortness of breath (31 [31%] patients), muscle ache (11 [11%] patients), confusion (nine [9%] patients), headache (eight [8%] patients), sore throat (five [5%] patients), rhinorrhoea (four [4%] patients), chest pain (two [2%] patients), diarrhoea (two [2%] patients), and nausea and vomiting (one [1%] patient).\n\n According to imaging examination, 74 (75%) patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 14 (14%) patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity, and one (1%) patient had pneumothorax.\n\n 17 (17%) patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and, among them, 11 (11%) patients worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection was of clustering onset, is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n In general, characteristics of patients who died were in line with the MuLBSTA score, an early warning model for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia.\n\n Further investigation is needed to explore the applicability of the MuLBSTA score in predicting the risk of mortality in 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key R&amp;D Program of China.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7135076","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

In the study by Guan et al.,(  7  ) which analyzed clinical characteristics of 1,099 patients with confirmed COVID-19 in China, 21.3% and 22.2% of patients presented elevated ALT and AST, respectively. These studies indicated that liver injury is common in patients with COVID-19.\nIt is reported that 2%-11% of patients with COVID-19 had comorbidities of chronic liver diseases (CLDs).(  8  ) Currently, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which affects a quarter of the global population, has emerged as the most common CLD.(  9  ) However, the clinical features of patients with COVID-19 with NAFLD are not clear. This study investigated the clinical features and liver injury in patients with COVID-19 with NAFLD in a multicenter cohort of patients with COVID-19 in Jiangsu Province, China.\nPatients and Methods\nPatients\nA total of 342 consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 were retrospectively enrolled from 10 designated hospitals in 10 cities of Jiangsu Province, China, between January 18, 2020, and February 26, 2020. The follow-up data of clinical outcomes were obtained up to February 29, 2020. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on guidance provided by the World Health Organization (WHO).(  10  ) All patients with COVID-19 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in throat swab samples by real-time polymerase chain reaction in accordance with guidance provided by the WHO.(  11  ) \nPatients with the following comorbidities were excluded: viral hepatitis (defined by positive serum hepatitis B surface antigen and/or hepatitis C antibody and/or a known history of chronic hepatitis B or chronic hepatitis C), significant alcohol consumption (defined by &gt;30 g/day in men and &gt;20 g/day in women), autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, or any other CLD. Our study was approved by the ethics committee of these hospitals, with a waiver of informed consent.\nData Collection\nThe epidemiologic, clinical, laboratory, radiologic, treatment, and outcomes data were collected from medical records of all the patients. All relevant data were entered into a computerized database and checked to avoid errors. The upper limit of normal (ULN) of ALT, AST, total bilirubin (Tbil), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were 40 U/L, 40 U/L, 20 mumol/L, 50 U/L, and 150 U/L, respectively. Abnormal liver function was defined as any parameter (ALT, AST, GGT, ALP, or Tbil) higher than the ULN.\nDefinition of NAFLD\nWe defined NAFLD using the published hepatic steatosis index (HSI) in the absence of other causes of CLD.(  12  ) This index has been validated and used in several studies,(  13 ,  14 ,  15 ,  16  ) and was calculated by using the following equation: HSI = 8 x ( ALT/AST ratio) + body mass index (BMI) (+2, if a female patient; +2, if diabetic).(  12  ) Serum ALT and AST results of the first test after admission were used for the calculation of the HSI. A cutoff of 36 was used to define the presence of NAFLD; this value has been validated and used in several studies.(  12 ,  13 ,  14 ,  15  ) \nStatistical Analysis\nAll data were analyzed using IBM SPSS, version 22.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY). Continuous data were presented as median (interquartile range [IQR]). Categorical data were shown as counts and percentages. Continuous variables between the two groups were analyzed using two-sample t tests or the Mann-Whitney U test, as appropriate, while categorical variables were analyzed by chi-square tests or Fisher's exact tests. Logistic regression was performed to select independent risk factors of elevated ALT (&gt;40 U/L). Variables having P &lt; 0.05 in univariate analysis were used for multivariate input logistic regression analysis. P &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nResults\nDemographic Characteristics and Onset Symptoms\nOf the 342 patients with COVID-19, 34 patients without BMI data and 7 patients with insufficient biochemistry data were excluded; 7 patients with alcohol abuse and 14 patients with other CLDs, such as chronic hepatitis B, were also excluded (Fig. 1). A total of 280 patients with COVID-19 were included for the final analysis; 52.1% of the patients were men, and the median age was 43.0 (IQR, 32.0-56.0) years. The median BMI was 24.2 (IQR, 21.9-26.2) kg/m2, and 38 (13.6%) of 280 patients met the diagnostic criteria of obesity (BMI &gt;=28 kg/m2). The median time from symptom onset to admission was 5.0 (IQR, 2.0-8.0) days.\nFlow chart of patient selection.\nFever (187 [66.8%]) and cough (156 [55.7%]) were the most common symptoms, followed by fatigue (58 [20.7%]), sore throat (32 [11.4%]), muscle ache (28 [10.0%]), shortness of breath (23 [8.2%]), and headache (19 [6.8%]). Seventy-one (25.4%) patients had one or more underlying medical conditions, including hypertension (45 [16.1%]), diabetes (21 [7.5%]), chronic lung diseases (10 [3.6%]), and malignant tumor (4 [1.4%]).

However, there were no significant differences in the median serum AST, Tbil, and ALP levels between the two groups. The proportion of abnormalities of chest CT images was also similar between the two groups (Table 2).\nDynamic Changes of Liver Function Tests During Hospitalization\nThe highest levels of liver function tests for each patient during hospitalization were selected for the analysis. During hospitalization, 176 (62.9%) patients presented abnormal liver function tests, including 131 (46.8%) patients with elevated ALT, 92 (32.9%) with elevated GGT, 74 (26.4%) with elevated AST, 72 (25.7%) with elevated Tbil, and 10 (3.6%) with elevated ALP. Among these patients, 76 (43.2%) patients had normal liver function on admission. The median peak values of ALT, AST, GGT, Tbil, and ALP were 39.0 (IQR, 24.0-66.0) U/L, 28.0 (IQR, 22.0-42.0) U/L, 34.0 (IQR, 18.0-60.0) U/L, 14.7 (IQR, 10.4-20.5) mumol/L, and 68.0 (IQR, 56.0-84.0) U/L during hospitalization, respectively.\nDuring hospitalization, the proportion of elevated ALT in patients with NAFLD was significantly higher than in patients without NAFLD (65.1% vs. 38.7%; P &lt; 0.001), while the proportion of elevated Tbil, AST, GGT, and ALP was comparable between the two groups. The median peak values of ALT (54.0 U/L vs. 33.0 U/L; P &lt; 0.001) and GGT (43.0 U/L vs. 28.0 U/L; P &lt; 0.001) were significantly higher in patients with NAFLD than in those without NAFLD during hospitalization.

Further multivariate analysis showed that age over 50 years (OR, 2.077; 95% CI, 1.183, 3.648; P = 0.011) and concurrent NAFLD (OR, 2.956; 95% CI, 1.526, 5.726; P = 0.001) were two independent risk factors of ALT elevation, while atomized inhalation of IFNalpha-2b (OR, 0.402; 95% CI, 0.236, 0.683; P = 0.001) was related to a reduced risk of ALT elevation.\nRisk Factors of Elevated ALT (&gt;40 U/L) During Hospitalization in Patients With COVID-19\nVariables	Univariate	Multivariate	 	OR (95% CI)	P Value		OR (95% CI)	P Value	 	Age					 	&lt;=50 years	Reference				 	&gt;50 years	1.847 (1.120, 3.047)	0.016	2.077 (1.183, 3.648)	0.011	 	Sex					 	Female	Reference				 	Male	1.753 (1.090, 2.819)	0.021	1.646 (0.975, 2.778)	0.062	 	BMI					 	&lt;28 kg/m2	Reference				 	&gt;=28 kg/m2	2.467 (1.205, 5.052)	0.014	0.901 (0.360, 2.258)	0.825	 	NAFLD					 	No	Reference				 	Yes	2.962 (1.745, 5.028)	&lt;0.001	2.956 (1.526, 5.726)	0.001	 	Severe illness					 	No	Reference				 	Yes	6.133 (2.259, 16.652)	&lt;0.001	4.009 (0.966, 16.638)	0.056	 	ICU					 	No	Reference				 	Yes	4.338 (1.391, 13.530)	0.011	0.931 (0.175, 4.946)	0.933	 	Hypertension					 	No	Reference				 	Yes	0.576 (0.297, 1.116)	0.102			 	Diabetes					 	No	Reference				 	Yes	0.842 (0.343, 2.067)	0.708			 	Atomized inhalation of IFNalpha-2b					 	No	Reference				 	Yes	0.389 (0.239, 0.633)	&lt;0.001	0.402 (0.236, 0.683)	0.001	 	Lopinavir/ritonavir					 	No	Reference				 	Yes	1.244 (0.733, 2.111)	0.418			 	Arbidol					 	No	Reference				 	Yes	1.218 (0.761, 1.949)	0.411			 	\nTreatment and Clinical Prognosis\nAtomized inhalation of IFNalpha-2b, lopinavir/ritonavir, and arbidol were the most commonly used antiviral drugs in our study; these account for 57.1%, 72.5%, and 49.3% of the patients, respectively (Table 5), while 73.6% of patients received empirical antibiotic treatment. In addition, 73 (26.1%) patients were given corticosteroids, and 35 (12.5%) patients were treated with gamma globulin. Up to February 29, 2020, a total of 22 (7.9%) patients developed respiratory failure and 4 (1.4%) patients progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, no patient developed liver failure and death. Twenty-eight (10.0%) patients were transferred to the ICU during hospitalization. As of February 29, 2020, 69 (24.6%) patients were still hospitalized. The treatment drugs, complications, and clinical outcomes were comparable between patients with and without NAFLD.\nTreatment, Complications, and Outcomes of Patients With COVID-19 With and Without NAFLD\nVariables (n [%])	All Patients (N = 280)	Non-NAFLD (n = 194)	NAFLD (n = 86)	P Value	 	Drug treatment					 	Atomized inhalation of IFNalpha-2b	160 (57.1)	116 (59.8)	44 (51.2)	0.178	 	Lopinavir/ritonavir	203 (72.5)	144 (74.2)	59 (68.6)	0.331	 	Arbidol	138 (49.3)	92 (47.4)	46 (53.5)	0.349	 	Antibiotic	206 (73.6)	141 (72.7)	65 (75.6)	0.612	 	Glucocorticoid	73 (26.1)	47 (24.2)	26 (30.2)	0.291	 	Gamma globulin	35 (12.5)	21 (10.8)	14 (16.3)	0.203	 	Complications					 	Respiratory failure	22 (7.9)	12 (6.2)	10 (11.6)	0.118	 	ARDS	4 (1.4)	2 (1.0)	2 (2.3)	0.4	 	Liver failure	0	0	0		 	Outcomes					 	Remained in hospital	69 (24.6)	46 (23.7)	23 (26.7)	0.587	 	Hospital discharge	211 (75.4)	148 (76.3)	63 (73.3)	0.587	 	Severe illness	28 (10.0)	16 (8.2)	12 (14.0)	0.142	 	Admission to ICU	18 (6.4)	13 (6.7)	5 (5.8)	0.78	 	Death	0	0	0		 	\nDiscussion\nIn our study, 30.7% of patients with COVID-19 had NAFLD. The global prevalence of NALFD is 6.3%-45% in the general population.(  9 ,  17  ) In most Asian countries, the prevalence of NAFLD is above 25%.(  9  ) A recent meta-analysis of NAFLD in Mainland China reported that the overall prevalence of NAFLD is about 30%.(  18  ) Thus, the rate of concurrent NAFLD in patients with COVID-19 in our study is consistent with the prevalence of NALFD in the general population in China, indicating that concurrent NAFLD may not be a risk factor of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nConsistent with other studies,(  6 ,  7  ) the most common symptoms were fever (66.8%) and cough (55.7%). However, the common symptoms were not significantly different between NAFLD and non-NAFLD groups. The most common laboratory abnormalities that we observed were leukopenia and lymphopenia. Fewer patients with COVID-19 with NAFLD had leukopenia and lymphopenia compared with patients without NAFLD. These findings need to be validated in the future, and the mechanisms deserve further investigation.\nWe found that 37.3% of patients presented abnormal liver function on admission; the most common included elevated ALT, AST, and GGT. Previous research also reported that 14%-53% of COVID-19 cases reported abnormal levels of ALT and AST.(  8  ) In the study by Zhang et al.,(  8  ) elevated GGT was observed in 30 (54%) of 56 patients with COVID-19. Thus, the proportions of elevated ALT, AST, and GGT in our study were consistent with reported data. However, we found that median levels of ALT and GGT as well as the proportion of elevated ALT and GGT were higher in patients with NAFLD compared to patients without NAFLD on admission. Furthermore, patients with NAFLD had a higher proportion of elevated ALT levels and higher peak ALT levels during hospitalization compared to those without NAFLD. Logistic regression analysis also confirmed that NAFLD was associated with elevated ALT in our study. These results indicate that patients with NAFLD are more likely to develop abnormal liver function after infection by SARS-CoV-2. However, the levels of elevated ALT, AST, and GGT were generally not high on admission or during hospitalization in our study. All patients with NAFLD with abnormal liver function tests showed mild to moderate liver damage; severe liver injury and liver failure were not observed in patients with or without NAFLD. Previous studies also reported that few patients developed severe liver-related complications.(  7 ,  19  ) \nCurrently, the mechanisms of COVID-19-related liver injury are not clear. It is reported that SARS-CoV-2 may directly cause liver injury through angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expressed in cytomembranes.(  20  ) Both liver cells and bile duct cells express ACE2.(  20  ) Thus, both hepatocyte and cholangiocyte injury may occur in COVID-19. In our study, besides ALT and AST, increased GGT, which is a diagnostic biomarker for cholangiocyte injury, was also observed. Drug-induced liver injury may be another possible contributing factor to the observed abnormal liver function test because some patients developed liver function abnormalities after therapeutics began.(  19  ) However, mild elevations of liver enzymes, such as ALT, are also common in NAFLD.(  21  ) Further investigations are needed to understand the mechanisms of liver injury caused by the interaction between existing NAFLD and COVID-19.\nWe analyzed the risk factors of liver injury in COVID-19. Age over 50 years was a risk factor of ALT elevation. Thus, more attention should be paid to elderly patients. We found atomized inhalation of IFNalpha-2b to be related to a reduced risk of ALT &gt;40 U/L. One interpretation may be that atomized inhalation of IFNalpha-2b suppresses SARS-CoV-2 and reduces liver impairment caused by the virus. However, further studies are needed to confirm our hypothesis.\nIn our study, only 7.9% of patients developed respiratory failure and 1.4% progressed to ARDS; 6.4% of patients were transferred to the ICU during hospitalization, but no patient died. However, the complications and clinical outcomes were comparable between patients with and without NAFLD. Although more patients with NAFLD presented abnormal liver function, concurrent NAFLD is not associated with adverse clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Most of our patients were young, and the proportion of comorbidities was relatively low in our study, which may be associated with the good prognosis of our cohort. Ji et al.(  22  ) reported the prevalence of NAFLD in progressive patients with COVID-19 was higher than stable patients (87.2% vs. 25.8%); however, the median age and comorbidities in progressive patients with COVID-19 were also significantly higher than stable patients. Another study revealed that concurrent NAFLD increased the risk of progression to severe COVID-19 in patients without diabetes, but the sample size was relatively small.(  23  ) Thus, the impacts of NAFLD on the prognosis of COVID-19 deserve further investigation.\nIn general, the prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) is higher in patients with NAFLD than those without NAFLD.(  24  ) We found the incidence of DM in patients with NAFLD (11.6%) to be higher than those without NAFLD (5.7%). However, there was no significant difference of incidence of DM between these two groups (P = 0.081). A possible reason may be the relatively small sample size with only 21 patients (7.5%) having DM in our study. We found fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels to be comparable between patients with NAFLD and those without NAFLD. However, all patients were diagnosed with DM before SARS-CoV-2 infection. These patients have been treated with hypoglycemic drugs, which may partially interpret the comparable FBG levels between the two groups.\nThis study has some limitations. First, using the HSI to define NAFLD in the absence of known liver disease may misclassify and under/overestimate the presence of NAFLD. However, HSI was proposed by Lee et al.(  12  ) as a diagnostic tool for NAFLD and has been validated by several studies with acceptable diagnostic accuracy.(  12 ,  25 ,  26 ,  27  ) Due to the emergency situation, liver histology and/or radiologically for the diagnosis of NAFLD was not available in our study. Although liver histology is considered to be the gold standard for the diagnosis of NAFLD, it cannot be conducted on the general population or for patients with COVID-19. Second, patients with NAFLD have been reported to have a greater chance of developing drug-induced hepatotoxicity, and this may have contributed to the greater AST/ALT values and impact the HSI scores.(  28 ,  29 ,  30 ,  31  ) Third, the fibrosis stages of patients were not assessed in our cohort. FibroScan is a promising measurement to assess the presence of NAFLD and fibrosis stages in CLDs.(  32 ,  33  ) However, FibroScan is not a routine test for patients with COVID-19, and the information was not available for our study. Prospective studies using imaging or even histology to determine the presence of NAFLD and fibrosis stages of patients are needed to confirm the impacts of NAFLD on COVID-19.\nIn conclusion, patients with NAFLD are more likely to develop liver injury when infected by SARS-CoV-2. However, no patient with COVID-19 with NAFLD developed severe liver injury during hospitalization. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm our findings.\nReferences\nAuthor names in bold designate shared co-first authorship.\nA novel coronavirus from patients with pneumonia in China, 2019\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus: the species and its viruses - a statement of the Coronavirus Study Group\nEpidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study\nClinical characteristics of 138 hospitalized patients with 2019 novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia in Wuhan, China\nClinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China\nClinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 in China\nLiver injury in COVID-19: management and challenges\nGlobal epidemiology of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease-meta-analytic assessment of prevalence, incidence, and outcomes\nHepatic steatosis index: a simple screening tool reflecting nonalcoholic fatty liver disease\nDepression is associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease among adults in the United States\nRace/ethnicity-based temporal changes in prevalence of NAFLD-related advanced fibrosis in the United States, 2005-2016\nElevated urinary bisphenol A levels are associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease among adults in the United States\nPerformance and limitations of steatosis biomarkers in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease\nGuidelines of prevention and treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (2018, China)\nThe epidemiology of NAFLD in Mainland China with analysis by adjusted gross regional domestic product: a meta-analysis\nClinical features of COVID-19-related liver functional abnormality\nSpecific ACE2 expression in cholangiocytes may cause liver damage after 2019-nCoV infection\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease in Brazil.

P?&lt;?.\n01) was negatively correlated with the CT severity scores.\n The receiver?operating characteristic analysis demonstrated that area under the curve of CRP on the first visit for predicting severe COVID?19 was 0.87 (95% CI 0.10–1.00) at 20.42 mg/L cut?off, with sensitivity and specificity 83% and 91%, respectively.\n CRP in severe COVID?19 patients increased significantly at the initial stage, before CT findings.\n Importantly, CRP, which was associated with disease development, predicted early severe COVID?19.","id":"PMC7262341","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley and Sons Inc.","authors":[{"firstname":"Chaochao","surname":"Tan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fengxia","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kui","surname":"Tan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qionghui","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xixin","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaosong","surname":"Li","email":"lxsong0308@163.com","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.eclinm.2020.100375","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Eosinopenia and elevated C-reactive protein facilitate triage of COVID-19 patients in fever clinic: A retrospective case-control study","abstract":"Background\nCoronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently a pandemic affecting over 200 countries.\n\n Many cities have established designated fever clinics to triage suspected COVID-19 patients from other patients with similar symptoms.\n\n However, given the limited availability of the nucleic acid test as well as long waiting time for both the test and radiographic examination, the quarantine or therapeutic decisions for a large number of mixed patients were often not made in time.\n\n We aimed to identify simple and quickly available laboratory biomarkers to facilitate effective triage at the fever clinics for sorting suspected COVID-19 patients from those with COVID-19-like symptoms.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected clinical, etiological, and laboratory data of 989 patients who visited the Fever Clinic at Wuhan Union Hospital, Wuhan, China, from Jan 31 to Feb 21. Based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) nucleic acid testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection, they were divided into two groups: SARS-CoV-2-positive patients as cases and SARS-CoV-2-negative patients as controls.\n\n We compared the clinical features and laboratory findings of the two groups, and analyzed the diagnostic performance of several laboratory parameters in predicting SARS-CoV-2 infection and made relevant comparisons to the China diagnosis guideline of having a normal or decreased number of leukocytes (?9·5 109/L) or lymphopenia (&lt;1·1 109/L).\n\n\nFindings\nNormal or decreased number of leukocytes (?9·5 109/L), lymphopenia (&lt;1·1 109/L), eosinopenia (&lt;0·02 109/L), and elevated hs-CRP (?4 mg/L) were presented in 95·0%, 52·2%, 74·7% and 86·7% of COVID-19 patients, much higher than 87·2%, 28·8%, 31·3% and 45·2% of the controls, respectively.\n\n The eosinopenia produced a sensitivity of 74·7% and specificity of 68·7% for separating the two groups with the area under the curve (AUC) of 0·717.

also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.\n\n Increasing quartile of NLR was statistically significantly associated with secondary outcome.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR is associated with outcomes in unselected critically ill patients.\n\n In patients with sepsis, there was no statistically significant relationship between NLR and mortality.\n\n Further investigation is required to increase understanding of the

recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like

(NAFLD) becomes characteristic of liver disease in China, with unknown bilateral influence.\n\n We aimed to investigate the effect of hepatic steatosis, a common hepatocyte change in NAFLD, on antiviral therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB).\n\n\nMethods and Findings\nWe carried out a prospective nested case control study in CHB patients receiving Entecavir for initial antiviral therapy, by recording demographic, anthropometric and clinical data at baseline, 24wk, 48wk and 96wk.\n\n Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression were applied to find out independent factors of hepatic steatosis and Entecavir treatment failure.\n\n The rates of HBV-DNA clearance, HBeAg seroconversion and ALT normalization were compared between CHB patients with and without steatosis by post hoc analysis.\n\n A total of 267 Chinese patients with CHB entered final analysis, with overall percentages of hepatic steatosis and HBeAg positive as 30.5% and 62.4%.\n\n Multivariate analysis showed waist circumference, serum TG and uric acid levels were independent factors of hepatic steatosis.\n\n The response rates to Entecavir were 54.9%, 63.8%, 74.2% at 24wk, 48wk and 96wk.\n\n Hepatic steatosis was revealed as an independent factor of Entecavir treatment failure by multivariate logistic regression at 24wk, 48wk and 96wk.\n\n In CHB patients with hepatic steatosis, HBV-DNA clearance and HBeAg seroconversion were both lower throughout the follow-up, but only the former reached statistical significance.\n\n Besides, ALT normalization was also

Triglycerides Predict the Presence of Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis","abstract":"Background\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the critical public health problems in China.\n\n The full spectrum of the disease ranges from simple steatosis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC).\n\n The infiltration of inflammatory cells characterizes NASH.\n\n This characteristic contributes to the progression of hepatitis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and HCC.\n\n Therefore, distinguishing NASH from NAFLD is crucial.\n\n\nObjective and Methods\nNinety-five patients with NAFLD, 44 with NASH, and 51 with non-NASH were included in the study to develop a new scoring system for differentiating NASH from NAFLD.\n\n Data on clinical and biological characteristics, as well as blood information, were obtained.\n\n Cytokeratin-18 (CK-18) fragments levels were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay.\n\n\nResults\nSeveral indexes show significant differences between the two groups, which include body mass index (BMI), waist-on-hip ratio (WHR), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), ?-glutamyl transpeptidase (?-GT), platelets, uric acid (UA), hs-C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), triglycerides (TG), albumin (ALB), and CK-18 fragments (all P &lt; 0.05).\n\n The CK-18 fragment levels showed a significant positive correlation with steatosis severity, ballooning, lobular inflammation, and fibrosis stage (all P &lt; 0.05).\n\n Therefore, a new model that combines ALT, platelets, CK-18 fragments, and TG was established by logistic regression among NAFLD patients.\n\n The AUROC curve in predicting NASH was 0.920 (95% CI: 0.866 - 0.974, cutoff value = 0.361, sensitivity = 89%, specificity = 86%, positive predictive value = 89%, negative predictive value = 89%).\n\n \nConclusion\nThe novel scoring system may be considered as a useful model in predicting the presence of NASH in NAFLD patients.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3853116","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

and is emerging as a major cause of chronic liver disease and liver transplantation.\n Among the various phenotypes of NAFLD, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is highly likely to progress to development of end-stage liver disease and cardiometabolic disease, resulting in liver-related and non-liver–related mortality.\n Nonetheless, there is no standardized pharmacotherapy against NASH and many drugs are under development in ongoing clinical trials.\n To develop a successful anti-NASH drug, it is necessary to select an appropriate target population and treatment outcomes depending on whether the mode of action is anti-metabolic, anti-inflammatory or anti-fibrotic.\n Recently, innovative surrogate markers have been investigated to replace hard outcomes such as liver histology and mortality and reduce the clinical trial duration.\n Currently, several drugs with fast track designation are being tested in phase III clinical trials, and many other drugs have moved into phase II clinical trials.\n Both lean NAFLD and typical obese NAFLD have been extensively studied and genetic variants such as PNPLA3 and TM6SF2 have been identified as significant risk factors for lean NAFLD.\n In the near future, noninvasive biomarkers and effective targeted therapies for NASH and associated fibrosis are required to develop precision medicine and tailored therapy according to

Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Meta-Analysis","abstract":"Background\nThe association between hepatitis B virus (HBV) mutations and hepatocarcinogenesis remains controversial because of conflicting data in the literature.\n\n We conducted a meta-analysis of case–control and cohort studies to examine HBV PreS, enhancer II (EnhII), basal core promoter (BCP), and precore mutations in relation to the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).\n\n\nMethods\nWe searched databases for studies of these associations that were published in English or Chinese up to August 31, 2008. HBV mutation–specific odds ratios and relative risks were pooled by use of a random-effects model and stratified by potential confounders.\n\n All statistical tests were two-sided.\n\n\nResults\nOf the 43 studies included in this meta-analysis, 40 used a case–control design.\n\n The 43 studies evaluated a total of 11?582 HBV-infected participants, of whom 2801 had HCC.\n\n Statistically significant summary odds ratios of HCC were obtained for any PreS mutation (3.77, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.57 to 5.52), C1653T in EnhII (2.76, 95% CI = 2.09 to 3.64), T1753V (2.35, 95% CI = 1.63 to 3.40), and A1762T/G1764A in BCP (3.79, 95% CI = 2.71 to 5.29).\n\n PreS mutations were more strongly associated with an increased risk of HCC in subjects who were infected with HBV genotype C than in those who were infected with HBV genotype B, whereas the opposite was true for A1762T/G1764A.\n\n C1653T, T1753V, and A1762T/G1764A were more strongly associated with an increased risk of HCC in hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)–positive subjects than in HBeAg-negative subjects.\n\n PreS mutations, C1653T, T1753V, and A1762T/G1764A accumulated during the progression of chronic HBV infection from the asymptomatic carrier state to HCC (Ptrend &lt; .\n\n001 for each mutation).\n\n PreS mutations, C1653T, C1653T + T1753V, and A1762T/G1764A-based combinations of mutations had specificities greater than 80% for the prediction of HCC.\n\n The precore mutations G1896A and C1858T were not associated with the risk of HCC, regardless of HBeAg status and HBV genotype.\n\n\nConclusions\nHBV PreS mutations, C1653T, T1753V, and A1762T/G1764A are associated with an increased risk of HCC.\n\n These mutations alone and in combination may be predictive for hepatocarcinogenesis.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2720989","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Oxford University Press","authors":[{"firstname":"Shijian","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hongwei","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chunying","surname":"Gu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jianhua","surname":"Yin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yongchao","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jiaxin","surname":"Xie","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Guangwen","surname":"Cao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Should treatment of hepatitis B depend on hepatitis B virus genotypes?

works?","abstract":"Introduction\nChronic hepatitis B (CHB) affects over 350 million people worldwide and can lead to life-threatening complications, including liver failure and hepatocellular cancer (HCC).\n\n Modern antiviral therapies could stem the rising tide of hepatitis B-related HCC, provided that individuals and populations at risk can be reliably identified through hepatitis B screening and appropriately linked to care.\n\n Opportunistic disease screening cannot deliver population-level outcomes, given the large number of undiagnosed people, but they may be achievable through well-organized and targeted community-based screening interventions.\n\n\nMaterial and methods\n This review summarizes the experience with community-based CHB screening programs published in the English-language literature over the last 30 years.\n\n\nResults\n They include experiences from Taiwan, the USA, The Netherlands, New Zealand, and Australia.\n\n Despite great variability in program setting and design, successful programs shared common features, including effective community engagement incorporating the target population’s cultural values and the ability to provide low-cost or free access to care, including antiviral treatment.\n\n\nConclusion\n While many questions still remain about the best funding mechanisms to ensure program sustainability and what the most effective strategies are to ensure program reach, linkage to care, and access to treatment, the evidence suggests scope for cautious optimism.\n\n A number of successful, large-scale initiatives in the USA, Asia–Pacific, and Europe demonstrated the feasibility of community-based interventions in effectively screening large numbers of people with CHB.\n\n By providing an effective mechanism for community

Screening and Vaccination Strategies for Newly Arrived Adult Canadian Immigrants and Refugees: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis ","abstract":"Background\nImmigrants have increased mortality from hepatocellular carcinoma as compared to the host populations, primarily due to undetected chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.\n\n Despite this, there are no systematic programs in most immigrant-receiving countries to screen for chronic HBV infection and immigrants are not routinely offered HBV vaccination outside of the universal childhood vaccination program.\n\n\nMethods and findings\nA cost-effective analysis was performed to compare four HBV screening and vaccination strategies with no intervention in a hypothetical cohort of newly-arriving adult Canadian immigrants.\n\n The strategies considered were a) universal vaccination, b) screening for prior immunity and vaccination, c) chronic HBV screening and treatment, and d) combined screening for chronic HBV and prior immunity, treatment and vaccination.\n\n The analysis was performed from a societal perspective, using a Markov model.\n\n Seroprevalence estimates, annual transition probabilities, health-care costs (in Canadian dollars), and utilities were obtained from the published literature.\n\n Acute HBV infection, mortality from chronic HBV, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and costs were modeled over the lifetime of the cohort of immigrants.\n\n Costs and QALYs were discounted at a rate of 3% per year.\n\n Screening for chronic HBV infection, and offering treatment if indicated, was found to be the most cost-effective intervention and was estimated to cost $40,880 per additional QALY gained, relative to no intervention.\n\n This strategy was most cost-effective for immigrants &lt; 55 years of age and would cost &lt; $50,000 per additional QALY gained for immigrants from areas where HBV seroprevalence is ? 3%.\n\n Strategies that included HBV vaccination were either prohibitively expensive or dominated by the chronic HBV screening strategy.\n\n\nConclusions\nScreening for chronic HBV infection from regions where most Canadian immigrants originate, except for Latin America and the Middle East, was found to be reasonably cost-effective and has the potential to reduce HBV-associated morbidity and mortality.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3799697","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

Hepatocellular Carcinoma","abstract":"Background\nThe risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) increases with increasing level of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in serum (viral load).\n\n However, it is unclear whether genetic characteristics of HBV, including HBV genotype and specific genetic mutations, contribute to the risk of HCC.\n\n We examined the HCC risk associated with HBV genotypes and common variants in the precore and basal core promoter (BCP) regions.\n\n\nMethods\nFrom January 5, 1991, to December 21, 1992, baseline blood samples were collected from 2762 Taiwanese men and women who were seropositive for HBV surface antigen but had not been diagnosed with HCC; the samples were tested for HBV viral load by real-time polymerase chain reaction and genotyped by melting curve analysis.\n\n Participants who had a baseline serum HBV DNA level greater than 104 copies/mL (n = 1526) were tested for the precore G1896A and BCP A1762T/G1764A mutants by direct sequencing.\n\n Incident cases of HCC were ascertained through follow-up examinations and computerized linkage to the National Cancer Registry and death certification profiles.\n\n A Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the risk of HCC associated with HBV genotype and precore and BCP mutants after adjustment for other risk factors.\n\n All statistical tests were two-sided.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 153 HCC cases occurred during 33?847 person-years of follow-up.\n\n The HCC incidence rates per 100?000 person-years for participants infected with HBV genotype B or C were 305.6 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 236.9 to 388.1) and 785.8 (95% CI = 626.8 to 972.9), respectively.\n\n Among participants with a baseline HBV DNA level of at least 104 copies/mL, HCC incidence per 100?000 person-years was higher for those with the precore G1896 (wild-type) variant than for those with the G1896A variant (955.5 [95% CI = 749.0 to 1201.4] vs 269.4 [95% CI = 172.6 to 400.9]) and for those with the BCP A1762T/G1764A double mutant than for those with BCP A1762/G1764 (wild-type) variant (1149.2 [95% CI = 872.6 to 1485.6] vs 358.7 [95% CI = 255.1 to 490.4]).\n\n The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio of developing HCC was 1.76 (95% CI = 1.19 to 2.61) for genotype C vs genotype B, 0.34 (95% CI = 0.21 to 0.57) for precore G1896A vs wild type, and 1.73 (95% CI = 1.13 to 2.67) for BCP A1762T/G1764A vs wild type.\n\n Risk was highest among participants infected with genotype C HBV and wild type for the precore 1896 variant and mutant for the BCP 1762/1764 variant (adjusted hazard ratio = 2.99, 95% CI = 1.57 to 5.70, P &lt; .\n\n001).\n\n\nConclusions\nHBV genotype C and specific alleles of BCP and precore were associated with risk of HCC.\n\n These associations were

Chinese patients with chronic hepatitis B: a cross-sectional survey with pair-matched healthy controls","abstract":"Objective\nFew studies have evaluated health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) in mainland China.\n\n We aimed at characterizing the impact of CHB on HRQoL in mainland Chinese and finding out factors associated with HRQoL.\n\n\nMethods\n460 CHB patients (323 with CHB only, 54 with compensated cirrhosis and 83 with decompensated cirrhosis) and 460 pair-matched healthy controls were recruited in Xi’an city.\n\n They answered a structured questionnaire including the Short Form 36 version 2 (SF-36v2), the Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire (CLDQ) (only for patients), and questions on socio-demographic and clinical characteristics.\n\n A blood sample was collected from each of patients for liver function tests.\n\n SF-36v2 scores were compared between patients and controls overall and by groups by paired-samples t-test, and CLDQ scores and paired differences of SF-36v2 scores were compared among three patient groups by one-way ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis test.\n\n Multi-variable linear regression analyses were performed to identify determinants of HRQoL in patients.\n\n\nResults\nPatients, overall and by groups had significantly lower SF-36v2 scores than controls on all summaries and domains, with differences higher than the suggested minimally important difference values.\n\n Both the SF-36v2 and the CLDQ showed that HRQoL of patients with cirrhosis further deteriorated, but compensated and decompensated cirrhosis patients had similar total HRQoL impairments.\n\n The gradually increasing impairment with disease progression was confirmed only on physical components.\n\n Impaired liver function and currently taken anti-viral treatment were associated with lower HRQoL.\n\n Education attainment and annual per capita household income had a positive effect on HRQoL.\n\n\nConclusions\nMainland Chinese CHB patients suffered significant HRQoL impairment on all health dimensions, and the impairment reached a high level on mental health at initial stage of illness and increased gradually on physical health with disease progression.\n\n Attention should be paid to the reduction of patients’ treatment cost burden and the provision of early health education accompanied with proper treatments.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4067057","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

problem, especially in China.\n\n Chronic liver disease affects health related quality of life (HRQOL).\n\n The intervention method to improve HRQOL in patients with hepatitis B has been one-dimensional with inconsistent results.\n\n The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of comprehensive intervention on health-related quality of life and provide guidance on improving HRQOL for patients with chronic hepatitis B.\n\n\nMethods\nPatients with chronic hepatitis B eligible for our study were randomly selected in three model regions of Jiangsu Province in June 2010. 272 patients were invited and 254 took part, with a refusal rate of 6.62%.\n\n Comprehensive intervention included government support, technical guidance from the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, standardised medical care, and community involvement.\n\n HRQOL before and 1 year after intervention was measured with the Short Form 36 and HBV-specific health surveys.\n\n Chi-square test, t-test and multiple linear regressive analyses were used.\n\n\nResults\nAfter comprehensive intervention, the HRQOL in patients with chronic hepatitis B showed significantly improvements in bodily pain, vitality, social functioning, and mental, as well as physical and mental component score (p &lt; 0.05).\n\n Family and social support increased, and financial concerns decreased (p &lt; 0.05).\n\n Marital status, duration of illness-related absence from work, education level, family financial status, and health insurance type were important factors affecting HRQOL change between the baseline and final assessment in patients with chronic hepatitis B.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe comprehensive intervention was effective in improving the HRQOL of patients with chronic hepatitis

positive or negative and without genotypic resistance to telbivudine at the end of the GLOBE/015 trials, were enrolled into a further 2-year extension study.\n A group of 502 patients completed 4 years of continuous telbivudine treatment and were included in the telbivudine per-protocol population.\n Amongst 293 HBeAg-positive patients, 76.2% had undetectable serum HBV DNA and 86.0% had normal

ALT.\n In patients who had discontinued telbivudine treatment due to HBeAg seroconversion, the HBeAg response was durable in 82% of patients (median 111 weeks of off-treatment follow-up).\n The cumulative 4-year resistance rate was 10.6% for HBeAg-positive and 10.0% for HBeAg-negative patients.\n Most adverse events were mild or moderate in severity and transient.\n Renal function measured

resistance of de novo combination therapy versus monotherapy for treatment naive patients of chronic hepatitis B (CHB).\n\n\nObjectives\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and resistance of de novo combination of lamivudine (LAM) and adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) compared with entecavir (ETV) monotherapy for nucleos(t)ide–naive patients with CHB.\n\n\nStudy design\nPublications on the effectiveness and resistance of LAM plus ADV versus ETV monotherapy for nucleos(t)ide-naive patients with CHB were identified by a search of PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Web of science, OVID, and CBM (Chinese Biological Medical Literature) until May 1, 2013. Biochemical response, hepatitis B e antigen seroconversion, and viroligic response were extracted and combined to obtain an integrated result.\n\n Viral resistance and safety were reviewed.\n\n\nResults\nFive eligible studies (328 patients in total) were included in the analysis.\n\n LAM plus ADV combination therapy produced more rapid HBV DNA reduction rate at 12 weeks than that of ETV monotherapy.\n\n At 48 weeks, the combination group had superior viroligic response rates compared with ETV group (90.0% vs.\n\n 78.9%, P=0.01).\n\n The difference in the ALT normalization and HBeAg seroconversion rates was not found.\n\n At week 96, LAM?+?ADV was more effective than ETV in ALT normalization [RR?=?1. 11, 95% CI (1.02, 1.21), P =0.01] and HBeAg seroconversion [RR?=?2.00, 95% CI (1.26, 3.18, P=0.003)], and no significant difference was found in the virologic response (P =0.23).\n\n No viral resistance occurred in combination therapy and six patients in ETV group were experienced with viral breakthrough.\n\n Both groups were well tolerated.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe de novo LAM plus ADV combination therapy for treatment-naïve patients with CHB was greater than ETV monotherapy in both biochemical response and HBeAg seroconversion rate up to 96 weeks.\n\n The rate of emergence of viral resistance in the combination group was less than that in the ETV

prolonged consolidation therapy with NUCs.\n\n We investigated the rate of HBV relapse after stopping NUCs therapy with different time period of prolonged consolidation therapy in HBeAg positive CHB patients, and analyzed the associated-factor of recurrence.\n\n\nMethods\nWe recruited 162 HBeAg-positive CHB patients who met the standard of stopping NUCs therapy recommended by the 2005 APASL.\n\n Patients in group A, without the prolonged consolidation therapy, were as controls.\n\n Patients in group B were divided into 3 subgroups (group B1, 7 (range 3–11) months of the prolonged consolidation therapy; group B2, 17 (range 13–20) months of the prolonged consolidation therapy; group B3, 28 (range 25–34) months of the prolonged consolidation therapy).\n\n Virologic relapse was defined as an increase in serum HBV DNA to &gt;103copies/ml after off-therapy.\n\n\nResults\nOne hundred and thirty-six patients (group A, 40 patients; group B1, 54 patients; group B2, 23 patients; group B3, 19 patients) were eligible for this study.\n\n The cumulative rates of relapse in group B at 6 months and 48 months were 29.2%, 41.7% after off-therapy, respectively.\n\n The cumulative rates of relapse in group B were statistically lower than that in group A at the same time periods.\n\n The cumulative rate of relapse in group B3 or group B2 was statistically lower than that in

address this issue, we did a review of the literatures and analyzed the data with emphasis on the survival and reduction in serum HBV DNA level.\n\n\nMethods\nWe searched 11 randomized controlled trials that included 654 patients with chronic hepatitis B-associated liver failure.\n\n 340 patients adopted nucleoside analogue, such as lamivudine (LAM), entecavir (ETV), telbivudine (LdT), or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), and the remaining 314 patients adopted no nucleoside analogue or placebo.\n\n A meta-analysis was carried out to examine the survival, HBV e antigen serologic conversion, and reduction in serum HBV DNA level.\n\n The pooled odds ratio (OR) was used to reflect the treatment effects.\n\n\nResults\nThe overall analysis revealed nucleoside analogue significantly improved 1-month(OR?=?2.10; 95% CI, [1.29, 3.41]; p?=?0.003), 3-month (OR?=?2.15; 95% CI, [1.26, 3.65]; p?=?0.005), 12-month survival (OR?=?4.62; 95% CI, [1.96, 10.89]; p?=?0.0005).\n\n Comparison of 3-month HBV DNA showed significant reduction for adoptive nucleoside analogue patients (OR?=?54.47; 95% CI, [16.37, 201.74]; p&lt;0.00001).\n\n Comparison of 3-month HBV e antigen serologic conversion showed a highly significant improvement of HBV e antigen lost for patients received adoptive antiviral therapy (OR?=?6.57; 95% CI, [1.64, 26.31]; p?=?0.008).\n\n\nConclusions\nThe benefits of nucleoside analogue on patients with chronic hepatitis B-associated liver failure is significant for improving patient survival, HBV e antigen serologic conversion, and rapid reduction of

timely liver transplantation is performed.\n\n The baseline bilirubin level has been reported to be an important prognostic factor for mortality.\n\n Here we conducted a prospective observational study to examine the clinical performance of this predictor.\n\n\nMethod\nTwenty-one consecutive chronic hepatitis B patients experiencing severe acute exacerbation were treated with either telbivudine or entecavir.\n\n The clinical characteristics at baseline and week-2 were documented and correlated with mortality.\n\n\nResults\nOf the 21 patients included, 9 had baseline bilirubin &gt;10 mg/dL.\n\n Four of these 9 patients (44.4%) eventually died, whereas all other patients survived.\n\n During the initial 2-week period, the change of bilirubin was ?1.2 mg/dl in the survivors, but was +8.05 mg/dl in the mortalities (P = 0.009).\n\n When this on-treatment factor was combined, 5 of the 21 patients had baseline bilirubin &gt; 10 mg/dL plus an increase of bilirubin level at week-2. Of these 5 patients, 4 (80%) died.\n\n Thus, by combining the baseline and on-treatment bilirubin levels, a positive predictive value of 80% and a negative predictive value of 100% could be achieved.\n\n Other significant on-treatment mortality predictors (at week-2) included higher international normalized ratio of prothrombin time (2.75 vs.\n\n 1.3, P = 0.004), higher model for end-stage liver disease score (30 vs.\n\n 17, P = 0.006), lower alpha-fetoprotein level (36.3 vs.\n\n 459.6 ng/mL, P = 0.039), and more rapid deterioration of the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (P = 0.008).\n\n Interestingly, during the course, deterioration of eGFR was statistically significant in entecavir-treated (P = 0.028), but not in telbivudine-treated patients.\n\n Additionally, the patients treated with telbivudine had significant increase in serum alpha-fetoprotein (27.9 to 191.9 ng/ml, P = 0.046) in the first 2 weeks, whereas the corresponding feature was not found in those treated with entecavir (P = 0.139).\n\n\nConclusions\nIn this prospective observational study, we discovered that the baseline and on-treatment bilirubin levels should be combined to achieve a better predictive value.\n\n Telbivudine might have a renoprotective effect in addition to its efficacy in viral suppression in patients with severe acute exacerbation.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3766709","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Yi-Cheng","surname":"Chen","email":"yichengliver@gmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chao-Wei","surname":"Hsu","email":"hsu2406@adm.cgmh.org.tw","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ming-Yang","surname":"Chang","email":"mingyc@adm.cgmh.org.tw","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chau-Ting","surname":"Yeh","email":"chautingy@gmail.com","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1002/hep.24109","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Tenofovir improves the outcome in patients with spontaneous reactivation of hepatitis B presenting as acute-on-chronic liver failure","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Jindal A, Kumar M, Sarin SK.

in the serum during the late incubation and clinical phases of the disease in humans.\n HBV replicates rapidly with minimally estimated doubling times ranging between 2.2 and 5.8 d (mean 3.7 ± 1.5 d).\n After a peak viral load in serum of nearly 1010 HBV DNA copies/ml is attained, clearance of HBV DNA follows a two or three phase decay pattern with an initial rapid decline characterized by mean half-life (t\n1/2) of 3.7 ± 1.2 d, similar to the t\n1/2 observed in the noncytolytic clearance of covalently closed circular DNA for other hepadnaviruses.\n The final phase of virion clearance occurs at a variable rate (t\n1/2 of 4.8 to 284 d) and may relate to the rate of loss of infected hepatocytes.\n Free virus has a mean t\n1/2 of at most 1.2 ± 0.6 d.\n We estimate a peak HBV production rate of at least 1013 virions/day and a maximum production rate of an infected hepatocyte of 200–1,000 virions/day, on average.\n At this peak rate of virion production we estimate that every possible single and most double mutations would be created each day.\n","id":"PMC2193367","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"The Rockefeller University Press","authors":[{"firstname":"Simon

biochemical breakthrough after 9 days, suggesting LMV resistance.\n Rescue therapy with ‘add-on’ tenofovir brought about a sustained improvement in biochemical, serological and virological markers

covalently closed circular DNA degradation or by inhibiting HBV entry or the expression of viral proteins.\n\n In addition, immunotherapeutic approaches may boost HBV-specific T-cell responses or stimulate the intrahepatic innate response.\n\n\nSummary\nThese new therapeutic approaches have mainly been tested in animal models.\n\n In humans, therapeutic strategies could be tailored to

of the large envelope protein is a key determinant for receptor(s) binding.\n However, the identity of the receptor(s) is unknown.\n Here, by using near zero distance photo-cross-linking and tandem affinity purification, we revealed that the receptor-binding region of pre-S1 specifically interacts with sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP), a multiple transmembrane transporter predominantly expressed in the liver.\n Silencing NTCP inhibited HBV and HDV infection, while exogenous NTCP expression rendered nonsusceptible hepatocarcinoma cells susceptible to these viral infections.\n Moreover, replacing amino acids 157–165 of nonfunctional monkey NTCP with the human counterpart conferred its ability in supporting both viral infections.\n Our results demonstrate that

B Virus Infection","abstract":"RNA interference (RNAi)-based therapeutics have the potential to treat chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in a fundamentally different manner than current therapies.\n Using RNAi, it is possible to knock down expression of viral RNAs including the pregenomic RNA from which the replicative intermediates are derived, thus reducing viral load, and the viral proteins that result in disease and impact the immune system's ability to eliminate the virus.\n We previously described the use of polymer-based Dynamic PolyConjugate (DPC) for the targeted delivery of siRNAs to hepatocytes.\n Here, we first show in proof-of-concept studies that simple coinjection of a hepatocyte-targeted, N-acetylgalactosamine-conjugated melittin-like peptide (NAG-MLP) with a liver-tropic cholesterol-conjugated siRNA (chol-siRNA) targeting coagulation factor VII (F7) results in efficient F7 knockdown in mice and nonhuman primates without changes in clinical chemistry or induction of cytokines.\n Using transient and transgenic mouse models of HBV infection, we show that a single coinjection of NAG-MLP with potent chol-siRNAs targeting conserved HBV sequences resulted in multilog repression of viral RNA, proteins, and viral DNA with long duration of effect.\n These results suggest that coinjection of NAG-MLP and chol-siHBVs holds great promise as a new therapeutic for patients chronically infected with HBV.\n","id":"PMC3666629","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing Group","authors":[{"firstname":"Christine

pathogens.\n To examine the immunological basis of this paradox we studied the ability of hepatocellularly expressed hepatitis B virus (HBV) to activate immunologically naïve HBV-specific CD8+ T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic T cells after adoptive transfer to HBV transgenic mice.\n Intrahepatic priming triggered vigorous in situ T cell proliferation but failed to induce interferon gamma production or cytolytic effector function.\n In contrast, the same T cells differentiated into cytolytic effector T cells in HBV transgenic mice if Programmed Death 1 (PD-1) expression was genetically ablated, suggesting that intrahepatic antigen presentation per se triggers negative regulatory signals that prevent the functional differentiation of naïve CD8+ T cells.\n Surprisingly, coadministration of an agonistic anti-CD40 antibody (?CD40) inhibited PD-1 induction and restored T cell effector function, thereby inhibiting viral gene expression and causing a necroinflammatory liver disease.\n Importantly, the depletion of myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) strongly diminished the ?CD40 mediated functional differentiation of HBV-specific CD8+ T cells, suggesting that activation of mDCs was responsible for the functional differentiation of HBV-specific CD8+ T cells in ?CD40 treated animals.\n These results demonstrate that antigen-specific, PD-1-mediated CD8+ T cell exhaustion can be rescued by CD40-mediated mDC-activation.\n","id":"PMC3708877","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

Activation of Innate Immune Cells in Human Liver","abstract":"The ability of innate immune cells to sense and respond to impending danger varies by anatomical location.\n The liver is considered tolerogenic but is still capable of mounting a successful immune response to clear various infections.\n To understand whether hepatic immune cells tune their response to different infectious challenges, we probed mononuclear cells purified from human healthy and diseased livers with distinct pathogen-associated molecules.\n We discovered that only the TLR8 agonist ssRNA40 selectively activated liver-resident innate immune cells to produce substantial quantities of IFN-?.\n We identified CD161Bright mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) and CD56Bright NK cells as the responding liver-resident innate immune cells.\n Their activation was not directly induced by the TLR8 agonist but was dependent on IL-12 and IL-18 production by ssRNA40-activated intrahepatic monocytes.\n Importantly, the ssRNA40-induced cytokine-dependent activation of MAIT cells mirrored responses induced by bacteria, i.\ne.\n, generating a selective production of high levels of IFN-?, without the concomitant production of TNF-? or IL-17A.\n The intrahepatic IFN-? production could be detected not only in healthy livers, but also in HBV- or HCV-infected livers.\n In conclusion, the human liver harbors a network of immune cells able to modulate their immunological responses to different pathogen-associated molecules.\n Their ability to generate a strong production of IFN-? upon stimulation with TLR8 agonist opens new therapeutic opportunities for the treatment of diverse liver pathologies.\n","id":"PMC4072808","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of
