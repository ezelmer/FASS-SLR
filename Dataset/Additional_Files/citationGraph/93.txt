World Health Organization estimates there have been over 25 million confirmed COVID-19 cases worldwide, with a mortality rate of approximately 4%, despite some differences across countries. Older individuals, those with preexisting respiratory or cardiovascular medical conditions, as well as those with diabetes and hypertension, appear to be at higher risk of severe complications and death. Available data suggest that hypertension is the most frequent comorbidity in patients with COVID-19, and it is associated with a more severe course of the disease and a higher mortality. However, sparse data are available on hypertensive COVID-19 patients, and the role played by anti-hypertensive medications is unclear. Since the SARS CoV-2 uses the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 to infect target cells, a controversial debate is ongoing about whether angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) should possibly be the reason for the emerging association between hypertension and worse outcomes in patients with COVID-19. On one hand, it has been speculated that both these medications could increase SARS CoV-2 infection susceptibility, and worsen the course of the respiratory syndromes. Indeed, in animal models and in humans it has been shown that ACEI and ARB may increase ACE2 levels in the lungs. On the other hand, other authors have hypothesised that an increased level of the soluble form of ACE2, secondary to ACEI/ARB treatment, may act as a competitive interceptor of SARS-CoV-2, thus slowing virus entry and protecting the lungs from injury. \nThree recently published studies in China reported that hypertensive patients hospitalised with COVID-19 experienced a lower risk of all-cause mortality if on treatment with ACEI/ARB compared to ACEI/ARB non-users. Moreover, latest reports showed no evidence that ACE inhibitors or ARB affected the risk of COVID-19 and did not confirm a harmful role of ACEI or ARB in admission to hospital or in-hospital death. \nAll the scientific societies have issued statements against any change in the current indications for the use of these medications in view of well documented beneficial effects. \nHence, the aim of the present study is to analyse the association between treatment with ACEI or ARB and in-hospital death and/or the need of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, among hypertensive patients hospitalised with COVID-19.\nMethods\nThis is a retrospective study conducted at the Fondazione Policlinico A.Gemelli IRCCS, Rome, Italy, an academic medical centre identified as one of the referral centre for COVID-19 in central Italy.\nStudy population\nWe derived data from the electronic medical records of all the patients consecutively admitted to our emergency department (ED) for suspected COVID-19, between 1 and 31 March 2020.\nWe identified all the patients with an established diagnosis of hypertension who have been continuously taking any oral antihypertensive medication for at least 3 months. All of the patients received a definitive diagnosis of COVID-19 as for the World Health Organization (WHO) interim guidance. In this respect, a definitive laboratory confirmation of SARS CoV-2 infection was defined as a positive result on real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay of nasal or oro-pharyngeal swab specimens. \nFrom the study, sample were excluded patients aged &lt;18 years, pregnant women and patients with a definitive diagnosis of COVID19 who were discharged home because of mild symptoms and a normal chest X-ray.\nData elements\nElectronic medical records were identified and the following data elements were derived: age, gender, clinical symptoms at presentation, Glasgow Coma Scale score, chest X-ray finding, and prior medical history including information on comorbid conditions and pharmacological treatment. The comorbid conditions considered were: heart disease, including a history of heart failure, coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, heart valve disease and arrhythmias; obesity, defined by a body mass index &gt;30; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); and diabetes. Furthermore, for each patient, at ED admission six physiological parameters were routinely recorded for the National Early Warning Score (NEWS) calculation: (i) respiratory rate; (ii) peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2); (iii) temperature; (iv) systolic blood pressure; (v) heart rate; and (vi) the level of consciousness assessed by the response on the AVPU (Alert, Voice, Pain, Unresponsive) scale. The NEWS scoring system, as described by the Royal College of Physicians, allows division of patients into the following three risk categories: low score (NEWS 0-4); medium score (NEWS 5-6); and high score (NEWS &gt;=7). \nAntihypertensive medications were classified into the following therapeutic classes: ACEI; ARB; mineralcorticoid receptor antagonists; beta-blockers; calcium channel blockers; alpha-1 adrenergic blockers; central alpha-adrenoceptor agonists; nitrates; and diuretics.\nFor the analysis, we compared patients on treatment with an ACEI/ARB (ACEI/ARB group), and patients on treatment without an ACEI/ARB (No-ACEI/ARB group).\nAll patients included in the analysis were treated according to the standard of care in the enrolling period, as defined by the Italian Society of Infectious and Tropical Diseases guidelines on the management of COVID-19. \nDegree of severity\nTo adjust for disease severity, we stratified patients based on the NEWS score at ED admission.\n ICU admission\nCriteria for ICU admission of COVID-19 patients were clearly established, did not change over the study period and they needed to be respected mandatorily. The criteria included the need for invasive respiratory support, the presence of extra-pulmonary organ failure, such as circulatory shock requiring vasopressors, or renal failure.\nDefinition of outcome variables\nThe end-points of the study were the all-cause in-hospital death and the combination of in-hospital death and need for ICU admission.\nStatistical analysis and sample size\nContinuous variables are reported as median (interquartile range) and are compared by univariate analysis using the Mann-Whitney U-test. Categorical variables are reported as absolute number (percentage) and are compared using the Chi-squared test (with Fisher's test if appropriate).\nVariables with a statistically significant association at the univariate analysis were entered into logistic regression multivariate models. Age, gender and ACEI/ARB treatment were forced into all the logistic models. As the NEWS score was included, the physiological parameters used for its calculation were excluded from the analysis to avoid estimation redundancy. As two variables were entered into each logistic regression model, a minimum number of 20 events would be needed for a correct parameter estimation. Therefore, our sample size was adequate for a correct estimation of both death and combined outcome of death/ICU admission.\nA P-value &lt;=0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Data were analysed by spss v25  (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA).\nStatement of ethics\nThis study was approved by the local Ethics Committee and it was performed in accordance with good clinical practice established in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments.\nResults\nBetween 1 and 31 March 2020, a total of 512 patients was admitted to the ED with a definitive diagnosis of COVID-19. One hundred and seventy-six patients were excluded from the analysis for insufficient clinical data on electronic medical record and two patients were excluded as they were already intubated at ED arrival. Among the 334 eligible patients, the final study sample included 166 hypertensive patients aged between 30 and 98 years, with the majority (66%) males (Fig. 1).\nFlow-chart of the cohort selection for the study.\nOverall, 49 (30%) patients were taking ACEI and 62 (37%) were taking ARB, and none of the patients was receiving both at the same time. Collectively, among the 111 patients in the ACEI/ARB group, 77 (70%) patients were taking one or more additional anti-hypertensive medications. The most common combinations were with beta-blockers (42 patients), diuretics (32 patients) and calcium antagonists (30 patients). Among patients in the no-ACEI/ARB group, 62% were taking more than one antihypertensive drug; the more common medications were calcium-antagonists (56.4%), beta-blockers (45.4%) and diuretics (16.4%).\nSample characteristics\nPatients in the ACEI/ARB group had comparable baseline characteristics, including comorbidities, with those in the no-ACEI/ARB group (Table 1). A NEWS score &gt;=2 was adjudicated for 53% of patients in the ACEI/ARB group, compared to 36% in the no-ACEI/ARB group, P &lt; 0.05 (Table 1).\nDemographic and clinical variables of hypertensive patients in the study cohort at emergency department admission\n	n (%)		 	Variable	All patients (n = 166)	ACEI/ARB (n = 111)	No-ACEI/ARB (n = 55)	P-value	 	Age, median (IQR) (years)	74 (65-82)	72 (66-81)	77 (65-82)	0.480	 	Male/female	109/57 (65.7/34.3)	78/33 (70.3/29.7)	31/24 (56.4/43.6)	0.076	 	Heart rate, median (IQR) (b.p.m.)	88 (78-101)	86 (77.3-100)	90 (85-106)	0.211	 	Respiratory rate, median (IQR) (breaths/min)	16 (14-20)	16 (13-20)	16 (15-20)	0.122	 	GCS, median (IQR)	15 (15-15)	15 (15-15)	15 (15-15)	0.647	 	Systolic BP, median (IQR) (mmHg)	130 (120-145)	130 (120-142)	130 (120-145)	0.655	 	Diastolic BP, median (IQR) (mmHg)	80 (67-84)	80 (64-85)	80 (73-83)	0.693	 	SpO2, median (IQR) (%)	94 (89-96)	94 (89-97)	94 (89-96)	0.745	 	Temperature, median (IQR)  ( C)	37.2 (36.2-37.7)	37.2 (36.2-37.7)	37.1 (36.3-37.7)	0.924	 	NEWS, median (IQR)	2 (1-4)	2 (1-4)	3 (0.5-4)	0.945	 	NEWS &gt;= 2	79 (47.6)	59 (53.2)	20 (36.4)	0.041	 	Comorbidities	 	Diabetes	22 (13.3)	18 (16.2)	4 (7.3)	0.110	 	COPD	9 (5.4)	5 (4.5)	4 (7.3)	0.458	 	Heart disease	70 (42.2)	48 (43.2)	22 (40)	0.690	 	Obesity	7 (4.2)	6 (5.4)	1 (1.8)	0.279	 	Outcomes					 	Death	29 (17.5)	20 (18.0)	9 (16.3)	0.792	 	Combined of death/admission to ICU	51 (30.7)	38 (34.2)	13 (23.6)	0.164	 	\nACEI, angiotensin converting enzymes inhibitors; ARB, angiotensin receptor blockers; BP, blood pressure; COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; GCS, Glasgow Coma Scale; ICU, intensive care unit; IQR, interquartile range; NEWS, National Early Warning Score; SpO2, peripheral oxygen saturation.\nOutcomes\nOverall, 29 (17%) patients died during the hospital stay, 6 patients in the first 24 h of hospital arrival.

(), ACEI; (), ARB.\nDiscussion\nThe main finding of the present study was that among patients with hypertension hospitalised for COVID-19, treatment with ACEI or ARB was not associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death. Moreover, no differences were highlighted between treatment with ACEI compared to ARB.\nInitial epidemiological reports from China have shown that hypertension and diabetes, as well as other cardiovascular diseases, are highly prevalent among COVID-19 patients. Among patients who experienced worse outcomes, including need for ICU admission, use of mechanical ventilation and death, the prevalence of hypertension was much higher compared to that of less severe COVID-19 patients. Likewise, in a study evaluating the prognosis of SARS CoV-2 patients admitted to ICU, the prevalence of hypertension was higher among patients who died compared to that of patients who could be stabilised and discharged from the ICU. In addition, an analysis of the characteristics of COVID-19 related deaths in Italy documented that 73% of the patients (mean age 79 years) had an established diagnosis of hypertension, and 30 and 17% respectively, reported a treatment with ACEI or ARB. \nCollectively, these evidences have suggested a link between hypertension and the severity of COVID-19 infection. Furthermore, a growing concern has developed that the use of antihypertensive medications, mainly ACEI and ARB, may have contributed to the adverse outcomes observed in the initial studies of COVID-19 patients. \nIndeed, since SARS-CoV2 binds to ACE2 receptor to infect host cells, it has been hypothesised that ACEI and ARB could upregulate ACE2 expression leading to an increased susceptibility to viral entry and propagation. Furthermore, it has been postulated that the up-regulation of ACE2 could increase the lung viral load and worsen the respiratory disease severity. \nHowever, recent studies did not confirm these concerns. Yang et al., conducted a retrospective study including 126 COVID-19 patients with hypertension of whom 43 (34%) patients were on ACEI or ARB treatment. Compared to ACEI/ARB non-users, those on ACEI or ARB experienced a lower death rate but failed to reach statistical significance. Another Chinese study on 362 hypertensive patients with COVID-19, of whom 115 (32%) were on ACEI or ARB, suggested that these medications were not associated with COVID-19 severity or mortality. Furthermore, Zhang et al. had recently published a retrospective multi-centre study in China including 1128 hypertensive adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19. One hundred and eighty-eight (17%) patients using ACEI/ARB were paired at 1:1 based on a propensity matching with patients using other anti-hypertensive medications. Use of ACEI/ARB was associated with a lower risk of COVID-19 mortality at 28 days, albeit the authors themselves admit that residual confounding cannot be ruled out. More recently, a large population-based study conducted in Italy did not provide evidences that ACEI or ARB could affect the risk of COVID-19 infection. \nIn this study, we did not find an association between treatment with ACEI or ARB and the in-hospital death (Fig. 1). Similarly, a case-population study done in Spain showed that there is no evidence of a causal relationship between ACE2 levels and outcomes in COVID-19 patients, nor is it known conclusively if a higher viral load is associated with a worse prognosis in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, ACEI or ARB did not increase the risk of COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital. \nThe findings of our study failed to demonstrate that patients on ACEI/ARB could experience a higher risk of the combined end-point of in-hospital death and ICU admission suggesting that ACEI or ARB treatment did not influence only the risk of death, but also the course of disease. Furthermore, we could not document any differential impact on the outcomes between ACEI and ARB (Fig. 2) but, due the relatively small sample size, this finding remains questionable. Indeed, the evidence prior to the COVID-19 era was mixed. A systematic review has indicated that ACEI, but not ARB, have a protective role towards the risk of community-acquired pneumonia and its related mortality. In contrast, among patients with COPD, it has been suggested that ARB might be more effective than ACEI to reduce the severity and mortality due to COPD. \nMoreover, in our cohort of COVID-19 patients, among the comorbidities analysed, a history of COPD showed a higher prevalence among non-survivor patients. Likewise, in a recent meta-analysis, COVID-19 infection was associated with substantial severity and mortality rates in patients with COPD. In addition, although in a limited sample, the present data suggest that the risk of death could be age-dependent, confirming what is stated in other surveys. However, no sufficient data were available to demonstrate the independent role of age. Indeed, in a previous report, mortality appeared not predicted by advanced age. \nTypically, COVID-19 patients present with fever, myalgia or fatigue and dry cough. Severe cases progress to severe dyspnoea and hypoxaemia usually within 1 week after the onset of symptoms. In hospitalised COVID-19 patients, the prevalence of hypoxaemic respiratory failure is approximately 20%, and more than 25% may require intensive care treatment. In the present study, we elected to focus on the worse case scenario, for example, death or the composite of death/ICU admission during hospital stay. In order to account for the different clinical severity at presentation, patients were stratified according to NEWS, a widely adopted early warning score. The NEWS score is based on a rapid and quantitative assessment of changes in vital signs, and was developed to identify and track patients at risk of deterioration in non-critical areas of the hospital in order to ensure an early stabilisation and ICU transfer and to prevent avoidable cardiac arrest. In recent years, the NEWS score has been validated in the ED setting to predict ICU admission and mortality. Furthermore, although not yet validated, the NEWS score has recently been proposed for the triage of COVID-19 patients in ED. The findings of our study document that patients with a more severe degree of respiratory illness, defined by a NEWS score &gt;=2 at presentation, were at high risk of rapid deterioration, with a consistent increased risk of death and death/ICU admission.\nThese results are consistent with those reported in a recent prospective cohort study in which the NEWS score at hospital admission appeared superior to the quick Sepsis-Related Organ Failure Assessment score and other widely used clinical risk scores in prediction of severe disease and in-hospital mortality from COVID-19. However, larger studies are needed to confirm this finding, and to investigate the optimal cut-off value for clinical use.\nAs for any retrospective study, several limitations are worth considering. First, despite a fair sample size, the number of events was small thus limiting the power of our study. The study was conducted at a single medical centre and, as such, the findings might be not representative of the general population of COVID-19 patients. The study focussed on the worse case scenarios, that is, in-hospital death or death/ICU admission. For this reason, we cannot extrapolate the findings to different outcomes as length of hospital stay, other complications, permanent need of oxygen support, loss of autonomy or need to transfer to residential nursing facilities. Similarly, the effect of ACEI/ARB might be different among patients managed in the outpatient setting. Finally, some patients might have been excluded from the analytical sample because it was suggested to interrupt ACEI/ARB treatment due to prior concerns.\nConclusions\nAmong patients with hypertension hospitalised for COVID-19, treatment with ACEI or ARB was not associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death. Moreover, noticeably, no differences were documented between treatment with ACEI compared to ARB.\nReferences\nRenin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors in patients with Covid-19\nAre patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus at increased risk for COVID-19 infection?\nPreventing a COVID-19 pandemic: ACE inhibitors as a potential risk factor for fatal COVID-19\nCan angiotensin receptor-blocking drugs perhaps be harmful in the COVID-19 pandemic?\nClinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China\nRisk factors associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome and death in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia in Wuhan, China\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and cardiovascular disease: a viewpoint on the potential influence of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers on onset and severity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection\nBaseline characteristics and outcomes of 1591 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 admitted to ICUs of the Lombardy region, Italy\nAssociation of inpatient use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers with mortality among patients with hypertension hospitalized with COVID-19\nAssociation of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors with severity or risk of death in patients with hypertension hospitalized for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection in Wuhan, China\nEffects of ARBs and ACEIs on virus infection, inflammatory status and clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients with hypertension: a single center retrospective study\nSARS-CoV-2 cell entry depends on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and is blocked by a clinically proven protease inhibitor\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): do angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers have a biphasic effect?\nCOVID-19 and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers.

By extracting and analyzing all available published clinical data, we identified several major clinical characteristics associated with increased disease severity and mortality among patients with COVID-19. Specifically, preexisting chronic conditions such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes are strongly associated with an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19; surprisingly, however, we found no correlation between chronic liver disease and increased disease severity.\n In addition, we found that both acute cardiac injury and acute kidney injury are highly correlated with an increased risk of COVID-19-related mortality.\n Given the high risk of comorbidity and the high mortality rate associated with tissue damage, organ function should be monitored closely in patients diagnosed with COVID-19, and this approach should be included when establishing new guidelines for managing these high-risk patients.\n Moreover, additional clinical data are needed in order to determine whether a supportive therapy can help mitigate the development of severe, potentially fatal complications, and further studies are needed to identify the pathophysiology and the mechanism underlying this novel coronavirus-associated infectious disease.\n Taken together, these findings provide new insights regarding clinical strategies for improving the management and outcome of patients with COVID-19.","id":"PMC7187729","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"AAAS","authors":[{"firstname":"Xinhui","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xuexian","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Xuexian","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhaoxian","surname":"Cai","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Zhaoxian","surname":"Cai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaotian","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiaotong","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Xiaotong","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Junxia","surname":"Min","email":"junxiamin@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Junxia","surname":"Min","email":"junxiamin@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fudi","surname":"Wang","email":"fwang@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Fudi","surname":"Wang","email":"fwang@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2002032","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China","abstract":"Background\nSince December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on

2019 (Covid-19) has not been well studied.\n\n\nMethods\nWe carried out a population-based case–control study in the Lombardy region of Italy.\n\n A total of 6272 case patients in whom infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was confirmed between February 21 and March 11, 2020, were matched to 30,759 beneficiaries of the Regional Health Service (controls) according to sex, age, and municipality of residence.\n\n Information about the use of selected drugs and patients’ clinical profiles was obtained from regional databases of health care use.\n\n Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for associations between drugs and infection, with adjustment for confounders, were estimated by means of logistic regression.\n\n\nResults\nAmong both case patients and controls, the mean (±SD) age was 68±13 years, and 37% were women.\n\n The use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs was more common among case patients than among controls, as was the use of other antihypertensive and non-antihypertensive drugs, and case patients had a worse clinical profile.\n\n Use of ARBs or ACE inhibitors did not show any association with Covid-19 among case patients overall (adjusted odds ratio, 0.95 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.86 to 1.05] for ARBs and 0.96 [95% CI, 0.87 to 1.07] for ACE inhibitors) or among patients who had a severe or fatal course of the disease (adjusted odds ratio, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.63 to 1.10] for ARBs and 0.91 [95% CI, 0.69 to 1.21] for ACE inhibitors), and no association between these variables was found according to sex.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn this large, population-based study, the use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs was more frequent among patients with Covid-19 than among controls because of their higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease.\n\n However, there was no evidence that ACE inhibitors or ARBs affected the risk of COVID-19.\n","id":"PMC7206933","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical

inhibitors might influence the severity of COVID-19. We aimed to evaluate whether continuing versus discontinuing renin–angiotensin system inhibitors (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers) affects outcomes in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19.\nMethods\nThe REPLACE COVID trial was a prospective, randomised, open-label trial done at 20 large referral hospitals in seven countries worldwide.\n\n Eligible participants were aged 18 years and older who were admitted to hospital with COVID-19 and were receiving a renin–angiotensin system inhibitor before admission.\n\n Individuals with contraindications to continuation or discontinuation of renin–angiotensin system inhibitor therapy were excluded.\n\n Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to continuation or discontinuation of their renin–angiotensin system inhibitor using permuted block randomisation, with allocation concealed using a secure web-based randomisation system.\n\n The primary outcome was a global rank score in which participants were ranked across four hierarchical tiers incorporating time to death, duration of mechanical ventilation, time on renal replacement or vasopressor therapy, and multiorgan dysfunction during the hospitalisation.\n\n Primary analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population.\n\n The REPLACE COVID trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.\n\ngov, NCT04338009.\n\n\nFindings\nBetween March 31 and Aug 20, 2020, 152 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to either continue or discontinue renin–angiotensin system inhibitor therapy (continuation group n=75; discontinuation group n=77).\n\n Mean age of participants was 62 years (SD 12), 68 (45%) were female, mean body-mass index was 33 kg/m2 (SD 8), and 79 (52%) had diabetes.\n\n Compared with discontinuation of renin–angiotensin system inhibitors, continuation had no effect on the global rank score (median rank 73 [IQR 40–110] for continuation vs 81 [38–117] for discontinuation; ?-coefficient 8 [95% CI ?13 to 29]).\n\n There were 16 (21%) of 75 participants in the continuation arm versus 14 (18%) of 77 in the discontinuation arm who required intensive care unit admission or invasive mechanical ventilation, and 11 (15%) of 75 participants in the continuation group versus ten (13%) of 77 in the discontinuation group died.\n\n 29 (39%) participants in the continuation group and 28 (36%) participants in the discontinuation group had at least one adverse event (?2 test of adverse events between treatment groups p=0·77).\n\n There was no difference in blood pressure, serum potassium, or creatinine during follow-up across the two groups.\n\n\nInterpretation\nConsistent with international society recommendations, renin–angiotensin system inhibitors can be safely continued in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19.\nFunding\nREPLACE COVID Investigators, REPLACE COVID Trial Social Fundraising Campaign, and

enzyme 2, which can be upregulated by inhibitors of the renin–angiotensin system (RAS).\n\n We aimed to test our hypothesis that discontinuation of chronic treatment with ACE-inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) mitigates the course o\f recent-onset COVID-19.\nMethods\nACEI-COVID was a parallel group, randomised, controlled, open-label trial done at 35 centres in Austria and Germany.\n\n Patients aged 18 years and older were enrolled if they presented with recent symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and were chronically treated with ACEIs or ARBs.\n\n Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to discontinuation or continuation of RAS inhibition for 30 days.\n\n Primary outcome was the maximum sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score within 30 days, where death was scored with the maximum achievable SOFA score.\n\n Secondary endpoints were area under the death-adjusted SOFA score (AUCSOFA), mean SOFA score, admission to the intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, and death.\n\n Analyses were done on a modified intention-to-treat basis.\n\n This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.\n\ngov, NCT04353596.\n\n\nFindings\nBetween April 20, 2020, and Jan 20, 2021, 204 patients (median age 75 years [IQR 66–80], 37% females) were randomly assigned to discontinue (n=104) or continue (n=100) RAS inhibition.\n\n Within 30 days, eight (8%) of 104 died in the discontinuation group and 12 (12%) of 100 patients died in the continuation group (p=0·42).\n\n There was no significant difference in the primary endpoint between the discontinuation and continuation group (median [IQR] maximum SOFA score 0·00 (0·00–2·00) vs 1·00 (0·00–3·00); p=0·12).\n\n Discontinuation was associated with a significantly lower AUCSOFA (0·00 [0·00–9·25] vs 3·50 [0·00–23·50]; p=0·040), mean SOFA score (0·00 [0·00–0·31] vs 0·12 [0·00–0·78]; p=0·040), and 30-day SOFA score (0·00 [10–90th percentile, 0·00–1·20] vs 0·00 [0·00–24·00]; p=0·023).\n\n At 30 days, 11 (11%) in the discontinuation group and 23 (23%) in the continuation group had signs of organ dysfunction (SOFA score ?1) or were dead (p=0·017).\n\n There were no significant differences for mechanical ventilation (10 (10%) vs 8 (8%), p=0·87) and admission to intensive care unit (20 [19%] vs 18 [18%], p=0·96) between the discontinuation and continuation

Using data from 228,722 Veterans with a history of hypertension who received COVID-19 testing at the VA, we investigated whether the use of ACEI or ARB over the two years prior to the index date was associated with increased odds of (1) a positive COVID-19 test, and (2) a severe outcome (hospitalization, mortality, and use of intensive care unit (ICU) and/or mechanical ventilation) among COVID-19-positive patients.\n\n We used logistic regression with and without propensity score weighting (PSW) to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for the association between ACEI/ARB use and a positive COVID-19 test result.\n\n The association between medication use and COVID-19 outcome severity was examined using multinomial logistic regression comparing participants who were not hospitalized to participants who were hospitalized, were admitted to the ICU, used a mechanical ventilator, or died.\n\n All models were adjusted for relevant covariates, including demographics (age, sex, race, ethnicity), selected comorbidities, and the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI).\n\n\nResults\nThe use of ACEI significantly decreased the odds of a positive COVID-19 test among Veterans with hypertension (OR = 0.917, (0.887, 0.948) and OR = 0.926, (0.894, 0.958) with PSW).\n\n The use of ACEI, but not of ARB, was also associated with significantly increased odds of using mechanical ventilators (OR = 1.265, (1.010, 1.584) and OR = 1.210, (1.053, 1.39) with PSW) among all COVID-19 inpatients compared to outpatients.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn this study of Veterans with hypertension, ACEI was significantly associated with decreased odds of testing positive for COVID-19.

city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

mortality in critical illness: an observational cohort study","abstract":"Introduction\nThe neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a biological marker that has been shown to be associated with outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.\n\n Increasing quartile of NLR was statistically significantly associated with secondary outcome.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR is associated with outcomes in unselected critically ill patients.\n\n In patients with sepsis, there was no statistically significant relationship between NLR and mortality.\n\n Further investigation is required to increase understanding of the pathophysiology of this relationship and to validate these findings with data collected prospectively.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article

a major threat to public health1–3.\n Despite intense research efforts, how, when and where new diseases appear are still a source of considerable uncertainty.\n A severe respiratory disease was recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like

municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days

factors for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID?19) and the possible mechanisms.\n ACE2 is a crucial component of the renin?angiotensin system (RAS).\n The classical RAS ACE?Ang II?AT1R regulatory axis and the ACE2?Ang 1?7?MasR counter?regulatory axis play an essential role in maintaining homeostasis in humans.\n ACE2 is widely distributed in the heart, kidneys, lungs, and testes.\n ACE2 antagonizes the activation of the classical RAS system and protects against organ damage, protecting against hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.\n Similar to SARS?CoV, SARS?CoV?2 also uses the ACE2 receptor to invade human alveolar epithelial cells.\n Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a clinical high?mortality disease, and ACE2 has a protective effect on this type of acute lung injury.\n Current research shows that the poor prognosis of patients with COVID?19 is related to factors such as sex (male), age (&gt;60 years), underlying diseases (hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease), secondary ARDS, and other relevant factors.\n Because of these protective effects of ACE2 on chronic underlying diseases and ARDS, the development of spike protein?based vaccine and drugs enhancing ACE2 activity may become one of the most promising approaches for the treatment of COVID?19 in the future.\n","id":"PMC7317908","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley and Sons

tissues from patients with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer (PC) using new approach- ACE phenotyping, that includes evaluation of: 1) ACE activity with two substrates (HHL and ZPHL); 2) the ratio of the rates of their hydrolysis (ZPHL/HHL ratio); 3) the ratio of immunoreactive ACE protein to ACE activity; 4) the pattern of mAbs binding to different epitopes on ACE – ACE conformational fingerprint - to reveal conformational changes in prostate ACE due to prostate pathology.\n ACE activity dramatically decreased and the ratio of immunoreactive ACE protein to ACE activity increased in PC tissues.\n The catalytic parameter, ZPHL/HHL ratio, increased in prostate tissues from all patients with PC, but was did not change for most |BPH patients.\n Nevertheless, prostate tissues of several patients diagnosed with BPH based on histology, also demonstrated decreased ACE activity and increased immunoreactive ACE protein/ACE activity and ZPHL/HHL ratios, that could be considered as more early indicators of prostate cancer development than routine histology.\n Thus, ACE phenotyping of prostate biopsies has a potential to be an effective approach for early

mechanisms and applications","abstract":"Viral and bacterial infections are involved in the development of human cancers, such as liver, nasopharyngeal, cervical, head and neck, and gastric cancers.\n Aberrant DNA methylation is frequently present in these cancers, and some of the aberrantly methylated genes are causally involved in cancer development and progression.\n Notably, aberrant DNA methylation can be present even in non-cancerous or precancerous tissues, and its levels correlate with the risk of cancer development, producing a so-called ‘epigenetic field for cancerization’.\n Mechanistically, most viral or bacterial infections induce DNA methylation indirectly via chronic inflammation, but recent studies have indicated that some viruses have direct effects on the epigenetic machinery of host cells.\n From a translational viewpoint, a recent multicenter prospective cohort study demonstrated that assessment of the extent of alterations in DNA methylation in non-cancerous tissues can be used to predict cancer risk.\n Furthermore, suppression of aberrant DNA methylation was shown to be a useful strategy for cancer prevention in an animal model.\n Here, we review the involvement of aberrant DNA methylation in various types of infection-associated cancers, along with individual induction mechanisms, and we discuss the application of these findings for cancer prevention, diagnosis, and therapy.\n","id":"PMC4731931","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

Might the Double X-Chromosome in Females Be Protective against SARS-CoV-2 Compared to the Single X-Chromosome in Males?","abstract":"In December 2019, a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) from a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was recognized in the city of Wuhan, China.\n Rapidly, it became an epidemic in China and has now spread throughout the world reaching pandemic proportions.\n High mortality rates characterize SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19), which mainly affects the elderly, causing unrestrained cytokines-storm and subsequent pulmonary shutdown, also suspected micro thromboembolism events.\n At the present time, no specific and dedicated treatments, nor approved vaccines, are available, though very promising data come from the use of anti-inflammatory, anti-malaria, and anti-coagulant drugs.\n In addition, it seems that males are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 than females, with males 65% more likely to die from the infection than females.\n Data from the World Health Organization (WHO) and Chinese scientists show that of all cases about 1.7% of women who contract the virus will die compared with 2.8% of men, and data from Hong Kong hospitals state that 32% of male and 15% of female COVID-19 patients required intensive care or died.\n On the other hand, the long-term fallout of coronavirus may be worse for women than for men due to social and psychosocial reasons.\n Regardless of sex- or gender-biased data obtained from WHO and those gathered from sometimes controversial scientific journals, some central points should be considered.\n Firstly, SARS-CoV-2 has a strong interaction with the human ACE2 receptor, which plays an essential role in cell entry together with transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2); it is interesting to note that the ACE2 gene lays on the X-chromosome, thus allowing females to be potentially heterozygous and differently assorted compared to men who are definitely hemizygous.\n Secondly, the higher ACE2 expression rate in females, though controversial, might ascribe them the worst prognosis, in contrast with worldwide epidemiological data.\n Finally, several genes involved in inflammation are located on the X-chromosome, which also contains high number of immune-related genes responsible for innate and adaptive immune responses to infection.\n Other genes, out from the RAS-pathway, might directly or indirectly impact on the ACE1/ACE2 balance by influencing its main actors (e.\ng.\n, ABO locus, SRY, SOX3, ADAM17).\n Unexpectedly, the higher levels of ACE2 or ACE1/ACE2 rebalancing might improve the outcome of COVID-19 in both sexes by reducing inflammation, thrombosis, and death.\n Moreover, X-heterozygous females might also activate a mosaic advantage and show more pronounced sex-related differences resulting in a sex dimorphism, further favoring them in counteracting the progression of the SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n","id":"PMC7278991","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"Donato","surname":"Gemmati","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Barbara","surname":"Bramanti","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Barbara","surname":"Bramanti","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Maria

presence of ACE insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism to COVID-19 incidence and mortality.\n\n Furthermore, COVID-19 prevalence correlated to allele frequency of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) deletion (D) polymorphism within the European population.\n\n\nObjective\nid='Par2'>Homozygous ACE deletion polymorphism is associated with increase in ACE and angiotensin II (Ang-II), sustained levels can result in inflammation, fibrosis and organ damage.\n\n The ACE DD polymorphism is also associated with hypertension, acute respiratory distress and diabetic nephropathy, all considered high risk for COVID-19 infection and outcomes.\n\n The study objective was to describe a biological framework associating ethnic prevalence of ACE deletion polymorphism to COVID-19 comorbidities providing rationale for therapeutic utility of ACE-I/ARBs to improve outcomes.\n\n\nMethod and Results\nid='Par3'>The Allele Frequency Database (ALFRED) was queried for frequency of rs4646994 representing ACE I/D polymorphism.\n\n In a total of 349 worldwide population samples, frequency of ACE D allele was higher in European, Asian, and Africans cohorts.\n\n In the USA, the frequency of ACE D allele was higher in non-Hispanic Black compared with non-Hispanic White and Mexican Americans.\n\n\nConclusion\nid='Par4'>COVID-19 binding mediated reduction/inactivation of ACE-II can increase ACE/Ang-II signalling pathway and related pathologies.\n\n The presence of ACE DD polymorphism with COVID-19 infection likely augments ACE/Ang-II activities, increasing severity of COVID-19 morbidities and impacts outcomes.\n\n Thus, ethnic prevalence of ACE DD polymorphism can explain in part the severity of COVID-19 morbidity providing rationale for the use of ACE-I/ARBs to improve outcomes.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7478439","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Springer International

are the primarily chosen drugs to treat heart failure and hypertension.\n Moreover, an imbalance in tissue ACE/ACE2 activity is implicated in COVID-19. In the present study, we tested the relationships between circulating and tissue (lung and heart) ACE levels in men.\n Methods: Serum, lung (n = 91) and heart (n = 72) tissue samples were collected from Caucasian patients undergoing lung surgery or heart transplantation.\n ACE I/D genotype, ACE concentration and ACE activity were determined from serum and tissue samples.\n Clinical parameters were also recorded.\n Results: A protocol for ACE extraction was developed for tissue ACE measurements.\n Extraction of tissue-localized ACE was optimal in a 0.3% Triton-X-100 containing buffer, resulting in 260 ± 12% higher ACE activity over detergent-free conditions.\n SDS or higher Triton-X-100 concentrations inhibited the ACE activity.\n Serum ACE concentration correlated with ACE I/D genotype (II: 166 ± 143 ng/mL, n = 19, ID: 198 ± 113 ng/mL, n = 44 and DD: 258 ± 109 ng/mL, n = 28, p &lt; 0.05) as expected.\n In contrast, ACE expression levels in the lung tissue were approximately

Perspectives in the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS) I: Endogenous Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibition","abstract":"Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors represent the fifth most often prescribed drugs.\n ACE inhibitors decrease 5-year mortality by approximately one-fifth in cardiovascular patients.\n Surprisingly, there are reports dating back to 1979 suggesting the existence of endogenous ACE inhibitors, which endogenous inhibitory effects are much less characterized than that for the clinically administered ACE inhibitors.\n Here we aimed to investigate this endogenous ACE inhibition in human sera.\n It was hypothesized that ACE activity is masked by an endogenous inhibitor, which dissociates from the ACE when its concentration decreases upon dilution.\n ACE activity was measured by FAPGG hydrolysis first.\n The specific (dilution corrected) enzyme activities significantly increased by dilution of human serum samples (23.2±0.7 U/L at 4-fold dilution, 51.4±0.3 U/L at 32-fold dilution, n?=?3, p?=?0.001), suggesting the presence of an endogenous inhibitor.\n In accordance, specific enzyme activities did not changed by dilution when purified renal ACE was used, where no endogenous inhibitor was present (655±145 U/L, 605±42 U/L, n?=?3, p?=?0.715, respectively).\n FAPGG conversion strongly correlated with angiotensin I conversion suggesting that this feature is not related to the artificial substrate.\n Serum samples were ultra-filtered to separate ACE (MW: 180 kDa) and the hypothesized inhibitor.\n Filtering through 50 kDa filters was without effect, while filtering through 100 kDa filters eliminated the inhibiting factor (ACE activity after &lt;100 kDa filtering: 56.4±2.4 U/L, n?=?4, control: 26.4±0.7 U/L, n?=?4, p&lt;0.001).\n Lineweaver-Burk plot indicated non-competitive inhibition of ACE by this endogenous factor.\n The endogenous inhibitor had higher potency on the C-terminal active site than N-terminal active site of ACE.\n Finally, this endogenous ACE inhibition was also present in mouse, donkey, goat, bovine sera besides men (increasing of specific ACE activity from 4-fold to 32-fold dilution: 2.8-fold, 1.7-fold, 1.5-fold, 1.8-fold, 2.6-fold, respectively).\n We report here the existence of an evolutionary conserved mechanism suppressing circulating ACE activity, in vivo, similarly to ACE inhibitory drugs.\n","id":"PMC3972180","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

in human cells depends on angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, which can be upregulated by inhibitors of the renin–angiotensin system (RAS).\n\n We aimed to test our hypothesis that discontinuation of chronic treatment with ACE-inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) mitigates the course o\f recent-onset COVID-19.\nMethods\nACEI-COVID was a parallel group, randomised, controlled, open-label trial done at 35 centres in Austria and Germany.\n\n Patients aged 18 years and older were enrolled if they presented with recent symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and were chronically treated with ACEIs or ARBs.\n\n Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to discontinuation or continuation of RAS inhibition for 30 days.\n\n Primary outcome was the maximum sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score within 30 days, where death was scored with the maximum achievable SOFA score.\n\n Secondary endpoints were area under the death-adjusted SOFA score (AUCSOFA), mean SOFA score, admission to the intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, and death.\n\n Analyses were done on a modified intention-to-treat basis.\n\n This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.\n\ngov, NCT04353596.\n\n\nFindings\nBetween April 20, 2020, and Jan 20, 2021, 204 patients (median age 75 years [IQR 66–80], 37% females) were randomly assigned to discontinue (n=104) or continue (n=100) RAS inhibition.\n\n Within 30 days, eight (8%) of 104 died in the discontinuation group and 12 (12%) of 100 patients died in the continuation group (p=0·42).\n\n There was no significant difference in the primary endpoint between the discontinuation and continuation group (median [IQR] maximum SOFA score 0·00 (0·00–2·00) vs 1·00 (0·00–3·00); p=0·12).\n\n Discontinuation was associated with a significantly lower AUCSOFA (0·00 [0·00–9·25] vs 3·50 [0·00–23·50]; p=0·040), mean SOFA score (0·00 [0·00–0·31] vs 0·12 [0·00–0·78]; p=0·040), and 30-day SOFA score (0·00 [10–90th percentile, 0·00–1·20] vs 0·00 [0·00–24·00]; p=0·023).\n\n At 30 days, 11 (11%) in the discontinuation group and 23 (23%) in the continuation group had signs of organ dysfunction (SOFA score ?1) or were dead (p=0·017).\n\n There were no significant differences for mechanical ventilation (10 (10%) vs 8 (8%), p=0·87) and admission to intensive care unit (20 [19%] vs 18 [18%], p=0·96) between the discontinuation and continuation group.\n\n\nInterpretation\nDiscontinuation of RAS-inhibition in COVID-19 had no significant effect on the maximum severity of COVID-19 but may lead to a faster and better recovery.\n\n The decision to continue or discontinue should be made on an individual basis, considering the risk profile, the indication for RAS inhibition, and the availability of alternative therapies and outpatient monitoring options.\n\n\nFunding\nAustrian Science Fund and German Center for Cardiovascular

The Renin Angiotensin System (RAS) seems to be involved in COVID-19 natural course, since studies suggest the membrane-bound Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) works as SARS-CoV-2 cellular receptor.\n Besides the efforts of the scientific community to understand the virus’ molecular interactions with human cells, few studies summarize what has been so far discovered about SARS-CoV-2 signaling mechanisms and its interactions with RAS molecules.\n This review aims to discuss possible SARS-CoV-2 intracellular signaling pathways, cell entry mechanism and the possible consequences of the interaction with RAS components, including Angiotensin II (Ang II), Angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)], Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), ACE2, Angiotensin II receptor type-1 (AT1), and Mas Receptor.\n We also discuss ongoing clinical trials and treatment based on RAS cascade intervention.\n Data were obtained independently by the two authors who carried out a search in the PubMed, Embase, LILACS, Cochrane, Scopus, SciELO and the National Institute of Health databases using Medical Subject Heading terms as “SARS-CoV-2,” “COVID-19,” “Renin Angiotensin System,” “ACE2,” “Angiotensin II,” “Angiotensin-(1-7),” and “AT1 receptor.\n” Similarly to other members of Coronaviridae family, the molecular interactions between the pathogen and the membrane-bound ACE2 are based on the cleavage of the spike glycoprotein (S) in two subunits.\n Following the binding of the S1 receptor-binding domain (RBD) to ACE2, transmembrane protease/serine subfamily 2 (TMPRSS2) cleaves the S2 domain to facilitate membrane fusion.\n It is very likely that SARS-CoV-2 cell entry results in downregulation of membrane-bound ACE2, an enzyme that converts Ang II into Ang-(1-7).\n This mechanism can result in lung injury and vasoconstriction.\n In addition, Ang II activates pro-inflammatory cascades when binding to the AT1 Receptor.\n On the other hand, Ang-(1-7) promotes anti-inflammatory effects through its interactions with the Mas Receptor.\n These molecules might be possible therapeutic targets for treating COVID-19. Thus, the understanding of SARS-CoV-2 intracellular pathways and interactions with the RAS may clarify COVID-19 physiopathology and open perspectives for new treatments and strategies.\n","id":"PMC7525006","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Frontiers Media S.A.","authors":[{"firstname":"Larissa Braga","surname":"Costa","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lucas Giandoni","surname":"Perez","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Vitória Andrade","surname":"Palmeira","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Thiago","surname":"Macedo e Cordeiro","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Victor Teatini","surname":"Ribeiro","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Katharina","surname":"Lanza","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Ana Cristina","surname":"Simões e Silva","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"}]},{"doi":"10.1002/jmv.27144","date":"2021-06-14","title":"Soluble angiotensin?converting enzyme 2 is transiently elevated in COVID?19 and correlates with specific inflammatory and endothelial markers","abstract":"The main entry receptor of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS?CoV?2) is angiotensin?converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).\n SARS?CoV?2 interactions with ACE2 may increase ectodomain shedding but consequences for the renin?angiotensin system and pathology in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID?19) remain unclear.\n We measured soluble ACE2 (sACE2) and sACE levels by enzyme?linked immunosorbent assay in 114 hospital?treated COVID?19 patients compared with 10 healthy controls; follow?up samples after four months were analyzed for 58 patients.\n Associations between sACE2 respectively sACE and risk factors for severe COVID?19, outcome, and inflammatory markers were investigated.\n Levels of sACE2 were higher in COVID?19 patients than in healthy controls, median 5.0 (interquartile range 2.8–11.8)?ng/ml versus 1.4 (1.1–1.6)?ng/ml, p?&lt;?.\n0001. sACE2 was higher in men than women but was not affected by other risk factors for severe COVID?19. sACE2 decreased to 2.3 (1.6–3.9)?ng/ml at follow?up, p?&lt;?.\n0001, but remained higher than in healthy controls, p?=?.\n012. sACE was marginally lower during COVID?19 compared with at follow?up, 57 (45–70)?ng/ml versus 72 (52–87)?ng/ml, p?=?.\n008.

macrovascular complications, and medications in the two groups.\n\n Independent associates of mortality were analyzed using multivariable analysis on the whole T2DM population.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>A total of 33,478 patients with T2DM who tested postive for COVID-19 who met the inclusion criteria were included in the analysis.\n\n Median (interquartile range) age was 54 (22) years and 42.4% were male.\n\n Of these, 9100 patients using DPP-4is (n?=?4550) or other glucose-lowering drugs (n?=?4550) were matched in two groups.\n\n After matching, analysis revealed a lower mortality in the DPP-4i group (9.5 vs.\n\n 11.8%; p?&lt;?0.001).\n\n In the multivariable model, the use of DPP-4is (odds ratio [OR] 0.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.35–0.91; p?=?0.02) was associated with lower mortality in the whole sample, while age, male gender, computed tomography finding of COVID-19, obesity, low glomerular filtration rate, and an insulin-based regimen also predicted increased risk of death.\n\n There was no association between the preexisting treatment with DPP-4is and COVID-19-related hospitalization in the matched analysis or multivariate model.\n\n The rate of admission to the intensive care unit and/or mechanical ventilation favored the DPP-4i group (21.7 vs.\n\n 25.2%; p?=?0.001), although this association became saturated in the multivariate analysis (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.39–1.08; p?=?0.099).\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par4'>The results of this study demonstrate an association between DDP-4i use and reduced mortality in people with

course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

therapeutics","abstract":"At the time of writing this commentary (February 2020), the coronavirus COVID?19 epidemic has already resulted in more fatalities compared with the SARS and MERS coronavirus epidemics combined.\n Therapeutics that may assist to contain its rapid spread and reduce its high mortality rates are urgently needed.\n Developing vaccines against the SARS?CoV?2 virus may take many months.\n Moreover, vaccines based on viral?encoded peptides may not be effective against future coronavirus epidemics, as virus mutations could make them futile.\n Indeed, new Influenza virus strains emerge every year, requiring new immunizations.\n A tentative suggestion based on existing therapeutics, which would likely be resistant to new coronavirus mutations, is to use available angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1R) blockers, such as losartan, as therapeutics for reducing the aggressiveness and mortality from SARS?CoV?2 virus infections.\n This idea is based on observations that the angiotensin?converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) very likely serves as the binding site for SARS?CoV?2, the strain implicated in the current COVID?19 epidemic, similarly to strain SARS?CoV implicated in the 2002–2003 SARS epidemic.\n This commentary elaborates on the idea of considering AT1R blockers as tentative treatment for SARS?CoV?2 infections, and proposes a research direction based on datamining of clinical patient records for assessing its feasibility.\n","id":"PMC7228359","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley &amp; Sons,

possible mechanisms.\n ACE2 is a crucial component of the renin?angiotensin system (RAS).\n The classical RAS ACE?Ang II?AT1R regulatory axis and the ACE2?Ang 1?7?MasR counter?regulatory axis play an essential role in maintaining homeostasis in humans.\n ACE2 is widely distributed in the heart, kidneys, lungs, and testes.\n ACE2 antagonizes the activation of the classical RAS system and protects against organ damage, protecting against hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.\n Similar to SARS?CoV, SARS?CoV?2 also uses the ACE2 receptor to invade human alveolar epithelial cells.\n Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a clinical high?mortality disease, and ACE2 has a protective effect on this type of acute lung injury.\n Current research shows that the poor prognosis of patients with COVID?19 is related to factors such as sex (male), age (&gt;60 years), underlying diseases (hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease), secondary ARDS, and other relevant factors.\n Because of these protective effects of ACE2 on chronic underlying diseases and ARDS, the development of spike protein?based vaccine and drugs enhancing ACE2 activity may become one of the most promising approaches for the treatment of COVID?19 in the future.\n","id":"PMC7317908","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley and Sons

Pulmonary Disease Based on the Service-Oriented Architecture Paradigm and Business Process Management Strategy: Development and Usability Survey Among Patients and Health Care Providers","abstract":"Background\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic respiratory disease with a high global prevalence.\n\n The main scientific societies dedicated to the management of this disease have published clinical practice guidelines for quality practice.\n\n However, at present, there are important weaknesses in COPD diagnosis criteria that often lead to underdiagnosis or misdiagnosis.\n\n\nObjective\nWe sought to develop a new support system for COPD diagnosis.\n\n The system was designed to overcome the weaknesses detected in current guidelines with the goals of enabling early diagnosis, and improving the diagnostic accuracy and quality of care provided.\n\n\nMethods\nWe first analyzed the main clinical guidelines for COPD to detect weaknesses that exist in the current diagnostic process, and then proposed a redesign based on a business process management (BPM) strategy for its optimization.\n\n The BPM system acts as a backbone throughout the process of COPD diagnosis in this proposed approach.\n\n The newly developed support system was integrated into a health information system for validation of its use in a hospital environment.\n\n The system was qualitatively evaluated by experts (n=12) and patients (n=36).\n\n\nResults\nAmong the 12 experts, 10 (83%) positively evaluated our system with respect to increasing the speed for making the diagnosis, helping in interpreting results, and encouraging opportunistic diagnosis.\n\n With an overall rating of 4.29 on a 5-point scale, 27/36 (75%) of patients considered that the system was very useful in providing a warning about possible cases of COPD.\n\n The overall assessment of the system was 4.53 on a 5-point Likert scale with agreement to extend its use to all primary care centers.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe proposed system provides a functional method to overcome the weaknesses detected in the current diagnostic process for COPD, which can help foster early diagnosis, while improving the diagnostic accuracy and quality of care provided.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7109614","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"JMIR

disease (COPD) could become epidemic.\n\n An up-to-date nationwide estimation of COPD prevalence in China is needed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did a cross-sectional survey of a nationally representative sample of individuals from mainland China aged 40 years or older.\n\n The primary outcome was COPD, defined according to the 2017 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) lung function criteria.\n\n\nFindings\nBetween Dec 29, 2014, and Dec 31, 2015, 66?752 adults were recruited to the study population.\n\n The estimated standardised prevalence of COPD was 13·6% (95% CI 12·0–15·2).\n\n The prevalence of COPD differed significantly between men and women (19·0%, 95% CI 16·9–21·2 vs 8·1%, 6·8–9·3; p&lt;0·0001), mainly because of a significant difference in smoking status between men and women (current smokers 58·2% vs 4·0%).\n\n The prevalence of COPD differed by geographic region, with the highest prevalence in southwest China (20·2%, 95% CI 14·7–25·8) and the lowest in central China (10·2%, 8·2–12·2).\n\n Among adults with COPD, 56·4% (95% CI 53·7–59·2) had mild disease (GOLD stage I), 36·3% (34·3–38·3) had moderate disease (GOLD stage II), 6·5% (5·5–7·4) had severe disease (GOLD stage III), and 0·9% (0·6–1·1) had very severe disease (GOLD stage IV).\n\n\nInterpretation\nIn a large, nationally representative sample of adults aged 40 years or older, the estimated overall prevalence of COPD in China in 2014–15 was 13·6%, indicating that this disease has become a major public-health problem.\n\n Strategies aimed at prevention and treatment of COPD are

with poor outcomes.\n\n It can be symptomatically indistinguishable from exacerbations, making diagnosis challenging.\n\n Studies of pneumonia in COPD have focused on hospitalised patients and are not

outpatient COPD cohort.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>One hundred twenty-seven patients with moderate to very severe COPD aged 42–85 years underwent blood and sputum sampling over one year, at monthly stable visits and within 72 h of exacerbation symptom onset.\n\n 343 exacerbations with chest radiographs were included.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>20.1% of exacerbations had pneumonic infiltrates.\n\n

patients living with chronic non-communicable diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n\n However, the efficacy of tele-health in COPD is still controversial.\n\n Despite this, there appears to be widespread adoption of this technology.\n\n\nAim\nTo explore the international use of tele-heath for COPD, to assess the perceptions of clinicians employing tele-health in COPD, and to summarize the techniques that have been used by health care providers to personalize alarm limits for patients with COPD enrolled on tele-health programs.\n\n\nMethods\nA cross-sectional survey consisting of 15 questions was distributed and advertised to health care professionals worldwide.\n\n Questions were designed to cover five different aspects of tele-health in COPD: purpose of use, equipment type, clinician perceptions, variables monitored, and personalization of alarm limits.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 138 participants completed the survey from 29 different countries.\n\n As high as 59% of the participants had ever used tele-health for COPD, and 33% still provided tele-health services to patients with COPD.\n\n Tele-health was most commonly used for baseline monitoring, with 90% believing it to be effective.\n\n The three most commonly monitored variables were oxygen saturation, heart rate, and the use of rescue medication.\n\n\nConclusion\nTwenty-nine different countries use tele-health for managing COPD and therefore there is widespread international use of tele-health in COPD.\n\n The majority of providers thought tele-health was effective despite evidence to the contrary.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6682175","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Dove","authors":[{"firstname":"Ahmed M","surname":"Alrajeh","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yousef

vital resource to contain the virus’s spread and ensure continuity of care of patients with a chronic condition, notably arterial hypertension and heart disease.\n\n This paper reports the experience based on a telehealth platform used at scale to manage chronic disease patients in the Italian community.\n\n\nMethods and findings\nPatients’ health status was remotely monitored through ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), resting or ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG), spirometry, sleep oximetry, and cardiorespiratory polysomnography performed in community pharmacies or general practitioners’ offices.\n\n Patients also monitored their blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), blood oxygen saturation (SpO2), body temperature, body weight, waist circumference, blood glucose, and lipids at home through a dedicated smartphone app.\n\n All data conveyed to the web-based telehealth platform were used to manage critical patients by doctors promptly.\n\n Data were analyzed and compared across three consecutive periods of 2 months each: i) before the national lockdown, ii) during the lockdown (from March 9 to May 17, 2020), and iii) after the end of the containment measures.\n\n Overall, 13,613 patients visited community pharmacies or doctors’ offices.\n\n The number of overall tests dropped during and rose after the lockdown.\n\n The overall proportion of abnormal tests was larger during the outbreak.\n\n A significant increase in the prevalence of abnormal ECGs due to myocardial ischemia, contrasted by a significantly improved BP control, was observed.\n\n The number of home users and readings exchanged increased during the pandemic.\n\n In 226 patients, a significant increase in the proportion of SpO2 readings and a significant reduction in the entries for all other parameters, except BP, was observed.\n\n The proportion of abnormal SpO2 and BP values was significantly lower during the lockdown.\n\n Following the lockdown, the proportion of abnormal body weight or waist circumference values increased.\n\n\nConclusions\nOur study results support the usefulness of a telehealth solution to detect deterioration of the health

addresses 2 key policy questions, namely, the identification and selection of subgroups, while distinguishing 2 sources of potential value associated with heterogeneity.\n These are 1) the value of revealing the factors associated with heterogeneity in costs and outcomes using existing evidence (static value) and 2) the value of acquiring further subgroup-related evidence to resolve the uncertainty given the current understanding of heterogeneity (dynamic value).\n Consideration of these 2 sources of value can guide subgroup-specific treatment decisions and inform whether further research should be conducted to resolve uncertainty to explain variability in costs and outcomes.\n We apply the proposed methods to a cost-effectiveness analysis for the management of patients with acute coronary syndrome.\n This study presents the expected net benefits under current and perfect information when subgroups are defined based on the use and combination of 6 binary covariates.\n The results of the case study confirm the theoretical expectations.\n As more subgroups are considered, the marginal net benefit gains obtained under the current information show diminishing marginal returns, and the expected value of perfect information shows a decreasing trend.\n We present a suggested algorithm that synthesizes the results to guide

following hospital admission, are lacking.\n Patients admitted to twelve wards over a six-month period in 2005 were assessed for ADRs throughout their admission.\n Suspected ADRs were recorded and analysed for causality, severity and avoidability and whether they increased the length of stay.\n Multivariable analysis was undertaken to identify the risk factors for ADRs.\n The 5% significance level was used when assessing factors for inclusion in multivariable models.\n Out of the 3695 patient episodes assessed for ADRs, 545 (14.7%, 95% CI 13.6–15.9%) experienced one or more ADRs.\n Half of ADRs were definitely or possibly avoidable.\n The patients experiencing ADRs were more likely to be older, female, taking a larger number of medicines, and had a longer length of stay than those without ADRs.\n However, the only significant predictor of ADRs, from the multivariable analysis of a representative sample of patients, was the number of medicines taken by the patient with each additional medication multiplying the hazard of an ADR episode by 1.14 (95% CI 1.09, 1.20).\n ADRs directly increased length of stay in 147 (26.8%) patients.\n The drugs most frequently associated

precluded a systematic meta-analysis.\n\n Most studies reported process measures and not patient-level safety outcomes: We found no or limited evidence in 13 of 14 predefined safety areas, with good evidence limited to medication safety.\n\n\nConclusions\nPublished evidence for EHR impact on safety outcomes from interventional studies is limited and does not permit firm conclusions regarding the full safety impact of EHRs or support recommendations about ideal design features.\n\n The review highlights the need for greater transparency in quality assurance of existing EHRs and further research into suitable metrics and study designs.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7812113","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BMJ Publishing Group","authors":[{"firstname":"Christian

review of economic analyses in patient safety: a protocol designed to measure development in the scope and quality of evidence","abstract":"Introduction\nRecent avoidable failures in patient care highlight the ongoing need for evidence to support improvements in patient safety.\n\n According to the most recent reviews, there is a dearth of economic evidence related to patient safety.\n\n These reviews characterise an evidence gap in terms of the scope and quality of evidence available to support resource allocation decisions.\n\n This protocol is designed to update and improve on the reviews previously conducted to determine the extent of methodological progress in economic analyses in patient safety.\n\n\nMethods and analysis\nA broad search strategy with two core themes for original research (excluding opinion pieces and systematic reviews) in ‘patient safety’ and ‘economic analyses’ has been developed.\n\n Medline, Econlit and National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database bibliographic databases will be searched from January 2007 using a combination of medical subject headings terms and research-derived search terms (see table 1).\n\n The method is informed by previous reviews on this topic, published in 2012. Screening, risk of bias assessment (using the Cochrane collaboration tool) and economic evaluation quality assessment (using the Drummond checklist) will be conducted by two independent reviewers, with arbitration by a third reviewer as needed.\n\n Studies with a low risk of bias will be assessed using the Drummond checklist.\n\n High-quality economic evaluations are those that score &gt;20/35. A qualitative synthesis of evidence will be performed using a data collection tool to capture the study design(s) employed, population(s), setting(s), disease area(s), intervention(s) and outcome(s) studied.\n\n Methodological quality scores will be compared with previous reviews where possible.\n\n Effect size(s) and estimate uncertainty will be captured and used in a quantitative synthesis of high-quality evidence, where possible.\n\n\nEthics and dissemination\nFormal ethical approval is not required as primary data will not be collected.\n\n The results will be disseminated through a peer-reviewed publication, presentations and social media.\n\n\nTrial registration number\nCRD42017057853.\n","id":"PMC5724169","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BMJ Publishing Group","authors":[{"firstname":"Alexander W","surname":"Carter","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rishi","surname":"Mandavia","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Erik","surname":"Mayer","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Joachim","surname":"Marti","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Elias","surname":"Mossialos","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ara","surname":"Darzi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1111/j.1365-2834.2009.00992.x","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Improving patient safety: an economic perspective on the role of nurses","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMp1011024","date":"1970-01-01","title":"What is value in health care?","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1007/978-1-349-22512-5","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Market failure in health care","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/s1553-7250(05)31090-7","date":"1970-01-01","title":"What do we know about financial returns on investments in patient safety?

The study involved 337 standard screening hours and 315 telescreening hours.\n\n The primary outcome measure was patients screened per hour.\n\n Additional outcomes were rates of patients who left without being seen, rates of analgesia ordered by the screener, and proportion of patients with chest pain receiving or prescribed a standard set of tests and medications.\n\n\nResults\nIn-person screeners evaluated 1933 patients over 337 hours (5.7 patients per hour), whereas telescreeners evaluated 1497 patients over 315 hours (4.9 patients per hour; difference=0.8; 95% CI 0.5-1.2).\n\n Split analysis revealed that for the final 3 weeks of the evaluation, the patient-per-hour rate differential was neither clinically relevant nor statistically discernable (difference=0.2; 95% CI –0.7 to 1.2).\n\n There were fewer patients who left without being seen during in-person screening than during telescreening (2.6% vs 3.8%; difference=–1.2; 95% CI –2.4 to 0.0).\n\n However, compared to prior year-, date-, and time-matched data on weekdays from 1 am to 3 am, a period previously void of provider screening, telescreening decreased the rate of patients LWBS from 25.1% to 4.5% (difference=20.7%; 95% CI 10.1-31.2).\n\n Analgesia was ordered more frequently by telescreeners than by in-person screeners (51.2% vs 31.6%; difference=19.6%; 95% CI 12.1-27.1).\n\n There was no difference in standard care received by patients with chest pain between telescreening and in-person screening (29.4% vs 22.4%; difference=7.0%; 95% CI –3.4 to 17.4).\n\n\nConclusions\nAlthough the efficiency of telescreening, as measured by the rate of patients seen per hour, was lower early in the study period, telescreening achieved the same level of efficiency as in-person screening by the end of the pilot study.\n\n Adding telescreening during 1-3 am on weekdays dramatically decreased the number of patients who left without being seen compared to historic data.\n\n Telescreening was an effective and safe way for this ED to expand the hours in which patients were screened by a health care provider in triage.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6530260","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"JMIR

a Better Understanding of the Intention to Use mHealth Apps: Exploratory Study","abstract":"Background\nAn increasing number of mobile health (mHealth) apps are becoming available for download and use on mobile devices.\n\n Even with the increase in availability and use of mHealth apps, there has still not been a lot of research into understanding the intention to use this kind of apps.\n\n\nObjective\nThe purpose of this study was to investigate a technology acceptance model (TAM) that has been specially designed for primary health care applications.\n\n\nMethods\nThe proposed model is an extension of the TAM, and was empirically tested using data obtained from a survey of mHealth app users (n=310).\n\n The research analyzed 2 additional external factors: promotion of health and health benefits.\n\n Data were analyzed with a PLS–SEM software and confirmed that gender moderates the adoption of mHealth apps in Spain.\n\n The explanatory capacity (R2 for behavioral intention to use) of the proposed model was 76.4%.\n\n Likewise, the relationships of the external constructs of the extended TAM were found to be significant.\n\n\nResults\nThe results show the importance of healthy habits developed by using mHealth apps.\n\n In addition, communication campaigns for these apps should be aimed at transferring the usefulness of eHealth as an agent for transforming attitudes; additionally, as more health benefits are obtained, ease of use becomes greater.\n\n Perceived usefulness (PU; ?=.\n\n415, t0.001;4999=3.442, P=.\n\n001), attitude toward using (?=.\n\n301, t0.01;499=2.299, P=.\n\n02), and promotion of health (?=.\n\n210, t0.05;499=2.108, P=.\n\n03) were found to have a statistically significant impact on behavior intention to use eHealth apps (R2=76.4%).\n\n Perceived ease of use (PEOU; ?=.\n\n179, t0.01;499=2.623, P=.\n\n009) and PU (?=.\n\n755, t0.001;499=12.888, P&lt;.\n\n001) were found to have a statistically significant impact on attitude toward using (R2&gt;=78.2%).\n\n Furthermore, PEOU (?=.\n\n203, t0.01;499=2.810, P=.\n\n005), health benefits (?=.\n\n448, t0.001;499=4.010, P&lt;.\n\n001), and promotion of health (?=.\n\n281, t0.01;499=2.393, P=.\n\n01) exerted a significant impact on PU (R2=72.7%).\n\n Finally, health benefits (?=.\n\n640, t0.001;499=14.948, P&lt;.\n\n001) had a statistically significant impact on PEOU (R2=40.9%), while promotion of health (?=.\n\n865, t0.001;499=29.943, P&lt;.\n\n001) significantly influenced health benefits (R2=74.7%).\n\n\nConclusions\nmHealth apps could be used to predict the behavior of patients in the face of recommendations to prevent pandemics, such as COVID-19 or SARS, and to track users’ symptoms while they stay at home.\n\n Gender is a determining factor that influences the intention to use mHealth apps, so perhaps different interfaces and utilities could be designed according to gender.\n\n\n","id":"PMC8461538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"JMIR

The outbreak of COVID-19 is currently continuously evolving globally, resulting in 221,334 confirmed cases including in health-care workers, worldwide by March 20, 2020. Common symptoms of COVID-19 are a dry cough, a high temperature, fatigue and shortness of breath. In many severe cases, the coronavirus infection caused interstitial pneumonia which may lead to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and even death. Thus, the COVID-19 becomes an ongoing public health emergency of international significance.\nRecently, a meta-analysis of eligible studies in China revealed the proportion of hypertension in patients with COVID-19 were 17.1%, and the incidences of hypertension was about two folds higher in ICU/severe cases than in their non-ICU/severe counterparts. It suggests patients with hypertension may face an increased risk of developing into the severe condition after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The essential hypertension patients are basically treated with blood pressure lowering drugs, mainly including renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), diuretics. RAS blockers such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are primarily used to treat hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases to prevent heart/kidney failure or reduce the risk of stroke. Since angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was identified as the receptor of SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS- CoV, treatment of RAS blockers (ACEIs/ARBs) has attracted more attention. ACE2 is abundantly expressed in airway epithelial cells and induces viral pneumonia during COVID-19. ACE2 is also universally expressed in heart, liver, kidney, blood vessels and other tissues. Several studies evidenced that ACEIs/ARBs increase ACE2 expression and activity in the heart and kidneys in normotensive or hypertensive rats, suggesting that ACEIs/ARBs may be a risk factor for fatal Covid-19. However, ACEIs/ARBs prevent the progression of pulmonary complications in vulnerable populations, and reduce severe lung injury in certain viral pneumonias. Therefore, there is conflicting evidence about that use of ACEIs/ARBs has a positive or negative impact on COVID-19. Under these condition, HFSA/ACC/AHA and ESC just issued statement respectively, they emphasized there is no clinical or scientific evidence supporting harmful effect of ACEIs/ARBs in the context of the pandemic COVID-19 outbreak, recommending continuation of usual ACEIs/ARBs treatment for those hypertension or other cardiovascular diseases patients with COVID-19. They also point out these recommendations will be adjusted as needed to correspond with the latest research. Therefore, clinical analysis of RAS blockers treatment in patients with COVID is urgently needed.\nIn the present study, we investigate the clinical and laboratory characteristic of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with hypertension, and compare the difference between ACEIs/ARBs group and other blood pressure lowering drugs group. The study will provide clinical evidence on the impact of ACEIs/ARBs on the clinical course of COVID-19 infection.\nMethods\nPatients enrollment and data collection\nWe performed observational registry study in essential hypertension patients with COVID-19 admitted to the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (Wuhan, China) from Feb 7 to Mar 03, 2020. Baseline clinical data were collected at admission, and outcome data were collected prospectively by physicians who un-knew the study group. The primary endpoint was the time from illness onset to negative nucleic acid and the secondary endpoints were worsened Chest CT during hospitalization and in-hospital mortality.\nHypertension history and blood pressure medications were self-reported by all the patients. Confirmed COVID-19 cases were defined as those with epidemiological history, consistent with two clinical manifestations, and microbiological evidence [laboratory test for the COVID-19 from the respiratory specimens show positive result by the real-time reverse-transcription-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay] according to the Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Guideline (5th ed.) (in Chinese) published by the National Health Commission of China. Two patients secondary to chronic renal insufficiency were excluded from this study. We collected demographic and clinical data, laboratory parameters, chest CT imaging, management methods, and prognosis through electronic nursing and medical records using standardized data collection form. This study was approved by the institutional ethics board of the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (No. WDRY2020-K048). Written informed consent was waived owing to the urgent need to collect data.\nComplete blood count, coagulation profile, renal and liver function, creatine kinase, electrolytes, myocardial enzymes, CD4 and CD8 cell counts, C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer and procalcitonin were collected routinely on admission. Real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay was used to analyze the SARS-CoV-2 viral nucleic acid from pharyngeal swab specimens of Patients on admission and every 3 days during hospitalization. Detailed protocol was described in previous study. Chest radiographs or CT scan were also done for all inpatients on admission and every 5-7 days during hospitalization.\nClinically, illness severity of the COVID-19 patients was classified into mild, moderate, severe, and critically ill according to the Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Guideline (5th ed.) by the National Health Commission of China. Radiologically, the area of affected lungs consistent with viral pneumonia in each patient's first chest CT after admission was measured and classified into &lt;30%, 30-50%, and &gt;=50% of total lung area. During hospitalization, lesion progression in chest CT (worsened chest CT) was judged by 2 independent radiologists.\nDischarge criteria includes: (I) body temperature returns to normal for more than 3 days; (II) respiratory symptoms improved significantly; (III) lung imaging was significantly improved; (IV) nucleic acid of sputum sample was negative for two consecutive times.\nAll medical records were collected by cardiologists (Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University) who has been working in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (Wuhan, China) since January 2020 under the coordination of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. These records were copied and sent to the data-processing center of Shanghai Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Zhongshan Hospital in Shanghai. Experienced physicians and researchers reviewed and analyzed the data.\nStatistical analysis\nThis observational registry study aimed to answer the urgent hypothesis that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers may increase the severity of the currently pandemic of COVID-19, we shift of emphasis from a fixation on sample size to a focus on methodological quality would yield more studies with less bias. All data were collected and monitored centrally and summarized with descriptive statistics. Patients who received at least one type of RAS blockers were assigned into Group A (medication including RAS blockers). The rest of patients were assigned into Group B (medication without RAS blockers). Continuous data accorded with normal distribution were expressed as mean +- SD and compared by independent samples t-test, or expressed as median (25th-75th percentile) and compared by Wilcoxon rank sum test. Categorical variables were expressed as number (percentage) and compared by Chi-square test or Fisher exact test, as appropriate. And ordinal categorical variables were compared by Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test. Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS (v.22.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nResults\nStudy population\nThe study population consisted of 50 adult hypertension patients with COVID-19 infections. All these patients including 27 males (54%) and 23 females (46%) were treated with one or multiple blood pressure lowering drugs, including RAS blockers-ACEIs/ARBs (A), beta-Blockers (B), calcium channel blockers (C) and diuretics (D). The combinations of these drugs in the cohort are provided in Table 1. Briefly, 10 (50%) and 17 (56.7%) of the Group A and Group B participants were males (P=0.643), and the average age was 52.65+-13.12 and 67.77+-12.84 years (P=0.000), respectively (Table 2). The underlying diseases including diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and anemia in Group A and Group B are listed in Table 2. There was no significant difference between two groups.\nThe hypertension patients with COVID-19 were divided into Group A (including RAS blockers treatment) and Group B (non-RAS blockers treatment) according to the treatment of combination of blood lowering drugs\nDrug combination	n	 	Group A (n=20)		 	   A	8	 	   AB	3	 	   AC	6	 	   AD	2	 	   ABC	1	 	Group B (n=30)		 	   C	23	 	   BC	6	 	   BD	1	 	\nCOVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019; A, RAS blockers; ACEIs/ARBs; B, beta-blockers; c, calcium channel blockers; D, diuretics.\nComparison of demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 between Group A (including RAS blockers treatment) and Group B (non-RAS blockers treatment)\nCharacteristic	Group A (n=20)	Group B (n=30)	P value	 	Age (yrs, mean +- SD)	52.65+-13.12	67.77+-12.84	0.000	 	Age &gt;=65, n [%]	4 [20]	19 [63.33]	0.003	 	Male gender, n [%]	10 [50]	17 [56.67]	0.643	 	Underlying disease, n [%]			0.140	 	   Diabetes mellitus	0 [0]	4 [13.33]		 	   CAD	0 [0]	1 [3.33]		 	   COPD	1 [5]	0 [0]		 	   Anemia	1 [5]	0 [0]		 	Time since disease onset (days)	13.25+-2.17	15.17+-4.05	0.059	 	Highest temperature ( C)	38.54+-0.84	38.13+-1.01	0.140	 	Symptoms, n [%]				 	   Fever	19 [95]	28 [93.33]	1.000	 	   Cough	13 [65]	20 [66.67]	0.903	 	   Expectoration	2 [10]	8 [26.67]	0.149	 	   Dyspnea	3 [15]	9 [30]	0.371	 	   Diarrhoea	3 [15]	3 [10]	0.672	 	   Muscle ache	2 [10]	4 [13.33]	1.000	 	   Fatigue	9 [45]	9 [30]	0.279	 	   Anorexia	4 [20]	5 [16.67]	1.000	 	Vital signs				 	   Heart rate (bpm)	88.65+-18.25	85.1+-14.22	0.444	 	   Respiratory rate (breaths per minute)	20.2+-3.89	20.87+-4.48	0.590	 	   Systolic BP (mmHg)	124.9+-17.24	128.5+-19.55	0.507	 	   Diastolic BP (mmHg)	77.25+-12.48	77.83+-12.3	0.871	 	Clinical severity, n [%]			0.227	 	   Mild-moderate	7 [35]	6 [20]		 	   Severe	12 [60]	18 [60]		 	   Critically ill	1 [5]	6 [20]		 	In hospital mortality, n [%]	0 [0]	2 [6.67]	0.515	 	\nData are expressed as mean +- SD or number [%].

The data suggest that these blood pressure lowering drugs in Group A and Group B were similarly effective. Time from onset to hospitalization was 13.25+-2.17 days in Group A and 15.17+-4.05 days in Group B respectively (P=0.059). There was no difference in the highest temperature and the incidence of clinical symptoms including fever, cough, expectoration, shortness of breath et al. between the two groups (Table 2).\nThe clinical severity was graded as mild-moderate, severe and critically ill. There is no difference in any of grade between Group A and Group B.\nComparison of laboratory and radiologic findings\nThere was no significant difference in the blood cell test including lymphocyte count and neutrophil count between Group A and Group B (Table 3). Other laboratory findings including C-reactive protein and D-dimer level in Group A showed the similar results compare to those in Group B (Table 3).

Currently, the concern about the safety of ACEIs/ARBs treatment arises from the observation that COVID-19 virus binds to a specific enzyme called ACE2 to infect cells, and ACE2 expression or activity is increased following treatment with ACEIs and ARBs. Until now, there is no available clinical data about a differential use of RAS blockers (ACEIs/ARBs) in COVID-19 patients with hypertension.\nIn the present study, the blood pressure of both groups was under effective control. The age of non-RAS blockers was older than RAS group. CCBs rather than RAS blockers is recommended in elderly Chinese hypertensive population to reduce the risk of stroke, which is the major cardiovascular risk threatening the Chinese hypertensive population. This can explain the age gap in our study. We observed clinical symptoms including fever, cough, shortness of breath, the vital signs including demographic and clinical characteristics including blood pressure and heart rate, clinical severity on admission. There were no significant difference between RAS blockers group and non-RAS blockers group. We also observed laboratory findings including blood cell counts, blood biochemical indexes, and immunological index (CRP, CD8, CD4). These findings in RAS blockers group showed similar results to those in non-RAS blockers group.\nThe elevated serum NT-proBNP is related to heart failure and other cardiac problems, and it positively correlates to age of patients. We observed NT-proBNP was decreased in RAS blockers group in compared with non-RAS blockers group. But the elevated NT-proBNP (refers to NT-proBNP &gt;=125 pg/mL for those under 75 years old and &gt;=450 pg/mL for those over 75 years old) didn't show any difference between the two groups exclude the factor of age. Serum cTnI, an index for cardiac injury, showed significant lower level in RAS blockers group than that in non-RAS blockers. But there is no difference in cTnI level between the two groups after excluding the age factor. The patients with cTnI more than 0.04 ng/mL or elevated NT-proBNP level had no statistical significance between the two groups. Kennon et al. reported pretreatment with ACEIs reduced troponin release in patients with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes. However, ACEIs/ARBs are independently associated with postoperative troponin elevation and increased hospital stay in patients with spinal surgery. We speculate the effects of ACEIs/ARBs on cardiac troponin are dependent on pathophysiological conditions. According to the clinical data, some patients with COVID-19 developed acute cardiac injury evidenced by the elevated NT-proBNP or cardiac troponin. But until now there is no evidence that SARS-2 directly infects cardiomyocytes by ACE2. COVID-19 may affect the cardiovascular system through other mechanisms. COVID-19 mediated- hypoxaemia may be also an important reason of cardiac injury. Animal experiments revealed that ACEIs or ARBs protect heart from injury by multiple mechanisms under pressure overload or ischemia. In addition to the upregulation of ACE2 level, these drugs promote the proliferation of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), increased periostin expression or blocking TGF-beta signaling in heart tissue after myocardial infarction or pressure overload. Whether ACEIs/ARBs reduces cardiac troponin release or protect cardiac injury in hypertension patients with COVID-19 merits a large population of study.\nDuring hospitalization, these patients received similar therapies including antiviral therapy, anti-inflammatory therapy and oxygen therapy, Course of disease in RAS blockers group was similar to non-RAS blockers group. There is no difference in severe conditions evidenced by patients with worsened CT and in-hospital mortality between the RAS blockers group and non-RAS group. These data provide clinical analysis that RAS blockers doesn't aggravate the conditions of COVID-19 patients.\nOur study has some notable limitations. First, the limited number of cases were studied, the study power was not enough for multivariate regression analysis, a large population study will be required; second, data generation was clinically driven and not systematic. Other cardiac injury indexes need to be examined. Third, we didn't observe mild cases who were treated at home.\nIn conclusion, there is no obvious difference between the RAS blockers and non-RAS blockers in clinical features and course of hypertension patients suffering from the COVID-19.\nSupplementary\nProvenance and Peer Review: This article was submitted to ATM as a revised version along with the incisive peer review comments after rejection from another esteemed journal.

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7121484","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.\n\n Increasing quartile of NLR was statistically significantly associated with secondary outcome.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR is associated with outcomes in unselected critically ill patients.\n\n In patients with sepsis, there was no statistically significant relationship between NLR and mortality.\n\n Further investigation is required to increase understanding of the

Importantly, strains with high genetic similarity to SARS-CoV in the hypervariable N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 gene, the ORF3 and ORF8 region, respectively, were all discovered in this cave.\n In addition, we report the first discovery of bat SARSr-CoVs highly similar to human SARS-CoV in ORF3b and in the split ORF8a and 8b.\n Moreover, SARSr-CoV strains from this cave were more closely related to SARS-CoV in the non-structural protein genes ORF1a and 1b compared with those detected elsewhere.\n Recombination analysis shows evidence of frequent recombination events within the S gene and around the ORF8 between these SARSr-CoVs.\n We hypothesize that the direct progenitor of SARS-CoV may have originated after sequential recombination events between the precursors of these SARSr-CoVs.\n Cell entry studies demonstrated that three newly identified SARSr-CoVs with different S protein sequences are all able to use human ACE2 as the receptor, further exhibiting the close relationship between strains in this cave and SARS-CoV.\n This work provides new insights into the origin and evolution of SARS-CoV and highlights the necessity of preparedness for future emergence of SARS-like diseases.\n","id":"PMC5708621","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Ben","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei-Ping","surname":"Zeng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xing-Lou","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xing-Yi","surname":"Ge","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bei","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jia-Zheng","surname":"Xie","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xu-Rui","surname":"Shen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yun-Zhi","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ning","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dong-Sheng","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiao-Shuang","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mei-Niang","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Peter","surname":"Daszak","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin-Fa","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Lin-Fa","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jie","surname":"Cui","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng-Li","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng-Li","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christian","surname":"Drosten","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christian","surname":"Drosten","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christian","surname":"Drosten","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1128/JVI.06882-11","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Evidence for a common evolutionary origin of coronavirus spike protein receptor-binding subunits","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1126/science.1116480","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Structure of SARS coronavirus spike receptor-binding domain complexed with receptor","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00255","date":"1970-01-01","title":"ff14SB: improving the accuracy of protein side chain and backbone parameters from ff99SB","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1038/nature12005","date":"2013-02-13","title":"Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 is a functional receptor for the emerging human coronavirus-EMC","abstract":"Supplementary information\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1038/nature12005) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7095326","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing Group UK","authors":[{"firstname":"V.

Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitor and Angiotensin II Receptor Blocker Use in Hypertensive COVID-19 Patients Is Associated With Positive Clinical Outcome\nAbstract\nBackground\nThis study investigated continued and discontinued use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) during hospitalization of 614 hypertensive laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients.\nMethods\nDemographics, comorbidities, vital signs, laboratory data, and ACEi/ARB usage were analyzed. To account for confounders, patients were substratified by whether they developed hypotension and acute kidney injury (AKI) during the index hospitalization.\nResults\nMortality (22% vs 17%, P &gt; .05) and intensive care unit (ICU) admission (26% vs 12%, P &gt; .05) rates were not significantly different between non-ACEi/ARB and ACEi/ARB groups. However, patients who continued ACEi/ARBs in the hospital had a markedly lower ICU admission rate (12% vs 26%; P = .001; odds ratio [OR] = 0.347; 95% confidence interval [CI], .187-.643) and mortality rate (6% vs 28%; P = .001; OR = 0.215; 95% CI, .101-.455) compared to patients who discontinued ACEi/ARB. The odds ratio for mortality remained significantly lower after accounting for development of hypotension or AKI.\nConclusions\nThese findings suggest that continued ACEi/ARB use in hypertensive COVID-19 patients yields better clinical outcomes.\nIn hypertensive patients with COVID-19, in-hospital continuation of ACE inhibitors or ARBs is associated with lower rates of mortality and intensive care admission in the absence of hypotension or acute kidney injury.\nHypertension is a common comorbidity in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and has been associated with worse clinical outcomes. Because the widely used antihypertensive medications angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) may upregulate ACE2 receptors, through which severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) enters the host cells, concerns have been raised as to whether their use may result in increased morbidity and mortality. On the other hand, ACE2 has also been shown to have vasodilatory, anti-inflammatory, and antifibrotic effects that could potentially alleviate disease severity.\nSeveral clinical studies have reported that ACEi/ARB use in COVID-19 patients with hypertension does not worsen COVID-19 disease severity or mortality. However, these studies have either focused on ACEi/ARB use prior to hospitalization or did not control for potential clinical interactions for which ACEi/ARB use might be discontinued, such as the development of hypotension or acute kidney injury (AKI). Despite limited data, a number of professional societies have released statements recommending that ACEi/ARBs should be continued in hypertensive COVID-19 patients. This is based, in part, on the belief that these agents serve a beneficial role in treating underlying cardiovascular disease and may preclude further clinical deterioration.\nStony Brook University Hospital, about 40 miles east of New York City, is the largest academic hospital in Suffolk County, serving a population of approximately 1.5 million people and with over 39 000 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients at the time of this analysis. The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of in-hospital continuation and discontinuation of ACEi/ARBs on the clinical outcomes of hypertensive COVID-19 patients, controlling for newly developed hypotension or AKI during hospitalization.\nMETHODS\nStudy Population and Data Collection\nThis retrospective single-center study from Stony Brook University Hospital was approved by the Human Subjects Committee with an exemption for informed consent and a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) waiver. The Stony Brook University Hospital COVID-19 Persons Under Investigation Registry consisted of 6235 patients clinically suspected of COVID-19 infection from 7 February 2020 to 23 May 2020. Confirmation of COVID-19 infection was based on a positive real-time polymerase chain reaction test for SARS-CoV-2 on a nasopharyngeal swab specimen. Clinical data at hospital admission, including demographic information, chronic comorbidities present on admission, vital signs, laboratory blood tests, and outcomes, were extracted individually from the patients' electronic medical records. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality and the secondary outcome was intensive care unit (ICU) admission.\nPatients were divided into 2 groups; hypertensive patients: (1) that were not taking ACEi/ARBs at home (group A), and (2) taking ACEi/ARBs at home. The latter group was further divided into those who discontinued ACEi/ARBs during their hospital stay (group B), and those who continued ACEi/ARBs during their hospital stay (group C).\nStatistical Analysis\nFrequencies and percentages for categorical variables between the ACEi/ARB groups were compared using chi 2 tests. Continuous variables, expressed as median (interquartile range [IQR]), were compared between groups using nonparametric Mann-Whitney U tests. Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons was used where appropriate. Mortality and ICU admission rates were compared between group B (ACEi/ARB discontinued) and C (ACEi/ARB continued) with chi 2 tests (unadjusted without covariates) and with logistic regression (adjusted with covariates). Age, sex, and significantly different comorbidities between groups were included in logistic regression models as covariates for controlling confounding effects. Analyses were also stratified by hypotension and AKI status. P values &lt; .05 were considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 26 (IBM Corporation).\nRESULTS\nPatient Selection\nThe Stony Brook University Hospital COVID-19 Persons Under Investigation Registry consisted of 6235 patients clinically suspected of COVID-19 infection who presented to the emergency department between 7 February and 23 May 2020, of which 2789 were confirmed to be COVID-19 positive (Figure 1). There were 875 patients in this cohort who had a history of hypertension. We excluded 211 patients who were discharged directly from the emergency department, 5 who were transferred to other hospitals, and 45 whose discharge status was still unknown as of 23 May 2020. This yielded a final sample size of 614 hospitalized COVID-19 patients with a history of hypertension. Group A consisted of 279 hypertensive patients who did not take ACEi/ARBs prior to admission, of whom 224 did not require ICU care (ie, general admission) and 55 required ICU care at any point during hospitalization. There were 62 deaths in this group. Group B consisted of 171 hypertensive patients who discontinued their home medications, ACEi/ARBs, in the hospital, of whom 126 did not require ICU care and 45 required ICU care. There were 48 deaths in this group. Group C consisted of 164 hypertensive patients who continued their home medications, ACEi/ARBs, in the hospital, of whom 144 did not require ICU care and 20 required ICU care. There were 10 deaths in this group.\nFlowchart of patient selection. Abbreviations: ACEi, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor; ARB, angiotensin II receptor blocker; ED, emergency department; ICU, intensive care unit; PUI, persons under investigation.\nPatient Demographics, Comorbidities, and Laboratory Tests\nThe median age of patients in the non-ACEi/ARB group was older than that of the ACEi/ARB group (73 years [IQR, 62-83] versus 68 years [IQR, 58-79], P = .004; Table 1). Sex and ethnicity were not significantly different between groups (P &gt; .05). The prevalence of diabetes mellitus was higher in those in the ACEi/ARB group (P = .01) but lower in those with chronic kidney disease (CKD) at baseline (P = .001), whereas the prevalence of asthma, history of coronary heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cancer were not significantly different between groups (P &gt; .05). Note that the prevalence of CKD in our hypertensive COVID-19 patient cohort was higher than that for all COVID-19 patients in general as expected.\nCharacteristics of Patients Who Did Not Receive ACEi/ARB (Group A) and Who Did Receive ACEi/ARB (Groups B and C)\nDemographics	Non-ACEi/ARB (Group A, n = 279)	ACEi/ARB (Groups B + C, n = 335)	P Value	 	Age, y, median (IQR)	73 (62-83)	68 (58-79)	.004	 	Hospital stay duration, d, median (IQR)	6 (3-11)	7 (4-12)	NS	 	Sex				 	 Female 	 	 Male	130 (46.6) 	 	149 (53.4)	146 (43.6) 	 	189 (56.4)	NS	 	Ethnicity				 	 White 	 	 African American 	 	 Asian 	 	 Native American 	 	 Other	176 (63.1) 	 	25 (9.0) 	 	9 (3.2) 	 	3 (1.1) 	 	66 (23.6)	200 (59.7) 	 	27 (8.1) 	 	13 (3.9) 	 	0 (0) 	 	95 (28.4)	NS	 	Comorbidities				 	 Diabetes	98 (35.1)	152 (45.4)	.010	 	 Asthma	11 (3.9)	22 (6.6)	NS	 	 Coronary heart disease	66 (23.7)	82 (24.6)	NS	 	 COPD	45 (16.1)	37 (11.0)	.065	 	 Heart failure	44 (15.8)	38 (11.3)	NS	 	 Cancer	39 (14.0)	32 (9.6)	.088	 	 Chronic kidney disease	65 (23.4)	30 (9.0)	.001	 	\nValues are No. (%) except where indicated.

The major findings are: (1) hypertensive COVID-19 patients who continued ACEi/ARBs in the hospital had lower in-hospital mortality and ICU admission compared to those who discontinued ACEi/ARBs; (2) for in-hospital mortality, this conclusion remained true after controlling for confounders by excluding patients who developed hypotension or AKI for which ACEi/ARBs were withheld on clinical grounds; and (3) for ICU admission, this conclusion remained true after excluding patients who developed AKI. Overall, patients who were able to continue their ACEi/ARB had markedly lower mortality and ICU admission rates, suggesting that the ability to continue ACEi/ARB use is associated with improved clinical outcomes in hypertensive COVID-19-positive patients and ACEi/ARB may themselves be beneficial.\nAlthough there were initial concerns regarding the safety of ACEi/ARB use in hypertensive COVID-19 patients, the majority of recent clinical studies found neutral effects of ACEi/ARB on COVID-19 severity. In a propensity score-matched analysis of over 12 500 patients in a New York City health system, Reynolds et al reported that home-use of ACEi/ARBs conferred no significant increase in the likelihood of developing severe COVID-19. Yang et al conducted a retrospective case-control study in a single institution in Wuhan, China. Similar to Reynolds et al, they reported no significant difference in mortality and disease severity in patients taking ACEi/ARBs, although they noted that patients taking ACEi/ARBs had lower levels of inflammatory markers such as C-reactive peptide and procalcitonin. If these medications are indeed associated with lower inflammatory markers, they could conceivably play a role in mediating the dysregulated inflammatory response seen in severe COVID-19 infections. For the 2 aforementioned studies, it was unclear whether ACEi/ARB use was continued throughout the hospital course. Li et al accounted for inpatient use of ACEi/ARBs in COVID-19 patients, defining ACEi/ARB use as use of the medications at admission and continued throughout hospitalization. They did not compare the outcomes of patients who continued versus discontinued medication use in the hospital. They concluded that the percentages of patients with hypertension taking ACEi/ARBs did not differ between those with severe and nonsevere infections nor did it differ between nonsurvivors and survivors. Meng et al reported potentially positive outcomes in patients taking ACEi/ARBs. In a small cohort of 51 hypertensive COVID-19 patients from Wuhan, China, they found that patients on ACEi/ARBs included fewer severe cases. Zhang et al found similar positive associations. They used propensity score matching for age, sex, symptoms, comorbidities, creatinine, and other variables. They reported that inpatient ACEi/ARB use was associated with lower mortality rates compared to non-ACEi/ARB users. However, this study did not account for confounding clinical factors for which ACEi/ARBs may be discontinued, such as the development of AKI or hypotension during hospitalization.\nIn contrast to most previous studies discussed above, we found that in-hospital continuation of ACEi/ARB use was associated with better outcomes compared to in-hospital discontinuation of ACEi/ARB use. Hypertensive SARS-CoV-2 patients not on ACEi/ARBs, compared with those taking ACEi/ARBs, did not show increased risk of development of hypotension or AKI. ACEi/ARBs were discontinued because of the development of hypotension or AKI. Patients who developed hypotension or AKI had a higher mortality rate. It is important to control for these 2 confounders. In the absence of hypotension or AKI, patients who continued ACEi/ARBs had lower mortality and ICU admission rates compared to those who discontinued them, further supporting that continued ACEi/ARB use may have beneficial effects. To our knowledge, this study reports the largest cohort of hospitalized hypertensive COVID-19 patients on ACEi/ARBs from a large academic hospital in the United States.\nThe mechanisms by which ACEi and ARBs may exert their beneficial effects in hypertensive COVID-19 patients are unknown. The continuation of ACEi/ARBs during hospitalization may blunt the adverse effects of hypertension, a well-known risk factor for mortality in COVID-19. ACEi/ARBs have cardioprotective effects in postmyocardial infarction and heart failure patients by reducing myocardial wall stress. Additionally, ACEi/ARBs have been shown to reduce microvascular complications in patients with cardiac, cerebrovascular, and renal comorbidities. Experimentally, ACEis and ARBs have the ability to upregulate ACE2, which leads to the degradation of angiotensin II and the increased formation of angiotensin 1-7; the latter is thought to have beneficial vasodilatory, anti-inflammatory, and antifibrotic effects. It is also interesting to speculate that ACEi/ARBs may play a role in ameliorating the detrimental effects of the cytokine storm seen during the immune response to SARS-CoV-2, a state that has been linked to the proinflammatory effects of angiotensin II. Finally, ARBs have been shown to prevent aggravation of acute lung injury in mice infected with the closely related betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-1, suggesting a primary pulmonary protective role.\nFinally, it is worth noting that the reasons for stopping ACEi/ARBs were undoubtedly complex with multiple documented and undocumented possibilities. In clinical practice, hypotension and AKI are the most frequent justifications for stopping ACEi/ARBs and there did not appear to be any indication that the current pandemic altered that paradigm. However, this is a retrospective study and the decision to continue or discontinue ACEi/ARB use was part of standard clinical care.\nThis study has several limitations. It was a retrospective single-center study. Laboratory values were not reassessed in patients who continued or discontinued ACEi/ARBs. Moreover, the difference between ACEi and ARB use could not be resolved due to the limited sample size. Although ACEis and ARBs have similar mechanisms of action, their effects may need to be studied separately. This study did not account for when ACEi/ARBs were discontinued for individual patients during their hospital stay. The current sample size did not allow for substratification based on how long the patients were on these medications before they were discontinued. Individual chart review indicated that hypotension and AKI were the main documented reasons for ACEi/ARB discontinuation. However, in some instances, justification could not be discerned. Moreover, early on in the pandemic, uncertainty existed as to whether ACEi/ARBs were harmful so individual practitioners may have reflexively held these medications without indicating their justification. This contribution is beyond the analysis of the present investigation.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese findings not only confirm that ACEi/ARB use does not worsen clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients with a history of hypertension, but also suggest that COVID-19 patients who are on ACEi/ARBs should continue these medications in the hospital as they may have beneficial effects, as long as these patients do not develop hypotension or AKI.\nNotes\n Acknowledgments.

pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on

were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in

Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China5.\n This outbreak highlights the ongoing ability of viral spill-over from animals to cause severe disease in humans.\n","id":"PMC7094943","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing Group UK","authors":[{"firstname":"Fan","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Su","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yan-Mei","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wen","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhi-Gang","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Wu","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Wu","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jun-Hua","surname":"Tian","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan-Yuan","surname":"Pei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ming-Li","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yu-Ling","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fa-Hui","surname":"Dai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi-Min","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiao-Jiao","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Edward C.","surname":"Holmes","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong-Zhen","surname":"Zhang","email":"zhangyongzhen@shphc.org.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong-Zhen","surname":"Zhang","email":"zhangyongzhen@shphc.org.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.micinf.2020.01.003","date":"2020-01-24","title":"Measures for diagnosing and treating infections by a novel coronavirus responsible for a pneumonia outbreak originating in Wuhan, China","abstract":"On 10 January 2020, a new coronavirus causing a pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan City in central China was denoted as 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization (WHO).\n As of 24 January 2020, there were 887 confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV infection, including 26 deaths, reported in China and other countries.\n Therefore, combating this new virus and stopping the epidemic is a matter of urgency.\n Here, we focus on advances in research and development of fast diagnosis methods, as well as potential prophylactics and therapeutics to prevent or treat 2019-nCoV infection.\n","id":"PMC7102556","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Institut Pasteur.

P?&lt;?.\n01) was negatively correlated with the CT severity scores.\n The receiver?operating characteristic analysis demonstrated that area under the curve of CRP on the first visit for predicting severe COVID?19 was 0.87 (95% CI 0.10–1.00) at 20.42 mg/L cut?off, with sensitivity and specificity 83% and 91%, respectively.\n CRP in severe COVID?19 patients increased significantly at the initial stage, before CT findings.\n Importantly, CRP, which was associated with disease development, predicted early severe COVID?19.","id":"PMC7262341","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley and Sons Inc.","authors":[{"firstname":"Chaochao","surname":"Tan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fengxia","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kui","surname":"Tan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qionghui","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xixin","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaosong","surname":"Li","email":"lxsong0308@163.com","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.eclinm.2020.100375","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Eosinopenia and elevated C-reactive protein facilitate triage of COVID-19 patients in fever clinic: A retrospective case-control study","abstract":"Background\nCoronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently a pandemic affecting over 200 countries.\n\n Many cities have established designated fever clinics to triage suspected COVID-19 patients from other patients with similar symptoms.\n\n However, given the limited availability of the nucleic acid test as well as long waiting time for both the test and radiographic examination, the quarantine or therapeutic decisions for a large number of mixed patients were often not made in time.\n\n We aimed to identify simple and quickly available laboratory biomarkers to facilitate effective triage at the fever clinics for sorting suspected COVID-19 patients from those with COVID-19-like symptoms.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected clinical, etiological, and laboratory data of 989 patients who visited the Fever Clinic at Wuhan Union Hospital, Wuhan, China, from Jan 31 to Feb 21. Based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) nucleic acid testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection, they were divided into two groups: SARS-CoV-2-positive patients as cases and SARS-CoV-2-negative patients as controls.\n\n We compared the clinical features and laboratory findings of the two groups, and analyzed the diagnostic performance of several laboratory parameters in predicting SARS-CoV-2 infection and made relevant comparisons to the China diagnosis guideline of having a normal or decreased number of leukocytes (?9·5 109/L) or lymphopenia (&lt;1·1 109/L).\n\n\nFindings\nNormal or decreased number of leukocytes (?9·5 109/L), lymphopenia (&lt;1·1 109/L), eosinopenia (&lt;0·02 109/L), and elevated hs-CRP (?4 mg/L) were presented in 95·0%, 52·2%, 74·7% and 86·7% of COVID-19 patients, much higher than 87·2%, 28·8%, 31·3% and 45·2% of the controls, respectively.\n\n The eosinopenia produced a sensitivity of 74·7% and specificity of 68·7% for separating the two groups with the area under the curve (AUC) of 0·717.

the activation of the classical RAS system and protects against organ damage, protecting against hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.\n Similar to SARS?CoV, SARS?CoV?2 also uses the ACE2 receptor to invade human alveolar epithelial cells.\n Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a clinical high?mortality disease, and ACE2 has a protective effect on this type of acute lung injury.\n Current research shows that the poor prognosis of patients with COVID?19 is related to factors such as sex (male), age (&gt;60 years), underlying diseases (hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease), secondary ARDS, and other relevant factors.\n Because of these protective effects of ACE2 on chronic underlying diseases and ARDS, the development of spike protein?based vaccine and drugs enhancing ACE2 activity may become one of the most promising approaches for the treatment of COVID?19 in the future.\n","id":"PMC7317908","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley and Sons

implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and Prevention of Infectious Disease in China, Chinese Academy of Sciences,

2019-nCoV has 89% nucleotide identity with bat SARS-like-CoVZXC21 and 82% with that of human SARS-CoV.\n The phylogenetic trees of their orf1a/b, Spike, Envelope, Membrane and Nucleoprotein also

beta-sheet(s) containing six strands.\n Learning from the roles of civet in SARS and camel in MERS, hunting for the animal source of 2019-nCoV and its more ancestral virus would be important for

effector peptide of the system and exerts multiple biological functions, whereas ACE2 reduces angiotensin II levels.\n Importantly, our recent studies using ACE2 knockout mice have demonstrated that ACE2 protects murine lungs from ARDS.\n Furthermore, SARS?CoV infections and the Spike protein of the SARS?CoV reduce ACE2 expression.\n Notably, injection of SARS?CoV Spike into mice worsens acute lung failure in vivo, which can be attenuated by blocking the renin–angiotensin pathway, suggesting that the activation of the pulmonary RAS influences the pathogenesis of ALI/ARDS and SARS.\n\n","id":"PMC7197898","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Blackwell Publishing

implicated in the pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\n\n We postulated that repleting ACE2 using GSK2586881, a recombinant form of human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (rhACE2), could attenuate acute lung injury.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>We conducted a two-part phase II trial comprising an open-label intrapatient dose escalation and a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase in ten intensive care units in North America.\n\n Patients were between the ages of 18 and 80 years, had an American-European Consensus Criteria consensus diagnosis of ARDS, and had been mechanically ventilated for less than 72 h.\n\n In part A, open-label GSK2586881 was administered at doses from 0.1 mg/kg to 0.8 mg/kg to assess safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics.\n\n Following review of data from part A, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled investigation of twice-daily doses of GSK2586881 (0.4 mg/kg) for 3 days was conducted (part B).\n\n Biomarkers, physiological assessments, and clinical endpoints were collected over the dosing period and during follow-up.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>Dose escalation in part A was well-tolerated without clinically significant hemodynamic changes.\n\n Part B was terminated after 39 of the planned 60 patients following a planned futility analysis.\n\n Angiotensin II levels decreased rapidly following infusion of GSK2586881, whereas angiotensin-(1–7) and angiotensin-(1–5) levels increased and remained elevated for 48 h.\n\n Surfactant protein D concentrations were increased, whereas there

treat the novel coronavirus originating in Wuhan, China","abstract":"A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) originating in Wuhan, China presents a potential respiratory viral pandemic to the world population.\n Current efforts are focused on containment and quarantine of infected individuals.\n Ultimately, the outbreak could be controlled with a protective vaccine to prevent 2019-nCoV infection.\n While vaccine research should be pursued intensely, there exists today no therapy to treat 2019-nCoV upon infection, despite an urgent need to find options to help these patients and preclude potential death.\n Herein, I review the potential options to treat 2019-nCoV in patients, with an emphasis on the necessity for speed and timeliness in developing new and effective therapies in this outbreak.\n I consider the options of drug repurposing, developing neutralizing monoclonal antibody therapy, and an oligonucleotide strategy targeting the viral RNA genome, emphasizing the promise and pitfalls of these approaches.\n Finally, I advocate for the fastest strategy to develop a treatment now, which could be resistant to any mutations the virus may have in the future.\n The proposal is a biologic that blocks 2019-nCoV entry using a soluble version of the viral receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), fused to an immunoglobulin Fc domain (ACE2-Fc), providing a neutralizing antibody with maximal breath to avoid any viral escape, while also helping to recruit the immune system to build lasting immunity.\n The ACE2-Fc therapy would also supplement decreased ACE2 levels in the lungs during infection, thereby directly treating acute respiratory distress pathophysiology as a third mechanism of action.\n The sequence of the ACE2-Fc protein is provided to investigators, allowing its possible use in recombinant protein expression systems to start producing drug today to treat patients under compassionate use, while formal clinical trials are later undertaken.\n Such a treatment could help infected patients before a protective vaccine is developed and widely available in the coming months to year(s).\n","id":"PMC7029759","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"F1000 Research Limited","authors":[{"firstname":"Robert

Full-length genome sequences were obtained from five patients at an early stage of the outbreak.\n The sequences are almost identical and share 79.6% sequence identity to SARS-CoV.\n Furthermore, we show that 2019-nCoV is 96% identical at the whole-genome level to a bat coronavirus.\n Pairwise protein sequence analysis of seven conserved non-structural proteins domains show that this virus belongs to the species of SARSr-CoV.\n In addition, 2019-nCoV virus isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of a critically ill patient could be neutralized by sera from several patients.\n Notably, we confirmed that 2019-nCoV uses the same cell entry receptor—angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2)—as SARS-CoV.\n","id":"PMC7095418","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing Group UK","authors":[{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xing-Lou","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xian-Guang","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ben","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hao-Rui","surname":"Si","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yan","surname":"Zhu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bei","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chao-Lin","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui-Dong","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yun","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hua","surname":"Guo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ren-Di","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mei-Qin","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xu-Rui","surname":"Shen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xi","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiao-Shuang","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kai","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Quan-Jiao","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fei","surname":"Deng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin-Lin","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bing","surname":"Yan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fa-Xian","surname":"Zhan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yan-Yi","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Geng-Fu","surname":"Xiao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng-Li","surname":"Shi","email":"zlshi@wh.iov.cn","contributions":"0"}]}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Risks of ACE inhibitor and ARB usage in COVID-19: evaluating the evidence","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Are patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus at increased risk for COVID-19 infection?","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Rapid response: use of angiotensin receptor blockers such as Telmisartan, Losartsan in nCoV Wuhan Corona Virus infections:novel mode of treatment.

is to understand the virus’s receptor recognition mechanism, which regulates its infectivity, pathogenesis and host range.\n SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV recognize the same receptor - human ACE2 (hACE2) 3,4.\n Here we determined the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) (engineered to facilitate crystallization) in complex of hACE2. Compared with SARS-CoV RBD, a hACE2-binding ridge in SARS-CoV-2 RBD takes a more compact conformation; moreover, several residue changes in SARS-CoV-2 RBD stabilize two virus-binding hotspots at the RBD/hACE2 interface.\n These structural features of SARS-CoV-2 RBD enhance its hACE2-binding affinity.\n Additionally, we showed that RaTG13, a bat coronavirus closely related to SARS-CoV-2, also uses hACE2 as its receptor.\n The differences among SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and RaTG13 in hACE2 recognition shed light on potential animal-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

This includes patients with hypertension, heart disease, diabetes mellitus, and clearly the elderly.\n Many of those patients are treated with renin-angiotensin system blockers.\n Because the ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) protein is the receptor that facilitates coronavirus entry into cells, the notion has been popularized that treatment with renin-angiotensin system blockers might increase the risk of developing a severe and fatal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection.\n The present article discusses this concept.\n ACE2 in its full-length form is a membrane-bound enzyme, whereas its shorter (soluble) form circulates in blood at very low levels.\n As a mono-carboxypeptidase, ACE2 contributes to the degradation of several substrates including angiotensins I and II.\n ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors do not inhibit ACE2 because ACE and ACE2 are different enzymes.\n Although angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers have been shown to upregulate ACE2 in experimental animals, the evidence is not always consistent and differs among the diverse angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers and differing organs.\n Moreover, there are no data to support the notion that ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker administration facilitates coronavirus entry by increasing ACE2 expression in either animals or humans.\n Indeed, animal data support elevated ACE2 expression as conferring potential protective pulmonary and cardiovascular effects.\n In summary, based on the currently available evidence, treatment with renin-angiotensin system blockers should not be discontinued because of concerns with coronavirus infection.\n","id":"PMC7225046","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Lippincott, Williams &amp; Wilkins","authors":[{"firstname":"A.H.

severe cases resulted in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is a severe form of acute lung injury (ALI) that further contributes to morbidity.\n To date, no effective drugs that improve the clinical outcome of influenza A (H7N9) virus-infected patients have been identified.\n Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and ACE2 are involved in several pathologies such as cardiovascular functions, renal disease, and acute lung injury.\n In the current study, we report that ACE2 could mediate the severe acute lung injury induced by influenza A (H7N9) virus infection in an experimental mouse model.\n Moreover, ACE2 deficiency worsened the disease pathogenesis markedly, mainly by targeting the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1).\n The current findings demonstrate that ACE2 plays a critical role in influenza A (H7N9) virus-induced acute lung injury, and suggest that might be a useful potential therapeutic target for future influenza A (H7N9)

This includes patients with hypertension, heart disease, diabetes mellitus, and clearly the elderly.\n Many of those patients are treated with renin-angiotensin system blockers.\n Because the ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) protein is the receptor that facilitates coronavirus entry into cells, the notion has been popularized that treatment with renin-angiotensin system blockers might increase the risk of developing a severe and fatal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection.\n The present article discusses this concept.\n ACE2 in its full-length form is a membrane-bound enzyme, whereas its shorter (soluble) form circulates in blood at very low levels.\n As a mono-carboxypeptidase, ACE2 contributes to the degradation of several substrates including angiotensins I and II.\n ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors do not inhibit ACE2 because ACE and ACE2 are different enzymes.\n Although angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers have been shown to upregulate ACE2 in experimental animals, the evidence is not always consistent and differs among the diverse angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers and differing organs.\n Moreover, there are no data to support the notion that ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker administration facilitates coronavirus entry by increasing ACE2 expression in either animals or humans.\n Indeed, animal data support elevated ACE2 expression as conferring potential protective pulmonary and cardiovascular effects.\n In summary, based on the currently available evidence, treatment with renin-angiotensin system blockers should not be discontinued because of concerns with coronavirus infection.\n","id":"PMC7225046","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Lippincott, Williams &amp; Wilkins","authors":[{"firstname":"A.H.

dysregulated in cardiovascular disease, and this enzyme is used by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to initiate the infection.\n Cardiovascular disease and pharmacologic RAS inhibition both increase ACE2 levels, which may increase the virulence of SARS-CoV-2 within the lung and heart.\n Conversely, mechanistic evidence from related coronaviruses suggests that

epidemics combined.\n Therapeutics that may assist to contain its rapid spread and reduce its high mortality rates are urgently needed.\n Developing vaccines against the SARS?CoV?2 virus may take many months.\n Moreover, vaccines based on viral?encoded peptides may not be effective against future coronavirus epidemics, as virus mutations could make them futile.\n Indeed, new Influenza virus strains emerge every year, requiring new immunizations.\n A tentative suggestion based on existing therapeutics, which would likely be resistant to new coronavirus mutations, is to use available angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1R) blockers, such as losartan, as therapeutics for reducing the aggressiveness and mortality from SARS?CoV?2 virus infections.\n This idea is based on observations that the angiotensin?converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) very likely serves as the binding site for SARS?CoV?2, the strain implicated in the current COVID?19 epidemic, similarly to strain SARS?CoV implicated in the 2002–2003 SARS epidemic.\n This commentary elaborates on the idea of considering AT1R blockers as tentative treatment for SARS?CoV?2 infections, and proposes a research direction based on datamining

The association between patient predictor variables and SARS-CoV-2 status, ICU admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, and mortality was explored with univariate and multivariate analyses.\n\n\nResults\nBetween March 12 and April 14, 2020, we treated 4,404 persons under investigation for COVID-19 infection, of whom 68% were discharged home, 29% were admitted to a regular floor, and 3% to an ICU.\n\n One thousand six hundred fifty-one of 3,369 patients tested have had SARS-CoV-2–positive results to date.\n\n Of patients with regular floor admissions, 13% were subsequently upgraded to the ICU after a median of 62 hours (interquartile range 28 to 106 hours).\n\n Fifty patients required invasive mechanical ventilation in the ED, 4 required out-of-hospital invasive mechanical ventilation, and another 167 subsequently required invasive mechanical ventilation in a median of 60 hours (interquartile range 26 to 99) hours after admission.\n\n Testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 and lower oxygen saturations were associated with need for ICU and invasive mechanical ventilation, and with death.\n\n High respiratory rates were associated with the need for ICU care.\n\n\nConclusion\nPersons under investigation for COVID-19 infection contribute significantly to the health care burden beyond those ruling in for SARS-CoV-2. For every 100 admitted persons under investigation, 9 will require ICU stay, invasive mechanical ventilation, or both on arrival and another 12 within 2 to 3 days of hospital admission, especially persons under investigation with lower oxygen saturations and positive SARS-CoV-2 swab results.\n\n This information should help hospitals manage the pandemic efficiently.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7211647","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"by the American College of Emergency Physicians.","authors":[{"firstname":"Adam J.","surname":"Singer","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Eric J.","surname":"Morley","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kristen","surname":"Meyers","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rafael","surname":"Fernandes","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alison L.","surname":"Rowe","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Peter","surname":"Viccellio","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Henry C.","surname":"Thode","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alexander","surname":"Bracey","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mark C.","surname":"Henry","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Zu N, Zhang D, Wang W, et al.

the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing Municipal Science and Technology

(ACE-2) is a homolog of ACE that preferentially forms angiotensin-(ANG)-1-7 from angiotensin II (ANG II).\n We investigated the cardioprotective effects of telmisartan, a well-known angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) against experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM).\n EAM was induced in Lewis rats by immunization with porcine cardiac myosin.\n The rats were divided into two groups and treated with telmisartan (10 mg/kg/day) or vehicle for 21 days.\n Myocardial functional parameters were significantly improved by treatment with telmisartan compared with vehicle-treated rats.\n Telmisartan lowered myocardial protein expressions of NADPH oxidase subunits 3-nitrotyrosine, p47phox, p67 phox, Nox-4 and superoxide production significantly than vehicle-treated rats.\n In contrast myocardial protein levels of ACE-2, ANG 1-7 mas receptor were upregulated in the telmisartan treated group compared with those of vehicle-treated rats.\n The myocardial protein expression levels of tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)-associated factor (TRAF)-2, C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) and glucose-regulated protein (GRP) 78 were decreased in the telmisartan treated rats compared with those of vehicle-treated rats.\n In addition, telmisartan treatment significantly decreased the protein expression levels of phospho-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phospho-JNK, phospho-ERK and phospho (MAPK) activated protein kinase-2 than with those of vehicle-treated rats.\n Moreover, telmisartan significantly decreased the production of proinflammatory cytokines, myocardial apoptotic markers and caspase-3 positive cells compared with those of vehicle-treated rats.\n Therefore, we suggest that telmisartan was beneficial protection against heart failure in rats, at least in part by suppressing inflammation, oxidative stress, ER stress as well as signaling pathways through the modulation of ACE2/ANG1-7/Mas receptor axis.\n","id":"PMC3174385","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Ivyspring International

A first step in understanding SARS pathogenesis","abstract":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an acute infectious disease that spreads mainly via the respiratory route.\n A distinct coronavirus (SARS?CoV) has been identified as the aetiological agent of SARS.\n Recently, a metallopeptidase named angiotensin?converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as the functional receptor for SARS?CoV.\n Although ACE2 mRNA is known to be present in virtually all organs, its protein expression is largely unknown.\n Since identifying the possible route of infection has major implications for understanding the pathogenesis and future treatment strategies for SARS, the present study investigated the localization of ACE2 protein in various human organs (oral and nasal mucosa, nasopharynx, lung, stomach, small intestine, colon, skin, lymph nodes, thymus, bone marrow, spleen, liver, kidney, and brain).\n The most remarkable finding was the surface expression of ACE2 protein on lung alveolar epithelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine.\n Furthermore, ACE2 was present in arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells in all organs studied.\n In conclusion, ACE2 is abundantly present in humans in the epithelia of the lung and small intestine, which might provide possible routes of entry for the SARS?CoV.\n This epithelial expression, together with the presence of ACE2 in vascular endothelium, also provides a first step in understanding the pathogenesis of the main SARS disease manifestations.\n Copyright © 2004 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.\n Published by John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.\n","id":"PMC7167720","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"I","surname":"Hamming","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"W","surname":"Timens","email":"w.timens@path.azg.nl","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"MLC","surname":"Bulthuis","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"AT","surname":"Lely","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"GJ","surname":"Navis","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"H","surname":"van Goor","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1152/physrev.00023.2016","date":"2017-06-18","title":"The ACE2/Angiotensin-(1–7)/MAS Axis of the Renin-Angiotensin System: Focus on Angiotensin-(1–7)","abstract":"The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is a key player in the control of the cardiovascular system and hydroelectrolyte balance, with an influence on organs and functions throughout the body.\n The classical view of this system saw it as a sequence of many enzymatic steps that culminate in the production of a single biologically active metabolite, the octapeptide angiotensin (ANG) II, by the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE).\n The past two decades have revealed new functions for some of the intermediate products, beyond their roles as substrates along the classical route.\n They may be processed in alternative ways by enzymes such as the ACE homolog ACE2. One effect is to establish a second axis through ACE2/ANG-(1–7)/MAS, whose end point is the metabolite ANG-(1–7).\n ACE2 and other enzymes can form ANG-(1–7) directly or indirectly from either the decapeptide ANG I or from ANG II.\n In many cases, this second axis appears to counteract or modulate the effects of the classical axis.\n ANG-(1–7) itself acts on the receptor MAS to influence a range of mechanisms in the heart, kidney, brain, and other tissues.\n This review highlights the current knowledge about the roles of ANG-(1–7) in physiology and disease, with particular emphasis on the brain.\n","id":"PMC7203574","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"American Physiological Society","authors":[{"firstname":"Robson Augusto

Pandemic","abstract":"During the spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2, some reports of data still emerging and in need of full analysis indicate that certain groups of patients are at risk of COVID-19. This includes patients with hypertension, heart disease, diabetes mellitus, and clearly the elderly.\n Many of those patients are treated with renin-angiotensin system blockers.\n Because the ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) protein is the receptor that facilitates coronavirus entry into cells, the notion has been popularized that treatment with renin-angiotensin system blockers might increase the risk of developing a severe and fatal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection.\n The present article discusses this concept.\n ACE2 in its full-length form is a membrane-bound enzyme, whereas its shorter (soluble) form circulates in blood at very low levels.\n As a mono-carboxypeptidase, ACE2 contributes to the degradation of several substrates including angiotensins I and II.\n ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors do not inhibit ACE2 because ACE and ACE2 are different enzymes.\n Although angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers have been shown to upregulate ACE2 in experimental animals, the evidence is not always consistent and differs among the diverse angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers and differing organs.\n Moreover, there are no data to support the notion that ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker administration facilitates coronavirus entry by increasing ACE2 expression in either animals or humans.\n Indeed, animal data support elevated ACE2 expression as conferring potential protective pulmonary and cardiovascular effects.\n In summary, based on the currently available evidence, treatment with renin-angiotensin system blockers should not be discontinued because of concerns with coronavirus infection.\n","id":"PMC7225046","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Lippincott, Williams &amp; Wilkins","authors":[{"firstname":"A.H.

On 20 January 2020, the National Health Commission issued No. 1 announcement, which included COVID-19 as an acute respiratory infectious disease into the class B infectious disease specified in the law of the people's Republic of China on the prevention and control of infectious diseases, and then managed it as class A infectious disease. The COVID-19 epidemic situation was classified as &quot;public health emergencies of international concern&quot; on 31st January, the highest level in the World Health Organization (WHO) infectious disease emergency mechanism by WHO.\nThere was of particular interest to clinicians and investigators with a major interest in cardiovascular disease and mortality on infected patients, particularly in elderly people with comorbidities. subsequently, in an analysis of 45 000 confirmed cases in China, the crude case fatality rate was 0.9% for patients without any documented comorbidities, whereas the case fatality rate was much higher for patients with cardiovascular disease (10.5%), diabetes (7.3%), or hypertension (6.3%).\nWell, now the current study reports that hypertension may be associated with an increased risk of severe in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Previous experimental data revealed angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors serve as binding sites for the anchoring spike (S) proteins on the exterior surfaces of beta coronaviruses. The beta coronavirus SARS-CoV causes the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The phylogenetically related beta coronavirus, SARS-Cov-2, causes the novel coronavirus disease (nCoV-2019) or COVID-19. S proteins anchor both beta coronaviruses to ACE2 receptors in the lower respiratory tract of infected patients to gain entry into the lungs. Viral pneumonia and potentially fatal respiratory failure may result in susceptible persons after 10 to 14 days.\nCurrently, the hypertension patients are basically treated with blood pressure-lowering drugs, mainly including renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers-angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs)/angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), calcium channel blockers (CCBs), beta-blockers, diuretics. In Southwest China, CCBs accounted for 58.6% of hypertension treatment, followed by ACEIs/ARBs accounted for 22.4%. Since ACE2 was identified to the functional receptor of SARS-CoV-2. ACE2 level was increased following treatment with ACEIs and ARBs. The current research revealed that intravenous infusions of ACEIs and ARBs in experimental animals increased the numbers of ACE2 receptors in the cardiopulmonary circulation. Patients taking ACEIs or ARBs chronically for cardiovascular diseases are assumed to have increased numbers of ACE2 receptors throughout their cardiopulmonary circulations as observed in experimental animal models.\nCurrently, a corollary concern needed to identify through real-world clinical studies, whether these commonly used RAS blockers:ACEIs/ARBs may increase the severity of COVID-19. The present study therefore retrospectively analyzed data from hospitalized COVID-19 patients with hypertension in a single center in Wuhan, China, to compare the difference between ACEIs/ARBs and CCB groups, which may provide clinical evidence on the impact of ACEIs/ARBs on the clinical course of COVID-19 infection.\nMETHODS\nStudy patients\nWe performed a retrospective study of COVID-19 patients with hypertension who were recorded in Tongji Hospital Affiliated to Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China from 25th January to 15th March 2020. COVID-19 was diagnosed via epidemiological history (Travel history or residence history in Wuhan and surrounding areas or other communities with case reports within 14 days before the onset of illness; history of exposure to COVID-19 case infection within 14 days before onset of illness and so on), consistent with two clinical manifestations (fever and respiratory symptoms, normal or decreased white blood cells in early onset of illness), and microbiological evidence (laboratory test for the COVID-19 from the respiratory specimens shows positive result by the real-time reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR] assay) according to the Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Guideline (7th edition, in Chinese) published by the National Health Commission of China. Hypertension history and blood pressure medications Obtained through electronic medical record (EMR). Patients demographics as well as the use of antihypertensive drug, therapy protocol, imaging data, laboratory data, follow-up records, and prognosis were collected from EMR. Routine tests, such as chest computed tomography (CT), serum biochemical indices, and complete blood counts were conducted during hospitalization.\nFrom 25th January to 15th March 2020, 306 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 combined hypertension using CCBs, ACEIs, or ARBs antihypertensive drugs. Patients with the following conditions were excluded from our study: (a) lung imaging was significantly improved before using antihypertensive; (b) before using antihypertensive, ucleic acid was negative for two consecutive times; (c) case use both CCBs and ACEIs/ARBs. This study was approved by the institutional ethics board of the Tongji Hospital Affiliated to Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology (No. TJ-IRB20200338).\nAccording to the Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Guideline (7th edition, in Chinese), clinical classification of the COVID-19 patients was classified into mild-moderate, severe, and critically ill. Baseline clinical data were collected at admission, including blood routine, such as white blood cell count (3.5-9.5) x 109/L, lymphocyte count (1.1-3.2) x 109/L, coagulation function such as D-dimer less than 0.5 mg/L, renal and liver function, such as alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase less than 40 U/L, creatinine (59-104 U/L), uric acid (202.3-416.5 mmol/L), urea (3.6-9.5 mmol/L), electrolytes such as potassium (3.5-5.1 mmol/L), sodium (136-145 mmol/L), C-reactive protein (CRP) less than 5 mg/L, myocardial enzymes such as NT-ProBNP less than 241 pg/mL, cytokine such as interleukin-6 less than 7 mmol. These were collected routinely on admission. Radiologically, the area of affected lungs consistent with viral pneumonia in each patient's first chest CT after admission was measured and classified into one or two lungs. During hospitalization, lesion progression in chest CT was recorded. RT-PCR assay was used to analyze the SARS-CoV-2 viral nucleic acid. The outcome data were collected prospectively by physicians who un-knew the study group. The main improvement measures were the time from illness onset to negative nucleic acid for two time and chest CT gradually improved, and we selected firstly nucleic acid conversion time and chest CT improved. The secondary endpoints were worsened Chest CT during hospitalization and in-hospital mortality. The outcome measures were the time from illness onset to discharge from hospital.\nStatistical analysis\nContinuous data accorded with normal distribution were expressed as mean +- standard deviation and compared by independent samples t test or expressed as median (25th-75th percentile) and compared by the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Categorical variables were expressed as number (percentage) and compared by chi 2 test or Fisher's exact test. Among patients diagnosed with COVID-19 combined hypertension using CCBs, ACEIs, or ARBs antihypertensive drugs, we sought to investigate the ACEIs or ARBs medication on progress and prognosis of COVID-19 patients. The main improvement measures, such as the first nucleic acid conversion time, first chest CT improved time and outcome measures such as the hospitalization time was also calculated. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression models were used to describe the progression and prognosis of COVID-19 patients between CCBs and ACEIs/ARBs. To account for sample size, we selected the variables with P &lt; .05 which were significantly associated with outcome measures in the univariable analysis. One-to-one (1:1) propensity score matching (PSM) was conducted to construct a matched sample consisting of pairs of CCBs and ACEIs/ARBs subjects by optimal matching algorithm. Variables that were significantly different between the two groups were utilized to generate propensity scores. Specifically, we also conducted a stratified analysis with respect to outcome measures by age, gender, clinical classification, comorbidities, temperature, respiratory rate, diastolic blood pressure (BP), systolic BP, heart rate, white blood cell count, lymphocyte count, D-dimer, interleukin-6, interleukin-2 receptor, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, lung image, NT-ProBNP, creatinine, urea, uric acid, potassium, sodium, and CRP, which was used to perform PSM. The data were imported and analyzed using R language (3.6.2 ed, 2019), implemented in RStudio (Version 1.2.5003 ed, 2015). Package MatchIt, survival, and survminer were employed for PSM and survival analysis, separately, with a two-sided P value of less than .05 considered statistically significant.\nRESULTS\nStudy the selected population\nIn total, 306 patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 combined hypertension using CCBs, ACEIs, or ARBs antihypertensive drugs between 25th January 2020 to 15th March 2020. The patient selection flow-chart is displayed in Figure 1. All these patients were treated with one or multiple blood pressure-lowering drugs, including RAS blockers:ACEIs/ARBs, calcium channel blockers, beta-Blockers, and diuretics. The ACEIs/ARBs group consisted of ACEIs or ARBs without CCBs, as well as CCBs group. Then, we selected 157 adult hypertension patients with COVID-19 infections, including 73 males (46.50%) and 84 females (53.50%). The vast majority of patients were discharged from hospital. Unfortunately, there were five patients and one patient died from pneumonia in ACEIs/ARBs and CCBs groups, respectively. The in-hospital mortality showed no significant difference between two groups (P = .191). After PSM, we selected 76 adult hypertension patients with COVID-19 infections (Figures S1 and S2).\nFlow-chart for patient selection\nComparison of demographic and clinical characteristics\nBefore PSM, a total of 157 adult hypertension patients with COVID-19 infections were involved in this study. Demographic features and clinical characteristics data are shown in Table 1. There is no obvious difference between ACEIs/ARBs and CCBs groups about 49 (59.0) vs 35 (47.3) female, a median age of 67.28 +- 9.11 vs 65.39 +- 10.85 years (P &gt; .05). Compared with the respiratory rate 21.39 +- 7.22 or 19.96 +- 2.42, diastolic BP 83.23 +- 11.88 or 81.81 +- 13.47 mm Hg, systolic BP 138.66 +- 17.97 or 134.76 +- 18.53 mm Hg, Heart rate 89.01 +- 14.35 or 89.19 +- 17.62 bpm, respectively, we found that antihypertensive drugs in ACEIs/ARBs and CCBs groups exhibited a similarly antihypertensive efficacy. The underlying diseases, including diabetes mellitus and coronary disease, in ACEIs/ARBs and CCBs groups are listed in Table 2. There was no significant difference between two groups, as well as lymphocytes count (x109/L)1.26 +- 0.53 vs 1.29 +- 0.60, D-dimer (mg/L) 1.43 +- 2.04 vs 1.38 +- 1.59, interleukin-6 18.51 +- 32.41 vs 24.11 +- 52.72 mmol/L, interleukin-2 receptor 32.69 +- 490.99 vs 752.82 +- 550.00 mmol/L, and CRP 29.57 +- 47.25 vs 24.25 +- 50.47 mg/L. The clinical severity was graded as mild-moderate, severe, and critically ill. There is no difference in any of grade between ACEIs/ARBs and CCBs groups. It is worth noting that the significant differences between ACEIs/ARBs group and CCBs group on temperature 36.92 C +- 0.84 C vs 37.69 C +- 0.75C, white blood cell count (x109/L) 5.92 +- 2.28 vs 7.54 +- 2.31, aspartate aminotransferase 22.82 +- 13.42 vs 29.95 +- 16.61 U/L. To further evaluate the detected differences between ACEIs/ARBs and CCBs groups, we performed a 1:1 matched case-control analysis using the PSM method. PSM between the ACEIs/ARBs and CCBs groups was conducted by all variables (age, gender, clinical classification, comorbidities, temperature, respiratory rate, diastolic BP, systolic BP, heart rate, white blood cell count, lymphocytes count, D-dimer, interleukin-6, interleukin-2 receptor, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, lung image, NT-ProBNP, creatinine, urea, uric acid, potassium, sodium, and CRP). After PSM, the ACEIs/ARBs and CCBs groups consisted of 38 patients, respectively. No statistical differences on demographic features and clinical characteristics data were observed between the two groups.\nComparison of demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 between ACEIs/ARBs and CCBs groups\n	Before PSM	After PSM	 	Characteristics ID	CCBs group (n = 83)	ACEIs/ARBs group (n = 74)	P	CCBs group (n = 38)	ACEIs /ARBs group (n = 38)	P	 	Gender = female (%)	49 (59.0)	35 (47.3)	.19	22 (57.9)	22 (57.9)	1	 	Age (mean +- SD)	67.28 +- 9.11	65.39 +- 10.85	.239	65.34 +- 9.65	68.16 +- 7.58	.162	 	Outcome = cure (%)	82 (98.8)	69 (93.2)	.163	38 (100.0)	38 (100.0)	1	 	Clinical classification (%)			.191			.818	 	Mild-moderate (%)	44 (53.0)	38 (51.4)					 	Severe (%)	38 (45.8)	31 (41.9)		16 (42.1)	18 (47.4)		 	Critically ill (%)	1 (1.2)	5 (6.8)					 	Diabetes (%)	22 (26.5)	21 (28.4)	.934	9 (23.7)	12 (31.6)	.608	 	coronary disease (%)	6 (7.2)	10 (13.5)	.301	3 (7.9)	5 (13.2)	.709	 	Temperature (mean +- SD)	36.92 +- 0.84	37.69 +- 0.75	.012	36.85 +- 0.83	36.73 +- 0.74	.505	 	Respiratory rate (breaths per min) (mean +- SD)	21.39 +- 7.22	19.96 +- 2.42	.107	20.18 +- 2.99	20.11 +- 2.08	.894	 	diastolic BP (mean +- SD), mm Hg	83.23 +- 11.88	81.81 +- 13.47	.484	83.45 +- 11.72	82.66 +- 12.69	.779	 	systolic BP (mean +- SD), mm Hg	138.66 +- 17.97	134.76 +- 18.53	.182	140.53 +- 17.97	136.03 +- 18.58	.287	 	Heart rate (mean +- SD), bpm	89.01 +- 14.35	89.19 +- 17.62	.945	89.13 +- 13.71	88.82 +- 14.03	.921	 	White blood cell count (x109/L) (mean +- SD)	5.92 +- 2.28	7.54 +- 2.31	.019	6.53 +- 2.54	6.62 +- 2.42	.887	 	lymphocyte count (x109/L) (mean +- SD)	1.26 +- 0.53	1.29 +- 0.60	.757	1.38 +- 0.61	1.26 +- 0.55	.38	 	D-dimer (mean +- SD), mg/L	1.43 +- 2.04	1.38 +- 1.59	.874	1.08 +- 1.55	1.49 +- 1.66	.267	 	Interleukin-6 (mean +- SD), mmol/L	18.51 +- 32.41	24.11 +- 52.72	.419	14.97 +- 30.09	15.54 +- 27.05	.932	 	Interleukin-2 receptor (mean +- SD), mmol/L	732.69 +- 490.99	752.82 +- 550.00	.809	631.87 +- 422.94	758.95 +- 393.16	.179	 	Alanine aminotransferase (mean +- SD), U/L	26.04 +- 23.08	31.46 +- 21.82	.134	26.03 +- 20.99	26.42 +- 16.25	.927	 	Aspartate aminotransferase (mean +- SD), U/L	22.82 +- 13.42	29.95 +- 16.61	.037	22.95 +- 13.44	22.92 +- 9.71	.992	 	lung image (%)	75 (90.4)	65 (87.8)	.802	32 (84.2)	35 (92.1)	.478	 	NT-ProBNP (mean +- SD), pg/L	1305.13 +- 7258.23	294.00 +- 385.08	.233	164.18 +- 263.02	306.11 +- 442.72	.094	 	Creatinine (mean +- SD), U/L	93.17 +- 116.46	80.32 +- 43.05	.372	71.16 +- 17.44	76.32 +- 39.31	.462	 	Urea (mean +- SD), mmol/L	5.69 +- 4.94	5.73 +- 3.45	.957	4.79 +- 1.52	5.11 +- 1.96	.431	 	Uric acid (mean +- SD), mmol/L	268.24 +- 82.61	285.67 +- 116.59	.277	276.84 +- 83.11	264.35 +- 97.42	.549	 	Potassium (mean +- SD), mmol/L	4.25 +- 0.56	4.22 +- 0.47	.772	4.14 +- 0.44	4.24 +- 0.50	.345	 	Sodium (mean +- SD), mmol/L	140.10 +- 2.90	139.45 +- 3.83	.223	140.31 +- 2.83	140.32 +- 3.05	.997	 	C-reactive protein (mean +- SD), mg/L	29.57 +- 47.25	24.25 +- 50.47	.496	13.45 +- 21.30	17.88 +- 25.46	.413	 	\nAbbreviations: ACEI, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor;

Furthermore, we included all variables mentioned earlier in the multivariable analysis. After adjustment for potential confounders, we found no obvious difference in nucleic acid conversion time between ACEIs/ARBs group and CCBs group (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI]: [0.97, 3.38]; P = .18) (Table 2).\nA, Cox regression analysis curve of nucleic acid conversion time of COVID-19 patients with hypertension (after PSM).

As showed in Table 4, univariate Cox regression analysis identified six prognosis factors for hospitalization time: clinical classification (P &lt; .001), lymphocyte count (P = .012) and interleukin-2 receptor (P = .025), lung image (P = .037), uric acid (P = .045), potassium (P = .0086) (Figure 2C). Next, multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to determine if these variables were independently related to hospitalization time. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that no obvious difference in the hospitalization time between ACEIs/ARBs group and CCBs group (HR: 1.06; 95% CI: [0.44, 1.1]; P = .83) (Table 4).\nUnivariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis for the hospitalization time\nCharacteristics	HR	P value	95% CL	 	ID	Lower	Upper	 	Univariate					 	Gender	0.83	.44	0.52	1.3	 	Age	0.98	.17	0.95	1	 	Clinical classification	0.13	3.40E-11	0.072	0.24	 	Diabetes	1.4	.16	0.86	2.4	 	Coronary disease	1.1	.8	0.52	2.3	 	Temperature	1.2	.3	0.87	1.6	 	Respiratory rate (breaths per min)	0.97	.54	0.88	1.1	 	Diastolic BP, mm Hg	1	.21	0.99	1	 	Systolic BP, mm Hg	1	.29	0.99	1	 	Heart rate, bpm	1	.91	0.98	1	 	White blood cell count (x109/L)	0.96	.32	0.87	1	 	Lymphpcyte count (x109/L)	1.7	.012	1.1	2.4	 	D-dimer, mg/L	0.93	.47	0.77	1.1	 	Interleukin-6, mmol/L	1	.64	0.99	1	 	Interleukin-2 receptor, mmol/L	1	.025	1	1	 	Alanine aminotransferase, U/L	1	.33	0.99	1	 	Aspartate aminotransferase, U/L	1	.84	0.98	1	 	Lung image	0.47	.037	0.23	0.95	 	NT-ProBNP, pg/L	1	.86	1	1	 	Creatinine, U/L	1	.68	0.99	1	 	Urea, mmol/L	0.92	.19	0.81	1	 	Uric acid, mmol/L	1	.045	1	1	 	Potassium, mmol/L	2	.0086	1.2	3.3	 	Sodium, mmol/L	0.95	.19	0.88	1	 	C-reactive protein, mg/L	0.99	.066	0.98	1	 	CCBs vs ACEI/ARBs groups	0.7	.13	0.44	1.1	 	Multivariate					 	Clinical classification	0.1114452	9.51E-10			 	Lymphpcyte count (x109/L)	1.408974	.1117			 	Interleukin-2 receptor	0.9994966	.1698			 	Lung image	0.5100719	.1009			 	Uric acid	1.0030762	.0347			 	Potassium	1.5275902	.1536			 	CCBs vs ACEI/ARBs groups	1.0559883	.8353			 	\nAbbreviations: ACEI, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor; ARB, angiotensin receptor blocker; BP, blood pressure; CCB, calcium channel blocker; CI, confidence interval; HR, hazard ratio.\nDISCUSSION\nDuring the spread of the SARS-CoV-2, some reports of data still emerging and in need of full analysis indicated that certain groups of patients are at risk of COVID-19, especially complicated with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and coronary artery disease. Currently, hypertension patients are basically treated with blood pressure-lowering drugs, mainly including RAS blockers:ACEIs/ARBs, CCBs, beta-blockers, diuretics. However, it has been popularized in clinical treatment that RAS blockers might increase the risk of developing a severe and fatal SARS-CoV-2 infection. Until now, the distinct effects of antihypertensives on prognosis remains unclear. The present study therefore retrospectively analyzed data from hospitalized COVID-19 patients with hypertension in a single center in Wuhan, China, to compare the difference between ACEIs/ARBs groups and CCB groups, which may provide clinical evidence on the impact of ACEIs/ARBs on the clinical course of COVID-19 infection.\nUpon sufficient consideration of the relationship that ACE2 was the receptor that allowed coronavirus entry into cells, ACE2 overexpression facilitated the replication in cells that were otherwise resistant to the virus. In the RAAS, ACE2 catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin II to angiotensin 1 to 7, which acts as a vasodilator and exerts protective effects in the cardiovascular system. In animal experiments, increased expression and activity of ACE2 in various organs including the heart were found in connection with ACEIs and ARBs administration. In addition, more recent data showing increased urinary secretion of ACE2 in hypertensive patients treated with the ARB olmesartan suggest that the upregulation of ACE2 may also occur in humans. These observations have been reiterated in the literature and on the web in recent days and the question arose whether RAAS inhibition may increase the risk of the deleterious outcome of COVID-19 through upregulation of ACE2 and increase of viral load.\nNevertheless, we analyzed the clinical characteristics of 76 essential hypertension patients with COVID-19 and then found a significant difference in nucleic acid time between two groups in all univariable (P = .036) in the univariable analysis. Specifically, compared with CCBs, we observed that clinical classification (P = 1.20E-08), lymphocyte count (P = .032), and interleukin-2 receptor (P = .045) were significantly associated with a lengthened negative time of nucleic acid of ACEI and ARB in univariable analysis. For further confirmation, we included all variables mentioned earlier in the multivariable analysis. After adjustment for potential confounders, we found no obvious difference in nucleic acid conversion time between ACEIs/ARBs and CCBs groups (HR: 0.70; 95% CI: [0.97, 3.38]; P = .18). Which indicated no clinical data providing a causal relationship between RAS blockers and SARS-CoV2 associated increasing the entry and replication of viral.\nRAS blockers such as ACEIs and ARBs were highly recommended medications for patients with cardiovascular diseases, such as refractory hypertension, coronary artery disease, heart failure, and postmyocardial infarction status. Especially if elderly hypertensive patients suffered with cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and renal insufficiency, with the highest level of evidence with regard to mortality reduction Given that ACEIs/ARBs increase ACE2 expression and activity in the heart and kidneys in normotensive or hypertensive rats. ACE2 was also universally expressed in the heart, liver, kidney, blood vessels, and other tissues. Several studies evidenced that ACEIs/ARBs prevent the progression of pulmonary complications in vulnerable populations, and reduce severe lung injury in certain viral pneumonias. Therefore, there is conflicting evidence that the use of ACEIs/ARBs has a positive or negative impact on COVID-19. For this reason, we try to shed light on the relationship between the usage of ACEIs/ARBs and the lung injury of COVID-19 combined hypertension in the real-world study. We screened and analyzed the clinical data and found that no obvious difference in chest CT improved time between ACEIs/ARBs group and CCBs group (HR: 0.73; 95% CI: [0.45, 1.2]; P = .87) by the univariable and multivariable analysis.\nAlthough the possible upregulation of ACE2 by RAAS inhibition and the theoretically associated risk of a higher susceptibility to infection, there is no direct evidence proving a causal relationship between ACE2 activity and SARS-CoV2 associated mortality. Consequently, we try to evaluate differences among antihypertensive drugs on the outcome measures of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 combined hypertension. Until now, our current study manifested that no statistical differences in the in-hospital mortality between ACEIs/ARBs and CCBs groups. We also evaluate the difference in ACEIs/ARBs on the outcome measures of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 combined hypertension and found no obvious difference in the hospitalization time between ACEIs/ARBs and CCBs groups (HR: 1.06; 95% CI: [0.44, 1.1]; P = .83) by the univariable and multivariable analysis. ACEIs/ARBs did not increase the risk of extended course and poor prognosis of hypertension patients with COVID-19. Notwithstanding there was conflicting evidence about the use of ACEIs/ARBs in the context of the pandemic COVID-19 outbreak, our research suggested continuation of usual ACEIs/ARBs treatment for hypertension patients with COVID-19.\nLimitations\nOur study has several limitations. First, only 76 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were included, and a larger cohort study is needed to verify our conclusions. Second, as a retrospective study, some other specific information regarding cardiovascular complications such as echocardiography were not presented in the study because the data were incomplete owing to the limited conditions in the isolation ward and the urgency of containing the COVID-19 epidemic. Third, we did not observe mild cases who were treated at home. Four, we did not observe who changed past usage of ACEIs/ARBs medication at home to CCBs in hospital.\nConclusion\nHere, the current analysis shows that as compared with CCBs, ACEIs/ARBs did not increase the risk of extended course and poor prognosis of hypertension patients with COVID-19. However, long-term observation and prospective study design on the difference between the ACEIs/ARBs and non-ACEIs/ARBs are needed.\nCONFLICT OF INTERESTS\nThe authors declare that there are no conflict of interests.\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nJL and DL conceived and designed the study.

therapeutics","abstract":"At the time of writing this commentary (February 2020), the coronavirus COVID?19 epidemic has already resulted in more fatalities compared with the SARS and MERS coronavirus epidemics combined.\n Therapeutics that may assist to contain its rapid spread and reduce its high mortality rates are urgently needed.\n Developing vaccines against the SARS?CoV?2 virus may take many months.\n Moreover, vaccines based on viral?encoded peptides may not be effective against future coronavirus epidemics, as virus mutations could make them futile.\n Indeed, new Influenza virus strains emerge every year, requiring new immunizations.\n A tentative suggestion based on existing therapeutics, which would likely be resistant to new coronavirus mutations, is to use available angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1R) blockers, such as losartan, as therapeutics for reducing the aggressiveness and mortality from SARS?CoV?2 virus infections.\n This idea is based on observations that the angiotensin?converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) very likely serves as the binding site for SARS?CoV?2, the strain implicated in the current COVID?19 epidemic, similarly to strain SARS?CoV implicated in the 2002–2003 SARS epidemic.\n This commentary elaborates on the idea of considering AT1R blockers as tentative treatment for SARS?CoV?2 infections, and proposes a research direction based on datamining of clinical patient records for assessing its feasibility.\n","id":"PMC7228359","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley &amp; Sons,

caused 104 infections in people including 49 deaths, with 82 cases and 41 deaths reported from Saudi Arabia.\n\n In addition to confirming diagnosis, we generated the MERS-CoV genomic sequences obtained directly from patient samples to provide important information on MERS-CoV transmission, evolution, and origin.\n\n\nMethods\nFull genome deep sequencing was done on nucleic acid extracted directly from PCR-confirmed clinical samples.\n\n Viral genomes were obtained from 21 MERS cases of which 13 had 100%, four 85–95%, and four 30–50% genome coverage.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of the 21 sequences, combined with nine published MERS-CoV genomes, was done.\n\n\nFindings\nThree distinct MERS-CoV genotypes were identified in Riyadh.\n\n Phylogeographic analyses suggest the MERS-CoV zoonotic reservoir is geographically disperse.\n\n Selection analysis of the MERS-CoV genomes reveals the expected accumulation of genetic diversity including changes in the S protein.\n\n The genetic diversity in the Al-Hasa cluster suggests that the hospital outbreak might have had more than one virus introduction.\n\n\nInterpretation\nWe present the largest number of MERS-CoV genomes (21) described so far.\n\n MERS-CoV full genome sequences provide greater detail in tracking transmission.\n\n Multiple introductions of MERS-CoV are identified and suggest lower R0 values.\n\n Transmission within Saudi Arabia is consistent with either movement of an animal reservoir, animal products, or movement of infected people.\n\n Further definition of the exposures responsible for the sporadic introductions of MERS-CoV into human populations is urgently needed.\n\n\nFunding\nSaudi Arabian Ministry of Health, Wellcome Trust, European Community, and National Institute of Health

Importantly, strains with high genetic similarity to SARS-CoV in the hypervariable N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 gene, the ORF3 and ORF8 region, respectively, were all discovered in this cave.\n In addition, we report the first discovery of bat SARSr-CoVs highly similar to human SARS-CoV in ORF3b and in the split ORF8a and 8b.\n Moreover, SARSr-CoV strains from this cave were more closely related to SARS-CoV in the non-structural protein genes ORF1a and 1b compared with those detected elsewhere.\n Recombination analysis shows evidence of frequent recombination events within the S gene and around the ORF8 between these SARSr-CoVs.\n We hypothesize that the direct progenitor of SARS-CoV may have originated after sequential recombination events between the precursors of these SARSr-CoVs.\n Cell entry studies demonstrated that three newly identified SARSr-CoVs with different S protein sequences are all able to use human ACE2 as the receptor, further exhibiting the close relationship between strains in this cave and SARS-CoV.\n This work provides new insights into the origin and evolution of SARS-CoV and highlights the necessity of preparedness for future emergence of SARS-like diseases.\n","id":"PMC5708621","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Ben","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei-Ping","surname":"Zeng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xing-Lou","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xing-Yi","surname":"Ge","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bei","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jia-Zheng","surname":"Xie","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xu-Rui","surname":"Shen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yun-Zhi","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ning","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dong-Sheng","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiao-Shuang","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mei-Niang","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peter","surname":"Daszak","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin-Fa","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin-Fa","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jie","surname":"Cui","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng-Li","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng-Li","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christian","surname":"Drosten","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christian","surname":"Drosten","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christian","surname":"Drosten","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1128/JVI.06882-11","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Evidence for a common evolutionary origin of coronavirus spike protein receptor-binding subunits","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1126/science.1116480","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Structure of SARS coronavirus spike receptor-binding domain complexed with receptor","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00255","date":"1970-01-01","title":"ff14SB: improving the accuracy of protein side chain and backbone parameters from ff99SB","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1038/nature12005","date":"2013-02-13","title":"Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 is a functional receptor for the emerging human coronavirus-EMC","abstract":"Supplementary information\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1038/nature12005) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7095326","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing Group UK","authors":[{"firstname":"V.

The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and

through viviparity","abstract":"Polyphenism, in which multiple discrete phenotypes develop from a single genotype, is considered to have contributed to the evolutionary success of aphids.\n Of the various polyphenisms observed in the complex life cycle of aphids, the reproductive and wing polyphenisms seen in most aphid species are conspicuous.\n In reproductive polyphenism, the reproductive modes can change between viviparous parthenogenesis and sexual reproduction in response to the photoperiod.\n Under short-day conditions in autumn, sexual morphs (males and oviparous females) are produced parthenogenetically.\n Winged polyphenism is observed in viviparous generations during summer, when winged or wingless (flightless) aphids are produced depending on a variety of environmental conditions (e.\ng.\n, density, predators).\n Here, we review the physiological mechanisms underlying reproductive and wing polyphenism in aphids.\n In reproductive polyphenism, morph determination (male, oviparous or viviparous female) within mother aphids is regulated by juvenile hormone (JH) titers in the mothers.\n In wing polyphenism, although JH is considered to play an important role in phenotype determination (winged or wingless), the role is still controversial.\n In both cases, the acquisition of viviparity in Aphididae is considered to be the basis for maternal regulation of these polyphenisms, and through which environmental cues can be transferred to developing embryos through the physiological state of the mother.\n Although the mechanisms by which mothers alter the developmental programs of their progeny have not yet been clarified, continued developments in molecular biology will likely unravel these questions.\n","id":"PMC3900772","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Frontiers Media

abrogate the effects of the hypertensive and mitogenic peptide, angiotensin II, by antagonising its interaction with its receptor, or by inhibiting its formative enzyme, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE).\n At the turn of the millennium, a homologous enzyme, termed ACE2, was identified which increasingly shares the limelight with its better-known homologue.\n In common with ACE, ACE2 is a type I transmembrane metallopeptidase; however, unlike ACE, ACE2 functions as a carboxypeptidase, cleaving a single C-terminal residue from a distinct range of substrates.\n One such substrate is angiotensin II, which is hydrolysed by ACE2 to the vasodilatory peptide angiotensin 1–7. In this commentary we discuss the latest developments in the rapidly progressing study of the physiological and patho-physiological roles of ACE2 allied with an overview of the current understanding of its molecular and cell biology.\n We also discuss parallel developments in the study of collectrin, a catalytically inactive homologue of ACE2 with critical functions in the pancreas and kidney.\n","id":"PMC7111199","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Inc.","authors":[{"firstname":"Daniel W.","surname":"Lambert","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nigel M.","surname":"Hooper","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Anthony J.","surname":"Turner","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.3109/10641963.2015.1060985","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Synergistic effects of gene polymorphisms of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system on essential hypertension in Kazakhs in Xinjiang","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"ACE2 polymorphisms associated with cardiovascular risk in Uygurs with type 2 diabetes mellitus","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"IDF Diabetes Atlas: global estimates for the prevalence of diabetes for 2015 and 2040","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/S2213-8587(15)00508-2","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Risk of non-fatal cardiovascular diseases in early-onset versus late-onset type 2 diabetes in China: a cross-sectional study","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Impact of age at diagnosis and duration of type 2 diabetes on mortality in Australia 1997-2011","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1001/jama.2017.7596","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Prevalence and ethnic pattern of diabetes and prediabetes in China in 2013","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.jacc.2014.12.044","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Status of cardiovascular health in Chinese adults","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1177/2047487316667784","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Lifestyle and risk factor management in people at high risk of cardiovascular disease.

lipid profile (LDL-C, TGs, and HDL-C) observed with commonly prescribed medications for patients with T2DM, including antihyperglycemic agents, antihypertensive agents, weight loss medications, antibiotics, analgesics, oral contraceptives, and hormone replacement therapies.\n Given that the risk of ASCVD is already elevated for patients with T2DM, the use of polypharmacy may warrant close observation of overall alterations through ongoing lipid-panel monitoring.\n Ultimately, the goal is to reduce levels of atherogenic cholesterol particles and thus the patient’s absolute risk.\n","id":"PMC4946113","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Paul

loci identified for cardio-metabolic traits in a Korean population","abstract":"Background\nThe genetic contribution to complex diseases or traits, including cardio-metabolic traits, has been elucidated recently by large-scale genome-wide association studies.\n\n These genome-wide association studies have indicated that most pleiotropic loci contain genes associated with lipids.\n\n Clinically, lipid related abnormalities are strongly associated with other diseases such as type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease and hypertension.\n\n The aim of this study was to evaluate the shared genetic background of lipids and other cardio-metabolic traits.\n\n\nMethods\nWe conducted meta-analyses of the association between 157 published lipid-associated loci and 10 cardio-metabolic traits in 14,028 Korean individuals genotyped using the Exome chip (Illumina HumanExome BeadChip).\n\n We also examined whether the pleiotropic effects of such loci constituted independent (i.\n\ne.\n\n, biological) pleiotropy or mediated pleiotropy in these metabolic pathways.\n\n\nResults\nEighteen lipid-associated loci were significantly associated with one of six cardio-metabolic traits after correction for multiple testing (P &lt; 3.70 × 10?4).\n\n Region 12q24.12 had pleiotropic effects on fasting plasma glucose, blood pressure and obesity-related traits (body mass index and waist-hip ratio) independent of its effects on the lipid profile.\n\n Lipid risk scores, calculated according to whether or not subjects carried the risk allele for lipid traits, were significantly associated with fasting plasma glucose, blood pressure and obesity-related traits.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe 12q24.12 region showed ethnic-specific genetic pleiotropy among cardio-metabolic traits in this study.\n\n Our findings may help to account for molecular mechanisms based on shared genetic background underlying not only dyslipidemia, but also cardiovascular disease and type 2

associated with benefits for glycemic control, yet uptake of these devices continues to be low.\n\n Some barriers to device uptake may be modifiable through psychosocial intervention, but little is known about which barriers and which patients to target.\n\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\nWe surveyed 1,503 adult T1D Exchange participants (mean age 35.3 [SD 14.8] years, mean diagnosis duration 20.4 [SD 12.5] years) to investigate barriers to device uptake, understand profiles of device users versus nonusers, and explore differences by age and sex.\n\n Scales used were the Diabetes Distress Scale, Technology Use Attitudes (General and Diabetes-Specific), and Barriers to Device Use and Reasons for Discontinuing Devices.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMost commonly endorsed modifiable barriers were related to the hassle of wearing devices (47%) and disliking devices on one’s body (35%).\n\n CGM users (37%) were older than nonusers (mean 38.3 vs.\n\n 33.5 years), had diabetes for longer (22.9 vs.\n\n 18.8 years), had more positive technology attitudes (22.6–26.0 vs.\n\n 21.4–24.8), and reported fewer barriers to using diabetes technology than nonusers (3.3 vs.\n\n 4.3).\n\n The youngest age-group (18–25 years) had the lowest CGM (26% vs.\n\n 40–48%) and insulin pump (64% vs.\n\n 69–77%) uptake, highest diabetes distress (2.2 vs.\n\n 1.8–2.1), and highest HbA1c levels (8.3% [67 mmol/mol] vs.\n\n 7.2–7.4% [55–57 mmol/mol]).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nEfforts to increase device use need to target physical barriers to wearing devices.\n\n Because young adults had the lowest device uptake rates, highest distress, and highest HbA1c compared with older age-groups, they should be the focus of future interventions to increase device

CHD in T2D, whether rs10911021 was associated with levels of amino acids involved in the ?-glutamyl cycle or any conventional risk factors (CRFs) for CHD in the T2D participants.\n\n\nMethods\nFour UCLEB studies (n = 6531) had rs10911021 imputation, CHD in T2D, CRF and metabolomics data determined using a nuclear magnetic resonance based platform.\n\n\nResults\nThe expected direction of effect between rs10911021 and CHD in T2D was observed (1377 no CHD/160 CHD; minor allele OR 0.80, 95 % CI 0.60–1.06) although this was not statistically significant (p = 0.13).\n\n No association between rs10911021 and CHD was seen in non-T2D participants (11218 no CHD/1274 CHD; minor allele OR 1.00 95 % CIs 0.92–1.10).\n\n In T2D participants, while no associations were observed between rs10911021 and the nine amino acids measured, rs10911021 was associated with HDL-cholesterol (p = 0.0005) but the minor “protective” allele was associated with lower levels (?0.034 mmol/l per allele).\n\n Focusing more closely on the HDL-cholesterol subclasses measured, we observed that rs10911021 was associated with six large HDL particle measures in T2D (all p &lt; 0.001).\n\n No significant associations were seen in non-T2D subjects.\n\n\nConclusions\nOur findings are consistent with a true association between rs10911021 and CHD in T2D.\n\n The protective minor allele was associated with lower HDL-cholesterol and reductions in HDL particle traits.\n\n Our results indicate a complex relationship between rs10911021 and CHD in T2D.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online

cardiovascular disease","abstract":"id='Par1'>For many years, cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been the leading cause of death around the world.\n Often associated with CVD are comorbidities such as obesity, abnormal lipid profiles and insulin resistance.\n Insulin is a key hormone that functions as a regulator of cellular metabolism in many tissues in the human body.\n Insulin resistance is defined as a decrease in tissue response to insulin stimulation thus insulin resistance is characterized by defects in uptake and oxidation of glucose, a decrease in glycogen synthesis, and, to a lesser extent, the ability to suppress lipid oxidation.\n Literature widely suggests that free fatty acids are the predominant substrate used in the adult myocardium for ATP production, however, the cardiac metabolic network is highly flexible and can use other substrates, such as glucose, lactate or amino acids.\n During insulin resistance, several metabolic alterations induce the development of cardiovascular disease.\n For instance, insulin resistance can induce an imbalance in glucose metabolism that generates chronic hyperglycemia, which in turn triggers oxidative stress and causes an inflammatory response that leads to cell damage.\n Insulin resistance can also alter systemic lipid metabolism which then leads to the development of dyslipidemia and the well-known lipid triad: (1) high levels of plasma triglycerides, (2) low levels of high-density lipoprotein, and (3) the appearance of small dense low-density lipoproteins.\n This triad, along with endothelial dysfunction, which can also be induced by aberrant insulin signaling, contribute to atherosclerotic plaque formation.\n Regarding the systemic consequences associated with insulin resistance and the metabolic cardiac alterations, it can be concluded that insulin resistance in the myocardium generates damage by at least three different mechanisms: (1) signal transduction alteration, (2) impaired regulation of substrate metabolism, and (3) altered delivery of substrates to the myocardium.\n The aim of this review is to discuss the mechanisms associated with insulin resistance and the development of CVD.\n New therapies focused on decreasing insulin resistance may contribute to a decrease in both CVD and atherosclerotic plaque generation.\n","id":"PMC6119242","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

whether RAS inhibitors, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs), are associated with clinical outcomes remains unknown. COVID-19 patients with hypertension were enrolled to evaluate the effect of RAS inhibitors. We observed that patients receiving ACEI or ARB therapy had a lower rate of severe diseases and a trend toward a lower level of IL-6 in peripheral blood. In addition, ACEI or ARB therapy increased CD3 and CD8 T cell counts in peripheral blood and decreased the peak viral load compared to other antihypertensive drugs. This evidence supports the benefit of using ACEIs or ARBs to potentially contribute to the improvement of clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients with hypertension.\nIntroduction\nThe COVID-19 outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to endanger global health and to hamper the world economy. This outbreak started in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province. Unfortunately, currently, there is still no specific and effective treatment for COVID-19. Evidence shows that elderly people with SARS-CoV-2 infections and cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension, are at risk of developing severe cases. A hypertension survey from 2012 to 2015 reported that 23.2% of Chinese people &gt;=18 years of age had hypertension, whereas the prevalence of hypertension was &gt;55% among citizens &gt;=65 years of age. RAS plays an important role in regulating electrolyte balance and blood pressure and comprises two pathways: the ACE/Ang II/AT1R pathway and the ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas receptor pathway. Under normal physiological conditions, the activity of the ACE/Ang II/AT1R axis and the ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas receptor axis are in a dynamic equilibrium state, maintaining the normal function of the corresponding system. Similar to SARS, SARS-CoV-2 is believed to invade the host through the cell entry receptor ACE2. SARS-CoV infections reduce ACE2 expression, resulting in an imbalance between the ACE/Ang II/AT1R axis and the ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas receptor axis. Targeting the ACE/Ang II/AT1R axis is a novel therapeutic strategy for hypertension. ACEIs and ARAs not only inhibit the ACE/Ang II/AT1R pathway but also modulate the ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas receptor pathway. The dysfunction of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been observed in coronavirus infection disease (COVID-19) patients, but whether RAS inhibitors, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs), are associated with clinical outcomes remains unknown. Here, we aimed to evaluate the ability of RAS inhibitors to protect against COVID-19 in patients with hypertension.\nMethods\nThis study was approved by the Shenzhen Third People's Hospital Ethical Committee. Verbal informed consent was obtained from all patients or patients' family members. We performed a retrospective review of medical records from hospitalized patients with COVID-19 admitted to the Shenzhen Third People's Hospital from 11 January to 23 February 2020. The information on patients with hypertension was extracted from all enrolled COVID-19 patients. We reviewed the clinical data extracted from electronic medical records, including clinical symptoms, signs and laboratory findings. A commercial real-time PCR kit (GeneoDX Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) was used to detect SARS-CoV-2. Samples were considered positive if the cycle threshold value (Ct-value) less than 37 and negative if Ct-value more than 40. Samples with a Ct-value between 37 and 40 require confirmation by retesting. Samples identified as positive by the local laboratory were further validated by the key laboratory of the Shenzhen CDC. The severity of COVID-19 wasidentified during the hospitalization according to the guidelines established by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China. Therapeutic regimens for COVID-19 patients complied with guidelines established by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China. Hypertension was classified as Grade 1, Grade 2 and Grade 3 according to 2018 guidelines of the European Society of Hypertension (ESH). Hypertensive patients with COVID-19 were divided into two subgroups based on antihypertensive drug treatments. Detailed information on the enrolled patients is shown in supplementary Table S1. The SPSS 18.0 software package was used for statistical analysis. Measurement data are expressed as the median and interquartile range (IQR), and the difference between groups was compared by an unpaired t test. Count data are expressed as percentages, and the difference between groups was tested by the Chi-square test. P &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nResults\nA total of 417 COVID-19 patients were admitted to the Shenzhen Third People's Hospital as of 23 February 2020. Among these patients, 51 (12.23%) had hypertension. Nine patients (17.6%) with Grade 1hypertension did not take any antihypertensive drugs during hospitalization and were excluded from the subsequent analysis. The other 42 patients (82.4%) receiving antihypertensive therapy were included in further studies. The 42 analyzed patients were divided into two groups based on antihypertensive therapies: the ACEI/ARB group (17 patients) included patients treated with ACEI or ARB drugs, and the non-ACEI/ARB group (25 patients) included patients treated with other antihypertensive drugs, including calcium channel blockers (CCBs), beta-blockers and diuretics. Eight patients (32%) in the non-ACEI/ARB group and 5 patients (29.41%)in the ACEI/ARB group had other comorbidities, such as type 2 diabetes (T2D) and coronary heart disease (CHD). The vast majority of hypertensive patients had received the current therapeutic regimens shown in supplementary Table S1 for over one year. The blood pressure of patients was well-controlled with the above therapeutic regimens during hospitalization.\nThe comparison of baseline characteristics between the two groups is summarized in supplementary Table S2. The median age of the analyzed subjects was 64.5 years (IQR, 55.8-69.0 years), and 57.1% of them were males. No significant differences in hypertension grades were observed between the ACEI/ARB group and the non-ACEI/ARB group. Both groups showed similar signs and symptoms. The median number of days from the onset of symptoms to hospital admission was 2.0 in the non-ACEI/ARB group and 3.0 in the ACEI/ARB group. Meanwhile, the median number of days from symptom onset to hospital discharge was 16.5 days in the non-ACEI/ARB group and 20.0 days in the ACEI/ARB group. The median heart rate and respiratory rate from the non-ACEI/ARB group were 90.5 bpm and 20.0, respectively. In comparison, the median heart rate and respiratory rate from the non-ACEI/ARB group were 80.0 bmp and 20.0, respectively. All baseline characteristics shown in Table S2 were not significantly different between the two groups.\nSummarized clinical, inflammatory, immunological, and viral findings in the non-ACEI/ARB group and the ACE/ARB group. (A) The disease severity distribution of the two groups during hospitalization. (B) The levels of IL-6 and CRP in peripheral blood. (C) Absolute numbers of CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells in peripheral blood. (D) Viral load on hospital admission and maximum value during hospitalization. The data are expressed as the median and IQR. An unpaired t test was used, and P &lt; 0.05 was considered significant.\nDuring hospitalization, 12 patients in the non-ACEI/ARB group (48%) were categorized into severe subgroups and one patient died. In contrast, in the ACEI/ARB group, only 4 patients (23.5%) were categorized into severe subgroups and no patients died (Figure 1(A)). The percentage of severe cases in the ACEI/ARB group was higher than that in the non-ACEI/ARB group, but this difference was not significant, possibly due to the small number of clinical cases. We next examined the effects of taking ACEI or ARB drugs on laboratory findings of COVID-19 patients with hypertension. As shown in Figure 1(B), there was a trend toward lower IL-6 levels in patients from the ACEI/ARB group. No marked variation in C-reactive protein (CRP) was observed between the two groups (Figure 1(B)). The absolute number of CD3+ and CD8+ T cells in the ACEI/ARB group was significantly higher than that in the non-ACEI/ARB group. There were no significant changes in CD4+ T cell counts between the two groups (Figure 1(C)). In addition, although the viral load was not different between the two groups at hospital admission, the peak viral load during hospitalization in the ACEI/ARB group was significantly lower than that in the non-ACEI/ARB group (Figure 1(D)). Other laboratory findings, such as white blood cell counts, neutrophil counts, platelet counts, and lactate dehydrogenase, are shown in supplementary Table S3, and no significant differences were observed between the two groups. \nDiscussion\nIt was reported that the RAS plays a critical role in regulating hypertension and acute lung injury caused by viruses, such as SARS and H7N9. Changes in RAS activity are related to the pathogenesis of hypertension and inflammatory lung disease. Targeting RAS is an effective antihypertension therapeutic strategy. ACEIs and ARB, which inhibit the ACE/Ang II/AT1R system, are commonly used drugs for hypertensive patients. Recent evidence suggests that hypertensive COVID-19 patients are predisposed to develop severe cases. Thus, it is important to determine the effect of RAS inhibitors on COVID-19 patients with hypertension.\nStudies have suggested that COVID-19 patients have increased Angiotensin II compared to healthy people. The abnormal increase in Angiotensin II was related to hypertension and lung failure. In addition, RAS inhibitors have been shown to be associated with reduced mortality in patients with sepsis. Angiotensin II positively regulates the expression of inflammatory cytokines through the activation of AT1R. Excessively high levels of inflammatory cytokines are harmful to the outcomes of COVID-19 patients. Thus, it was suggested that it is beneficial for COVID-19 patients to use ACEIs/ARBs to inhibit the RAS. However, until now, no confirmed clinical evidence has been available. In this study, COVID-19 patients with hypertension were enrolled, and we found that ACEI/ARB therapy attenuated the inflammatory response, potentially through the inhibition of IL-6 levels, which is consistent with the findings that ACEI and ARB therapy alleviated LPS-induced pneumonic injury. For patients with chronic heart failure, it has been proven that ACEI therapy was associated with decreased Th1/Th2 cytokine ratios and inflammatory cytokine production. This study also suggests that ACEI/ARB therapy had a beneficial effect on the immune system by avoiding peripheral T cell depletion. Furthermore, the viral load was reported to be highly correlated with severe lung injury. It was also observed that ACEI/ARB therapy decreased the viral load, but we hypothesize that RAS inhibitors do not directly inhibit viral replication; rather, they play an indirect antiviral role by regulating immune function and inhibiting inflammatory responses, and the mechanism needs to be clarified through in vitro and in vivostudies in the future.\nTaken together, this is the first clinical evidence demonstrating that RAS inhibitors improve the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients with hypertension, suggesting that these patients could benefit from the persistent or preferential usage of ACEI/ARB for antihypertensive treatment.\nSupplementary Material\nDisclosure statement\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).\nORCID\nGuoliang Zhang

virus-induced acute lung injury","abstract":"Since March 2013, the emergence of an avian-origin influenza A (H7N9) virus has raised concern in China.\n Although most infections resulted in respiratory illness, some severe cases resulted in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is a severe form of acute lung injury (ALI) that further contributes to morbidity.\n To date, no effective drugs that improve the clinical outcome of influenza A (H7N9) virus-infected patients have been identified.\n Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and ACE2 are involved in several pathologies such as cardiovascular functions, renal disease, and acute lung injury.\n In the current study, we report that ACE2 could mediate the severe acute lung injury induced by influenza A (H7N9) virus infection in an experimental mouse model.\n Moreover, ACE2 deficiency worsened the disease pathogenesis markedly, mainly by targeting the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1).\n The current findings demonstrate that ACE2 plays a critical role in influenza A (H7N9) virus-induced acute lung injury, and suggest that might be a useful potential therapeutic target for future influenza A (H7N9) outbreaks.\n","id":"PMC4229671","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing
