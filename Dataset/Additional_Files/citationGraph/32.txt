Fever clinics in general hospitals were requested to reinforce surveillance of this highly contagious disease. Patients with body temperatures &gt;=37.3 C were asked to firstly visit fever clinics, where a triage strategy was implemented, and probable or possible cases were identified by experts or expert panels, and samples were sent for quick viral detection. During this period, pneumonias caused by other etiologies such as influenza were also prevalent in Beijing, as in other regions of the country; it was a challenge for physicians to identify suspected COVID-19 from patients with fever, particularly from pneumonias of varied etiologies. Therefore, information was needed to help differentiate COVID-19 from pneumonias caused by other etiologies in this critical situation.\nWe conducted a retrospective, single-centered study and recruited patients visiting the fever clinic at Peking University Third Hospital from January 21 to February 15, 2020. Based on epidemiological history, clinical and radiological manifestations, cases with possible or probable COVID-19 were sent for panel discussion and then for SARS-CoV-2 detection by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Pediatric patients were not included in our study. This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Ethics Committee of Peking University Third Hospital (No. IRB00006761-M2020189), and the data were analyzed anonymously.\nThe diagnosis and severity assessment of COVID-19 were according to Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Infection by the National Health Commission. Laboratory testing of SARS-CoV-2 in throat swabs was performed by both Beijing Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Haidian District CDC of Beijing.\nDemographic and epidemiological data were collected. Epidemiological data included: if the patient came from Wuhan City or other cities of Hubei Province in 2 weeks, if the patient ever had close contact with individuals from Wuhan or other cities of Hubei province, or with individuals who had confirmed COVID-19 in 2 weeks, and if the onset of pneumonia occurred in family members in a short period. Clinical indices and symptoms on admission were also recorded. Data from laboratory examinations including blood routines, and computed tomography (CT) findings were collected. CT features were reviewed by experts of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine and Radiology.\nContinuous variables were expressed as the mean +- standard deviation or median (interquartile range). Categorical variables were expressed as numbers (%). Student's t test or Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare differences between groups for continuous variables and Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test was used to analyze categorical variables, respectively. Results were considered statistically significant at P &lt; 0.05. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software, version 22.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA).\nFrom January 21 to February 15, 2020, physicians at the Fever Clinic referred 156 cases to panel discussion by multi-discipline experts. After discussion, 110 were considered to be possible or probable cases of COVID-19, and received SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing, which was positive in 19 cases (COVID-19 group). For the remaining 91 cases with negative viral detection, 2 cases were not included in the final analysis because they had epidemiological evidence with interstitial pneumonia in CT findings and COVID-19 could not be completely excluded, 22 were excluded from the analysis because of lack of CT scan or no signs of pneumonia on CT scan, and finally 67 patients were included as the non-COVID-19 group [Supplementary Figure 1].\nThe demographics and baseline characteristics of the 19 patients with COVID-19 were shown in Supplementary Table 1. The median age was 44.0 (33.0 - 69.0) years. Men and women were equally affected. Seventeen patients (17/19, 89.5%) had a clear epidemiological history of COVID-19. Six patients had close contact with their family members who were infected by SARS-CoV-2. In the two patients with unclear epidemiological link, one was a social worker contacting a high flow of people and his wife was confirmed to have COVID-19 by positive SARS-CoV-2 test about one week later. The other one had no epidemiological history on admission, but another patient, who had had dinner with him, was also diagnosed to have COVID-19 later. An incubation period was elicited from 11 patients, ranging from 2 to 10 days with a median of 6.0 days. Most of the patients (17/19, 89.5%) were mild-moderate in disease severity. Two patients were classified as severe cases with pulse oxygen saturation (SpO2) &lt;=93% on presentation, while no critical cases were identified in our series.\nOn admission, most patients (17/19, 89.5%) had fever with a mean body temperature of 37.8oC. Cough (7/19, 36.8%), expectoration (6/19, 31.6%), fatigue (10/19, 52.6%), and headache or dizziness (7/19, 36.8%) were common symptoms. Other symptoms included shortness of breath, myalgia or arthralgia, sore throat, nasal symptoms and diarrhea. Compared with non-COVID-19 patients, a higher proportion of COVID-19 patients had an identified epidemiological history (89.5% vs. 32.8%, P &lt; 0.001). Clinical symptoms were similar between cases of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19, except for cough [Table 1].\nEpidemiological history, symptoms and blood routine test on admission between patients with COVID-19 and non-COVID-19.\nBlood routine showed decreased lymphocyte count in 42.1% (8/19) of the COVID-19 patients. More than 80% of COVID-19 patients had normal white blood cell (WBC) and neutrophil counts. Compared with COVID-19 patients, non-COVID-19 patients had higher total WBC ([7.21 +- 2.94] x 109/L vs. [5.30 +- 1.48] x 109/L, t = -3.861, P &lt; 0.001) and neutrophil counts (4.45 [3.24, 7.11] x 109/L vs. 3.10 [2.28, 4.51] x 109/L , Z = -2.758, P = 0.006). Additionally, more non-COVID-19 patients had increased WBC (20.9% vs. 0.0%, P = 0.047) and neutrophil counts (31.3% vs. 5.3%, P = 0.049). However, lymphocyte counts and the proportions of patients with decreased lymphocytes were not statistically different between the two groups [Table 1].\nIn non-COVID-19 patients, infiltrates on the CT scan mainly involved 1-2 lung lobes, while in COVID-19 patients, lesions involving 4-5 lobes were more common (COVID-19 vs. non-COVID-19: 50.0% vs. 16.4%, P = 0.009). In COVID-19 patients, lung lesions were mostly peripheral or sub-pleural in distribution (14/18, 77.8%), and in severe cases were diffusely distributed (4/18, 22.2%) [Supplementary Figure 2]. In non-COVID-19 patients, 34.3% (23/67) showed airway-dominant lesions, while diffuse distribution was found in only 4.5% (3/67) of the patients. The patterns of the lesions (ground-glass opacity [GGO], consolidation or mixed GGO and consolidation) showed no significant difference between the two groups (P = 0.165). However, centrilobular nodules were observed in non-COVID-19 patients but not in COVID-19 patients [Supplementary Table 2].\nIn this study, we found that epidemiological history was extremely important for identification of suspected cases of COVID-19 and for differential diagnosis. Over 90% of the COVID-19 patients had clearly identified epidemiological evidence, while in non-COVID-19 patients, epidemiological links could only be found in about 30%. In the early phase of our study, most cases were imported from the city of Wuhan or other cities in Hubei Province, including traveling to or living in Wuhan or other cities in Hubei province, and a few had a history of close contact with individuals coming from the above mentioned areas. In the later phase, contact with family members with confirmed COVID-19 was an epidemiological feature and five family clusters were found.\nOur study showed that the total WBC count and the neutrophil count were different between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. Leukocytosis and neutrophilia were more common in patients with non-COVID-19 pneumonia. In contrast, although decrease of lymphocytes was also common in our study, the difference between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 cases was not significant, probably due to the fact that pneumonias enrolled for this analysis were mostly viral (for example, influenza) or atypical, as classical bacterial pneumonia had been excluded by first screening/triage. Leukocytosis and neutrophilia may be helpful to exclude COVID-19, especially in those without clear epidemiological history. Persistent lymphopenia is a predictor of severe cases of COVID-19. A recent study demonstrated that serum albumin and C-reactive protein were also the risk factors for disease progression.\nUnlike pneumonia caused by other pathogens, COVID-19 has some unique characteristics on the CT scan. Firstly, multi-lobe involvement was more common in COVID-19 as compared with non-COVID-19 pneumonia. The lesions, including ground-glass opacity (GGO), mixed GGO and patchy consolidation, were mainly distributed in peripheral and sub-pleural areas in mild to moderate cases, while in severe cases diffuse ground glass lesions were present. These features were consistent with a previous study.\nIn conclusion, epidemiological evidence was important for prompt COVID-19 case finding, and lower blood WBC and neutrophil counts may be useful for differentiating it from pneumonia of other etiologies. Our findings here added to the knowledge of COVID-19 for clinical practice in fever clinics facing newly emerging respiratory infections. However, as a single-center study in the early period of the epidemic, our findings were limited by the small number of cases and the fact that the pathogens in non-COVID-19 pneumonias were not identified, which needed to be clarified in larger studies.\nConflicts of interest\nNone.\nSupplementary Material\nHow to cite this article: Liang Y, Liang JJ, Zhou QT, Li XG, Lin F, Deng ZH, Zhang BY, Li L, Wang XH, Zhu H, Ma QB, Tong XM, Xu J, Sun YC.

five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.\n\n Increasing quartile of NLR was statistically significantly associated with secondary outcome.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR is associated with outcomes in unselected critically ill patients.\n\n In patients with sepsis, there was no statistically significant relationship between NLR and mortality.\n\n Further investigation is required to increase understanding of the

recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like

According to research, none of the infected patients in Zhejiang province were ever exposed to the Huanan seafood market, the original source of the virus; all studied cases were infected by human to human transmission. The most common symptoms at onset of illness were fever in 48 (77%) patients, cough in 50 (81%), expectoration in 35 (56%), headache in 21 (34%), myalgia or fatigue in 32 (52%), diarrhoea in 3 (8%), and haemoptysis in 2 (3%). Only two patients (3%) developed shortness of breath on admission. The median time from exposure to onset of illness was 4 days (interquartile range 3-5 days), and from onset of symptoms to first hospital admission was 2 (1-4) days.\nConclusion\nAs of early February 2020, compared with patients initially infected with SARS-Cov-2 in Wuhan, the symptoms of patients in Zhejiang province are relatively mild.\nIntroduction\nIn December 2019 a group of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause were confirmed to be infected with a novel coronavirus, known as 2019-nCoV, in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, which had previously not been detected in humans or animals. Epidemiological evidence suggested that most of these patients had visited a local seafood market in Wuhan and that the gene sequence of the virus obtained from these patients was highly similar to that identified in bats. The virus was subsequently renamed SARS-Cov-2 as it is similar to the coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), a member of the subgenus Sarbecovirus (Beta-CoV lineage B), with which it shares more than 79% of its sequence, but it is more distant to the coronavirus responsible for Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), a member of the Merbecovirus subgenus (only 50% homology with SARS-Cov-2). All these viruses are categorised within the same genus of the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae within the family Coronaviridae.    Some researchers have found that SARS-Cov-2 has strong affinity to human respiratory receptors, suggesting a potential threat to global public health.\nInitially, the first confirmed cases were nearly all related to the Huanan seafood market (closed on 1 January 2020) and were concentrated in Wuhan. Coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) soon drew global attention because of the rapidly increasing numbers of new cases. The new type of coronavirus infection was believed to have been transmitted from animals, and by January 2020 it was suspected that the initially affected patients had been infected with the virus through human to human transmission. Since January 2020 the spread of covid-19 has escalated and the virus has extended rapidly to most parts of China as well as to other countries. As of 8 February 2020 a confirmed 37 589 people have been infected with SARS-Cov-2 globally, including 302 people across 24 other countries. These figures are updated daily and are expected to increase further.\nDespite the increasing number of confirmed cases, the clinical investigation of patients was insufficient. A previous study reported the clinical characteristics of the first 41 infected patients in the greater Wuhan area, contributing to an understanding of the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of those patients. A second study found a familial cluster of SARS-Cov-2, clearly suggesting human to human transmission in family homes and hospitals and showing that spread of the virus between cities is possible. In late January 2020 large numbers of people across China were returning to their home towns after visiting Wuhan for the Chinese lunar new year. This weeklong holiday accounts for the largest mass movement of people worldwide each year. Consequently, over time more patients are expected to emerge across China and perhaps the world. We found that the characteristics of patients outside of Wuhan differed from those initially reported in patients in Wuhan. \nWe describe the clinical characteristics and laboratory findings of patients in Zhejiang province infected with SARS-Cov-2 to provide an insight into the prevention and treatment of covid-19 across China and elsewhere.\nMethods\nData sources\nWe conducted a retrospective study focusing on the clinical characteristics of confirmed cases of covid-19 in Zhejiang province from 10 January 2020 to 26 January 2020. Since the outbreak of covid-19, strict precautionary measures have been implemented in Zhejiang province, including the creation of fever clinics that exclusively receive patients with suspected SARS-Cov-2 infection, defined as presenting with a fever or any respiratory symptoms, including dry cough, and especially in those with a history of travel to Wuhan or exposure to infected people within two weeks before the onset of illness since January 2020. Case definitions of confirmed human infection with SARS-Cov-2 are in accordance with the interim guidance from the World Health Organization. Only patients with a laboratory confirmed infection were enrolled in this study. We collected data on 62 patients admitted to hospital with laboratory confirmed SARS-Cov-2 infection in seven designated tertiary hospitals in Zhejiang province (see supplementary file for further details). Information was collected on dates of illness onset, visits to clinical facilities, and hospital admissions. Epidemiological data were collected through brief interviews with each patient. Several investigators interviewed each patient to collect exposure histories during the two weeks before illness onset, including the dates and times of close contact (gathering, living, or working together) with individuals from Wuhan with confirmed or suspected SARS-Cov-2 infection. The incubation period was defined as the time from exposure to the onset of illness, which was estimated among patients who could provide the exact date of close contact with individuals from Wuhan with confirmed or suspected SARS-Cov-2 infection. We also investigated the possibility of familial clusters:that is, index patients who travelled to Wuhan and then infected others in their families.\nWe extracted the medical records of patients and sent these to the data collection centre in Hangzhou. A team of doctors who had been treating patients with covid-19 collected and reviewed the data. Because of the urgent need to collect data on this emerging pathogen, the requirement for informed consent was waived. We used a standardised case report form to collect clinical data. If information was not clear, the working group in Hangzhou contacted the doctor responsible for the treatment of the patient for clarification.\nLaboratory confirmation and treatment\nSputum and throat swab specimens collected from all patients at admission were tested by real time polymerase chain reaction for SARS-Cov-2 RNA within three hours. Laboratory confirmation of the virus was performed using real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Virus detection was repeated twice every 24 hours.\nLaboratory tests were conducted at admission, including a complete blood count, serum biochemistry, and identification of other respiratory pathogens such as influenza A virus (H1N1, H3N2, H7N9), influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, and adenovirus. Most patients received antiviral treatment with interferon alpha inhalation (50 mug twice daily), lopinavir and ritonavir (400 mg twice daily and 100 mg twice daily, respectively), and arbidol (200 mg three times daily). Patients received treatment with corticosteroid (40-80 mg/day) and gamma globulin (15-20 g/day) for 3-5 days when their resting respiratory rate was more than 30 per minute, or oxygen saturation was below 93% without oxygen, or multiple pulmonary lobes showed more than 50% progression of disease in 48 hours on imaging. Patients also received treatment with probiotics in most cases. Quinolones and second generation beta lactams (oral and intravenous) were administered if fever lasted for more than seven days or C reactive protein levels were 30 mg/L or more (normal range 0-8 mg/L). Patients suspected of being infected with SARS-Cov-2 were discharged from hospital once the results of two real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction tests taken 24 hours apart were negative for SARS-Cov-2 antigens.\nStatistical analysis\nAs a previous study has shown that patients' condition worsens on the 10th day after illness onset, we divided the cohort into patients with symptoms for more than 10 days and those with symptoms for less than 10 days. We summarised continuous variables as either means and standard deviations or medians with interquartile ranges. For categorical variables, we calculated the percentages of patients in each category. All analyses were done with SPSS software, version 22.0.\nPatient and public involvement\nThis was a retrospective case series study and no patients were involved in the study design, setting the research questions, or the outcome measures directly. No patients were asked to advise on interpretation or writing up of results.\nResults\nEpidemiological characteristics\nBy 26 January 2020, clinical data were collected on 62 patients in Zhejiang province with laboratory confirmed SARS-Cov-2 infection. Twenty five (40%) of the patients were aged 19-40 years, 33 (53%) were aged 41-65 years, 2 (3%) were aged 10 and 11 years, and 2 (3%) were aged 65 years and older. The median age was 41 years (interquartile range 32-52 years; table 1). As of 26 January 2020, more than half of the 62 patients (35, 56%) were men. No patients had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market and all 62 patients had been exposed to individuals with confirmed SARS-Cov-2 infection. Among the 62 patients, 23 (37%) resided in Wuhan and the remaining 39 (63%) had made short term trips to Wuhan before illness onset. Fifty six (90%) patients could provide the exact date of close contact with someone with confirmed or suspected SARS-Cov-2 infection.\nPersonal and clinical characteristics of 62 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) in Zhejiang province, China.

The median age of patients was 45 years (interquartile range 37-54 years; table 1).\nClinical features\nTwenty of the 62 patients (32%) had underlying diseases:seven (11%) had liver disease, five (8%) had hypertension, and one (2%) each had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, renal disease, and cerebrovascular disease. Twenty one of the 62 patients (34%) were associated with familial clusters.\nOf the 33 patients with symptoms for more than 10 days after illness onset, 13 (39%) had underlying diseases: four (12%) patients had liver disease, four (12%) had hypertension, and one each had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (3%), diabetes (3%), and cerebrovascular disease (3%). Among 56 patients who could provide the exact date of close contact with someone with confirmed or suspected SARS-Cov-2 infection, the median incubation period from exposure to symptoms was 4 days (interquartile range 3-5 days). The median time from onset of symptoms to first hospital admission was 2.0 (1.0-4.3) days. The most common symptoms at illness onset were fever (48, 77%), cough (50, 81%), expectoration (35, 56%), headache (21, 34%), myalgia or fatigue (32, 52%), diarrhoea (3, 8%), and haemoptysis (2, 3%). Only two (3%) patients developed shortness of breath. Among the 33 patients who had symptoms for more than 10 days after illness onset, the median incubation period from exposure to symptoms was 3 days (interquartile range 3-4 days). The median time from onset of symptoms to first hospital admission was 6.5 (5.0-9.0) days. The most common symptoms at onset of illness were cough (27, 82%), fever (24, 73%), expectoration (19, 58%), myalgia or fatigue (19, 58%), headache (15, 45%), diarrhoea (3, 9%), and haemoptysis (2, 6%). Only one (3%) patient developed shortness of breath.\nOn admission, the blood counts of 19 of the 62 (31%) patients showed leucopenia (white blood cell count &lt;4x109/L) and 26 (42%) showed lymphopenia (lymphocyte count &lt;1.0x109/L; table 2). The D-dimer levels were within normal range (median 0.2 mg/L (interquartile range 0.2-0.5 mg/L). Levels of aspartate aminotransferase increased in 10 (16%) patients. Fifty five (89%) patients had normal serum levels of procalcitonin (&lt;0.1 ng/mL). Abnormalities on chest computed tomograms or radiographs were detected among all of the patients except for one. Fifty two (84%) patients showed bilateral involvement on chest radiographs (table 2). Typical chest computed tomography findings of infected patients on admission were bilateral or multiple lobular or subsegmental areas of consolidation or bilateral ground glass opacity (fig 1). Only one patient did not have pneumonia. Of the 62 patients, only one was transferred to an intensive care unit for acute respiratory distress syndrome and received mechanical ventilation (table 3). Fifty five (89%) patients received antiviral treatment, 28 (45%) were given empirical antibiotic treatment, and 16 (26%) were given systematic corticosteroid and gamma globulin treatment. At this point, one (2%) patient had been discharged and no patients had died. Fitness for discharge was based on abatement of fever for at least three days, with improved evidence on chest radiography and viral clearance in samples from the lower respiratory tract.\nLaboratory and chest radiography findings in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) on admission to hospital in Zhejiang province, China.

The number of infections is increasing rapidly. It is possible that an even greater number of infected patients exist without a diagnosis because their symptoms were less severe and because of the incubation period. Thousands of patients with suspected SARS-Cov-2 infection could eventually receive a diagnosis. The clinical features of early cases of covid-19 in Wuhan were not the same as those in other areas of China. According to our data, none of the infected patients in Zhejiang province had been exposed to the Huanan seafood market, and as the number of familial clusters in infected patients in our study is large, this might suggest human to human transmission. This finding is also consistent with a published article. Further detailed investigations should aim to ascertain the exact mode of transmission.\nMost of the infected individuals in Zhejiang province were male patients, but the age range of patients is large as SARS-Cov-2 also infected children and those older than 65 years.  No major differences were found between the initial clinical symptoms of patients in Zhejiang province and those in Wuhan. Most of the patients in Zhejiang province, however, had mild to moderate symptoms, and only a small portion of them had dyspnoea. Only one patient developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and was admitted to an intensive care unit. The laboratory test results showed that the patients also experienced mild illness. There were fewer patients with abnormal renal function and lactate dehydrogenase and procalcitonin levels. Through media and national advocacy, patients with fever, cough, expectoration, and other upper respiratory tract symptoms were asked to go to hospital at an early stage. Even those who had contact with other patients, or patients with suspected infection were asked to go to hospital. We also analysed patients with symptoms for more than 10 days after illness onset. We found that the clinical features of patients with symptoms for longer than 10 days in Zhejiang province were less severe than those of the primary infected patients from Wuhan.  This phenomenon was also apparent during the transmission of MERS-CoV. The global case mortality of MERS-CoV was about 40%, whereas the mortality from second generation MERS-CoV was about 20%.  \nPatients in the two cohorts received antiviral treatment, but the types of drugs used varied between patients. Treatment with lopinavir and ritonavir were reported to have the potential to treat SARS infections, and we suppose this treatment might be a beneficial part of the treatment for covid-19. The rate of antibiotic and corticosteroid use was different. Less than half the patients in Zhejiang province received antibiotics. Whether the use of antivirals, antibiotics, or steroids affects the prognosis of patients remains unknown.\nGiven that most infections in Zhejiang province were in patients who had no direct contact with the original site of outbreak, our findings provide valuable information in the understanding of the clinical features of covid-19, as the number of people with confirmed disease continues to increase rapidly. Our study population might represent most of the clinical characteristics of infected patients since January 2020. Further containment proposals should be implemented by the Chinese government, such as preventing people from Wuhan having contact with those elsewhere, banning gatherings of more than 100 people, conducting daily public-wide educational campaigns on precautionary measures against exposure to SARS-Cov-2, encouraging people to cancel traditional family gatherings such as during the Chinese lunar new year, and extending the Chinese lunar new year holiday to prevent large scale spread.\nLimitations of this study\nOur study has several limitations. Firstly, only 62 patients were included. A large number of patients were continually being admitted to hospital as data were being collected, and thus we obtained data on most but not all of the patients with laboratory confirmed infection in Zhejiang province during the study period. Secondly, as the patients were only from Zhejiang province, it might be that more clinical features related to covid-19 will be identified. Thirdly, at the time of study submission, most patients had not been discharged, so we are unable to estimate either the case fatality rate or the predictors of fatality. Moreover, the time since illness onset in some of our patients might be shorter than the observation period of 10 days, which could result in biases of clinical observation characteristics.\nConclusion\nCompared with the symptoms of the initial patients with SARS-Cov-2 infection in Wuhan, those of patients from Zhejiang province in our study were relatively mild. Currently, no effective drug treatment or vaccine exists. It is necessary for monitoring of the virus to be strengthened and drugs and vaccines to be developed against SARS-Cov-2 infection as soon as possible.\nWhat is already known on this topic\nAs of 8 February 2020, coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) caused by the 2019 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) has been responsible for more than 30 000 infections and 700 deaths globally, and the numbers are still increasing rapidly\nThe reported mortality from infection with SARS-Cov-2 in Wuhan, China reached 11-15%, which was inconsistent with what was observed outside of Hubei province\nThe epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients outside of Wuhan have not been described, especially in Zhejiang province, where by 8 February 2020 more than 1000 people were diagnosed as having covid-19\nWhat this study adds\nIn patients infected with SARS-Cov-2 in Zhejiang province, the median time from exposure to onset of illness was 4 days (interquartile range 3-5 days) and from onset of symptoms to first hospital admission was 2 (1-4) days\nThe most common symptoms were fever, cough, expectoration, headache, myalgia or fatigue, diarrhoea, and haemoptysis, and only two patients developed shortness of breath on admission\nAt present, compared with the initial patients infected in Wuhan, the symptoms of patients in Zhejiang province are relatively mild\nExtra material supplied by authors\nContributors: X-WX and X-XW contributed equally to this article.

binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development

familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China,

Importantly, strains with high genetic similarity to SARS-CoV in the hypervariable N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 gene, the ORF3 and ORF8 region, respectively, were all discovered in this cave.\n In addition, we report the first discovery of bat SARSr-CoVs highly similar to human SARS-CoV in ORF3b and in the split ORF8a and 8b.\n Moreover, SARSr-CoV strains from this cave were more closely related to SARS-CoV in the non-structural protein genes ORF1a and 1b compared with those detected elsewhere.\n Recombination analysis shows evidence of frequent recombination events within the S gene and around the ORF8 between these SARSr-CoVs.\n We hypothesize that the direct progenitor of SARS-CoV may have originated after sequential recombination events between the precursors of these SARSr-CoVs.\n Cell entry studies demonstrated that three newly identified SARSr-CoVs with different S protein sequences are all able to use human ACE2 as the receptor, further exhibiting the close relationship between strains in this cave and SARS-CoV.\n This work provides new insights into the origin and evolution of SARS-CoV and highlights the necessity of preparedness for future emergence of SARS-like diseases.\n","id":"PMC5708621","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Ben","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei-Ping","surname":"Zeng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xing-Lou","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xing-Yi","surname":"Ge","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bei","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jia-Zheng","surname":"Xie","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xu-Rui","surname":"Shen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yun-Zhi","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ning","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dong-Sheng","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiao-Shuang","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mei-Niang","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Peter","surname":"Daszak","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin-Fa","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin-Fa","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jie","surname":"Cui","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng-Li","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng-Li","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christian","surname":"Drosten","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christian","surname":"Drosten","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christian","surname":"Drosten","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1128/JVI.06882-11","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Evidence for a common evolutionary origin of coronavirus spike protein receptor-binding subunits","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1126/science.1116480","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Structure of SARS coronavirus spike receptor-binding domain complexed with receptor","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00255","date":"1970-01-01","title":"ff14SB: improving the accuracy of protein side chain and backbone parameters from ff99SB","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1038/nature12005","date":"2013-02-13","title":"Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 is a functional receptor for the emerging human coronavirus-EMC","abstract":"Supplementary information\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1038/nature12005) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7095326","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing Group UK","authors":[{"firstname":"V.

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship

travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data.\n\n Outcomes were followed up until Jan 25, 2020.\nFindings\nOf the 99 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, 49 (49%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market.\n\n The average age of the patients was 55·5 years (SD 13·1), including 67 men and 32 women.\n\n 2019-nCoV was detected in all patients by real-time RT-PCR.\n\n 50 (51%) patients had chronic diseases.\n\n Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (82 [83%] patients),

rhinorrhoea (four [4%] patients), chest pain (two [2%] patients), diarrhoea (two [2%] patients), and nausea and vomiting (one [1%] patient).\n\n According to imaging examination, 74 (75%) patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 14 (14%) patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity, and one (1%) patient had pneumothorax.\n\n 17 (17%) patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and, among them, 11 (11%) patients worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection was of clustering onset, is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n In general, characteristics of patients who died

the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41

secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with

Mortality among these critically ill patients was high. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health.)\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the novel coronavirus first detected in Wuhan, China, that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). Since initial detection of the virus, more than 400,000 cases of Covid-19 have been confirmed worldwide, with the first reported cases in the United States occurring on January 19, 2020, in the state of Washington. The number of cases in Washington continues to rise; as of March 27, 2020, there had been 3700 confirmed Covid-19 cases and 175 deaths. Most of the cases have been in King County, an urban county that includes Seattle and outlying suburbs and accounts for 1760 Covid-19 cases and 125 deaths. Genomic and epidemiologic analyses of sequenced virus RNA recovered in the western Washington region have shown that the spread of SARS-CoV-2 has been the result of local community transmission : meaning that the source of infection cannot be traced back to a known exposure. Person-to-person transmission has also been well documented in skilled nursing and long-term care facilities in the Seattle metropolitan area.\nInitial reports from China and Italy suggest high mortality and stressed intensive care unit (ICU) capacity. Reports describing patients admitted to the ICU with Covid-19 in the United States are limited. A better characterization of Covid-19 infection in critically ill patients is important to guide decision making regarding critical care capacity and allocation of resources. The aim of our multicenter report is to describe the demographic characteristics, coexisting conditions, imaging findings, and outcomes among critically ill patients with Covid-19 in the Seattle metropolitan area.\nMethods\nStudy Population, Setting, and Data Collection\nWe included patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 infection who were admitted to nine hospital ICUs in the Seattle region between February 24 and March 9, 2020. A confirmed case of Covid-19 was defined by a positive result on a reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay of a specimen collected on a nasopharyngeal swab. Only laboratory-confirmed cases were included.\nTwenty-four adults (18 years of age or older) were identified from nine hospitals, including three University of Washington (UW) Medicine Hospitals (Harborview Medical Center, UW Medical Center-Montlake, and Northwest campuses), the Virginia Mason Medical Center, and the Swedish Hospitals (First Hill and Cherry Hill). This group represents six of the eight adult acute care hospitals in the city of Seattle; hospitals connected to these systems in suburbs outside Seattle (UW-Valley Medical Center, Swedish-Issaquah, and Swedish-Edmonds) were also included in the group of nine. Pregnant women, prisoners, and children (those younger than 18 years of age) were excluded from the study. The UW institutional review board approved this study with the reliance agreement (also known as an authorization agreement) of other local medical centers. The institutional review board at Swedish Medical Center also independently approved the study. Informed consent was waived, and researchers analyzed only deidentified (anonymized) data.\nData from each institution's electronic medical record was obtained through a research form in Research Electronic Data Capture software (REDCap, Vanderbilt University). We obtained demographic data, information on clinical symptoms or signs at presentation, and laboratory and radiologic results during ICU admission. All laboratory tests and radiologic assessments, including plain chest radiography and computed tomography of the chest, were performed at the discretion of the treating physician.\nStudy Definitions\nCoexisting conditions were ascertained from physician documentation. Patient data were censored at the time of data cutoff, which occurred on March 23, 2020. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was defined as acute-onset hypoxemia (the ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen [Pao2:Fio2], &lt;300) with bilateral pulmonary opacities on chest imaging that were not fully explained by congestive heart failure or other forms of volume overload.\nSpecimen Collection and Testing\nClinical specimens for Covid-19 diagnostic testing were obtained in accordance with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines. Initially, all clinical specimens were tested with the assay developed by the CDC, targeting the N1 and N2 genes, which was run at the Washington Department of Health State Public Health Laboratory. On March 2, UW began using an assay developed by the UW School of Medicine clinical virology laboratory (see the Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). The assay is based on the World Health Organization standard, and it targets the SARS-CoV-2 E gene and RdRp gene. If both targets are detected, the assay is reported as positive; if one target is detected, the assay is reported as inconclusive and is later confirmed reflexively by the real-time RT-PCR assay developed by the CDC at the Washington State Public Health Laboratory.\nStatistical Analysis\nDescriptive statistics were used to summarize the data; results are reported as medians and interquartile ranges or means and standard deviations, as appropriate. Categorical variables were summarized as counts and percentages. No imputation was made for missing data. Analysis was performed with Stata 15.1 software (StataCorp).\nResults\nDemographic and Clinical Characteristics of the Patients\nDuring the period from February 24 through March 9, we identified 24 critically ill patients with confirmed Covid-19 infection at the nine hospitals surveyed. This number included all patients admitted to the ICU under the care of an intensivist at any time during the hospital stay. The demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients are shown in Table 1. The mean (+-SD) age of the patients was 64+-18 years (range, 23 to 97); 63% were men. The mean duration of symptoms before hospital admission was 7+-4 days. None of the patients had recently traveled to a country with known transmission, such as China, South Korea, Iran, or Italy. A slight majority of patients (13 [54%]) had had recent contact with a person known to have been ill, but whether the sick contacts were infected with SARS-CoV-2 was not known because of the limited availability of testing at the time. Sixteen patients (67%) were admitted from home, and 6 patients (25%) were admitted from a skilled nursing facility. The most common symptoms on admission to the hospital were shortness of breath and cough, each of which occurred in 21 patients (88%). Documented fever was present in 12 patients (50%) on presentation at the hospital. Patient-level data are available in the Supplementary Appendix.\nChronic medical conditions were common in this critically ill population. Fourteen patients (58%) had diabetes mellitus and 5 (21%) had chronic kidney disease; 3 patients (14%) had asthma, and all 3 had recently received, as an outpatient, systemic glucocorticoids for a presumed asthma exacerbation before becoming critically ill. Five patients (22%) were current or former smokers and 1 patient (4%) had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; 8 patients (33%) had more than one coexisting condition.\nLaboratory and Radiologic Findings\nTable 2 shows the laboratory and radiologic findings in the patients on admission and during the ICU course. On admission, lymphocytopenia was common (in 75% of the patients), with a median lymphocyte count of 720 per cubic millimeter (interquartile range, 520 to 1375). Arterial lactate was 1.5 mg per deciliter or higher in 8 patients, and hepatic enzymes were 40 U per liter or higher in 9 patients. Troponin concentrations were elevated in 2 patients early in their ICU course (maximum value, 0.80 ng per deciliter).\nA chest radiograph was obtained in 23 patients (96%) on ICU admission, and all the radiographs showed bilateral pulmonary opacities. No pleural effusions were seen. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the chest was obtained in 5 patients (21%); four of the scans showed bilateral ground glass opacities, and one showed pulmonary nodules. Figure 1 provides representative images from a single patient, illustrating the rapid evolution of pulmonary opacities and the diffuse findings. A video showing the CT cross-sectional images of the chest is available at NEJM.org.\nMicrobiologic Results\nThe performance of the local UW assay was similar to that of the CDC assay in comparison diagnostic testing. All patients had Covid-19 confirmed by an RT-PCR assay of a nasal swab. The UW assay returned one inconclusive result that was later confirmed as positive by the Washington State Public Health Laboratory.\nOf the patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19, nearly all (23 patients [96%]) also had nasopharyngeal swabs sent to test for influenza and respiratory syncytial virus, and 21 patients (88%) had an extended-spectrum respiratory viral panel. None of the patients had a coinfection with another virus (see Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). Sputum samples from 15 patients were sent for bacterial culture, and all were negative for bacterial growth; blood samples from 20 patients were sent, and all remained negative. Bronchoscopy was performed in 4 patients. Two patients had bronchoscopy performed before diagnosis of Covid-19; bacterial and viral RT-PCR results were negative for other respiratory viruses. Two subjects had bronchoscopy performed late in the hospitalization for mucous plugging, without additional cultures.\nRespiratory Failure and Shock\nEighteen patients (75%) received invasive mechanical ventilation (Table 3). For patients who received mechanical ventilation, the Pao2:Fio2 ratios were consistent with moderate-to-severe ARDS. Pulmonary secretions were characterized as either moderate or thick and purulent in 14 patients (77%) during the first 7 days of mechanical ventilation. The median Fio2 on day 1 of mechanical ventilation was 0.9 (interquartile range, 0.7 to 1.0), and the Fio2 improved on day 3 to 0.6 (interquartile range, 0.5 to 0.7). The median driving pressure (the difference between plateau pressure and positive end expiratory pressure [PEEP]) on day 1 of mechanical ventilation was 13 cm of water (interquartile range, 11 to 17). During the first 3 days of mechanical ventilation, the median driving pressure was 12 to 13 cm of water. The median pulmonary compliance on day 1 was 29 ml per cm of water (interquartile range, 25 to 36). The pulmonary compliance improved during the first 3 days of mechanical ventilation, with median compliance on day 3 of 37 ml per cm of water (interquartile range, 25 to 42). Five patients (28%) were placed in a prone position, 7 (39%) received neuromuscular blockade, and 5 (28%) received inhaled pulmonary vasodilators to treat hypoxemic respiratory failure in ARDS. Tracheostomy was not completed in any of the patients.\nSeventeen patients (71%) presented with concurrent hypotension requiring vasopressors, without clear evidence of secondary infection. Of these patients, 3 (18%) had transient hypotension after intubation; 14 (82%) had hypotension that was unrelated to intubation or that persisted for more than 12 hours after intubation. None of the echocardiograms completed in 9 patients (38%) showed new cardiac dysfunction. Seven patients received compassionate-use remdesivir as antiviral therapy, 1 patient received hydroxychloroquine, and 1 patient received lopinavir-ritonavir; no patient received systemic glucocorticoids or tocilizumab in the ICU.\nOutcomes\nAll patients had at least 14 days of hospital follow-up. As of March 23, of the 24 patients, 12 (50%) had died, 4 (17%) had been discharged from the ICU but remained in the hospital, 3 (13%) were receiving mechanical ventilation and were still in the ICU, and 5 (21%) had been discharged from the hospital (Figure 2). A greater percentage of patients over 65 years of age had died than patients under 65 years of age (62% vs. 37%). The 12 deaths included 4 patients (17%) who had do-not-resuscitate orders in place before hospital admission for use in the event of cardiac arrest, and 6 additional patients (25%) had do-not-resuscitate orders that were instituted during their admission.\nThe median length of hospital stay among survivors was 17 days (interquartile range, 16 to 23), and the median length of ICU stay among survivors was 14 days (interquartile range, 4 to 17) (Table 3). The median duration of mechanical ventilation was 10 days (interquartile range, 7 to 12), and 6 patients (33%) had been extubated as of March 23, 2020. Three patients continued to receive ventilatory support, so the durations of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay are likely to be underestimates.\nDiscussion\nThis multicenter case series describes 24 critically ill patients who presented with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 infection. We included all patients with Covid-19 who were admitted to an ICU at nine Seattle-area hospitals between February 24 and March 9, 2020. All the patients had acquired Covid-19 without known exposure to a returning traveler. Coexisting lower respiratory bacterial infections were not identified in sputum and blood cultures obtained early in the clinical course. Overall outcomes were poor in patients who received ICU care.\nThe patients in our series presented with respiratory symptoms similar to those of patients described in reports from China, which indicates a common host response to SARS-CoV-2. Cough was the most common presenting symptom, as it was in reports from China, and the mean duration of symptoms before ICU admission was 1 week. Only half the patients had fever at the time of hospital admission, which suggests that fever may not be a useful criterion to determine the severity of illness and that diagnostic algorithms that require fever for Covid-19 testing may delay diagnosis. The majority of patients had chronic illnesses before their admission to the ICU, most commonly diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease. Lymphocytopenia was common on hospital admission, as it was in reports from China.\nThe case fatality rate of 50% in this series (to date) is similar to that reported among critically ill patients in Chinese hospitals but lower than that in a single-center experience reported from our area. Although the case fatality rate was higher in persons 65 years of age or older, it was still substantial (37%) in persons younger than 65 years of age. Our case fatality rate may be an underestimate, given that 3 patients remained intubated at the time data were censored.\nPatients who received mechanical ventilation had high oxygen requirements soon after initiation of mechanical ventilation, with plateau pressures (mean, 25 cm of water) and driving pressures (mean, 12 to 13 cm of water) similar to those in populations of patients with ARDS enrolled in clinical trials. For example, the mean plateau pressure in the Reevaluation of Systemic Early Neuromuscular Blockade (ROSE) trial was 25 to 26 cm of water. Of the 18 patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation in this series, 6 had been successfully extubated. The earliest extubation occurred 8 days after initiation of invasive mechanical ventilation, which suggests that acute respiratory failure due to Covid-19 may require prolonged mechanical ventilation lasting days to weeks and that readiness for extubation is unlikely to occur early in patients receiving mechanical ventilation. Of patients who were extubated, the age range was 23 to 88 years, which suggests that age may not be the sole indicator for successful extubation.\nA large proportion of patients in this series presented with shock that required vasopressor support. In patients who had an echocardiogram, myocardial dysfunction was uncommon. The lack of bacterial or viral coinfection suggests that the observed shock was directly related to Covid-19. In these preliminary data, Covid-19 infection appears to differ from seasonal influenza, which is commonly associated with bacterial coinfection due to pathogens that colonize the nasopharynx, such as staphylococcus and streptococcus. Regarding antiviral interventions, 7 patients received compassionate-use remdesivir, but we have insufficient information to report associated outcomes. Bronchoscopy was performed in a minority of patients and did not appear to change clinical management.\nThree patients with mild asthma had received systemic glucocorticoids within 1 week before ICU admission, as outpatients, for presumed asthma exacerbation while they had symptoms of Covid-19. These 3 patients then presented to the hospital again, with severe respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. Previous studies have shown that glucocorticoid treatment for phylogenetically similar viruses, SARS-CoV (2003) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), was associated with a higher subsequent plasma viral load, longer duration of viremia, and worse clinical outcomes. These findings are in contrast to those of a recent nonrandomized observational study that suggested that glucocorticoids may be associated with improved clinical outcomes in patients with Covid-19 and ARDS. Further research is necessary to determine the role of systemic glucocorticoids in patients with Covid-19 infection.\nOur study has several notable limitations. First, some cases had incomplete documentation of clinical symptoms, missing laboratory testing, or both. However, given the need to provide objective data and the urgent timeline, we did not approach patients to obtain additional history or biologic samples for laboratory measurement. Second, 7 patients (29%) remained in hospitals at the time of data censoring on March 23, 2020; as a result, outcomes for those patients were not known. Third, because of our focus on the critical care needs of patients with the greatest severity of illness, our sample size is small. Finally, it is possible that critically ill patients with established goals of care that were not consistent with admission to an ICU were not included in this report. Specifically, this includes patients who received care on the general medical ward that focused on comfort measures only.\nThis early experience of the Covid-19 pandemic in the United States resembles the experience in other countries, with high mortality for patients requiring care in the ICU. Patients with coexisting conditions and older age are at risk for severe disease and poor outcomes after ICU admission. Better information is needed to inform care for these challenging patients. Our findings also highlight the importance of planning for mass critical care as the need for ICU care and ventilatory support to treat patients with Covid-19 grows rapidly in the United States.\nSupported by a grant from the National Institutes of Health (K23DK116967, to Dr. Bhatraju).\nDisclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.\nThis article was published on March 30, 2020, at NEJM.org.\nA data sharing statement provided by the authors is available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.\nSupplementary Appendix\nDisclosure Forms\nData Sharing Statement\nReferences\nNovel coronavirus : China\nCoronavirus COVID-19 global cases\nFirst case of 2019 novel coronavirus in the United States.\n2019 Novel coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19)\nCryptic transmission of novel coronavirus revealed by genomic epidemiology\nClinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study.\nCritical care utilization for the COVID-19 outbreak in Lombardy, Italy: early experience and forecast during an emergency response.\nCharacteristics and outcomes of 21 critically ill patients with COVID-19 in Washington State.\nPriorities for the US health community responding to COVID-19.\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome: the Berlin Definition.\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)\nDetection of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by real-time RT-PCR.\nClinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 in China.\nEarly neuromuscular blockade in the acute respiratory distress syndrome.\nProne positioning in severe acute respiratory distress syndrome.\nBacterial coinfection in influenza: a grand rounds review.\nClinical progression and viral load in a community outbreak of coronavirus-associated SARS pneumonia: a prospective study.\nEffects of early corticosteroid treatment on plasma SARS-associated coronavirus RNA concentrations in adult patients.\nCorticosteroid therapy for critically ill patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome.\nCorticosteroids as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of influenza: an updated Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis.\nRisk factors associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome and death in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia in Wuhan, China.\nCare of the critically ill and injured during pandemics and disasters: groundbreaking results from the Task Force on Mass Critical Care.\nIntroduction and executive summary: care of the critically ill and injured during pandemics and disasters: CHEST consensus statement.\nChest Radiographs and CT Images of a 55-Year-Old Patient with SARS-CoV-2.\nAn initial radiograph (anteroposterior view) of the chest at admission (Panel A) shows hazy opacities in the upper and mid lung zones.

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

concern.\n Herein, we investigated the extent of molecular divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and other related coronaviruses.\n Although we found only 4% variability in genomic nucleotides between SARS-CoV-2 and a bat SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV; RaTG13), the difference at neutral sites was 17%, suggesting the divergence between the two viruses is much larger than previously estimated.\n Our results suggest that the development of new variations in functional sites in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike seen in SARS-CoV-2 and viruses from pangolin SARSr-CoVs are likely caused by natural selection besides recombination.\n Population genetic analyses of 103 SARS-CoV-2 genomes indicated that these viruses had two major lineages (designated L and S), that are well defined by two different SNPs that show nearly complete linkage across the viral strains sequenced to date.\n We found that L lineage was more prevalent than the S lineage within the limited

We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical

Ultrasound May Support Diagnosis and Monitoring of COVID-19 Pneumonia","abstract":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19) is characterized by severe pneumonia and/or acute respiratory distress syndrome in about 20% of infected patients.\n Computed tomography (CT) is the routine imaging technique for diagnosis and monitoring of COVID-19 pneumonia.\n Chest CT has high sensitivity for diagnosis of COVID-19, but is not universally available, requires an infected or unstable patient to be moved to the radiology unit with potential exposure of several people, necessitates proper sanification of the CT room after use and is underutilized in children and pregnant women because of concerns over radiation exposure.\n The increasing frequency of confirmed COVID-19 cases is striking, and new sensitive diagnostic tools are needed to guide clinical practice.\n Lung ultrasound (LUS) is an emerging non-invasive bedside technique that is used to diagnose interstitial lung syndrome through evaluation and quantitation of the number of B-lines, pleural irregularities and nodules or consolidations.\n In patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, LUS reveals a typical pattern of diffuse interstitial lung syndrome, characterized by multiple or confluent bilateral B-lines with spared areas, thickening of the pleural line with pleural line irregularity and peripheral consolidations.\n LUS has been found to be a promising tool for the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia, and LUS findings correlate fairly with those of chest CT scan.\n Compared with CT, LUS has several other advantages, such as lack of exposure to radiation, bedside repeatability during follow-up, low cost and easier application in low-resource settings.\n Consequently, LUS may decrease utilization of conventional diagnostic imaging resources (CT scan and chest X-ray).\n LUS may help in early diagnosis, therapeutic decisions and follow-up monitoring of COVID-19 pneumonia, particularly in the critical care setting and in pregnant women, children and patients in areas with high rates of community transmission.\n","id":"PMC7369598","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine &amp;

non-specific.\n\n\nPurpose\nTo assess the performance of United States (U.\n\nS.\n\n) and Chinese radiologists in differentiating COVID-19 from viral pneumonia on chest CT.\n\n\nMethods\nA total of 219 patients with both positive COVID-19 by RT-PCR and abnormal chest CT findings were retrospectively identified from 7 Chinese hospitals in Hunan Providence, China from January 6 to February 20, 2020. A total of 205 patients with positive Respiratory Pathogen Panel for viral pneumonia and CT findings consistent with or highly suspicious for pneumonia by original radiology interpretation within 7 days of each other were identified from Rhode Island Hospital in Providence, RI.\n\n Three Chinese radiologists blindly reviewed all chest CTs (n=424) to differentiate COVID-19 from viral pneumonia.\n\n A sample of 58 age-matched cases was randomly selected and evaluated by 4 U.\n\nS.\n\n radiologists in a similar fashion.\n\n Different CT features were recorded and compared between the two groups.\n\n\nResults\nFor all chest CTs, three Chinese radiologists correctly differentiated COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 pneumonia 83% (350/424), 80% (338/424), and 60% (255/424) of the time, respectively.\n\n The seven radiologists had sensitivities of 80%, 67%, 97%, 93%, 83%, 73% and 70% and specificities of 100%, 93%, 7%, 100%, 93%, 93%, 100%.\n\n Compared to non-COVID-19 pneumonia, COVID-19 pneumonia was more likely to have a peripheral distribution (80% vs.\n\n 57%, p&lt;0.001), ground-glass opacity (91% vs.\n\n 68%, p&lt;0.001), fine reticular opacity (56% vs.\n\n 22%, p&lt;0.001), and vascular thickening (59% vs.\n\n 22%, p&lt;0.001), but less likely to have a central+peripheral distribution (14.% vs.\n\n 35%, p&lt;0.001), pleural effusion (4.1 vs.\n\n 39%, p&lt;0.001) and lymphadenopathy (2.7% vs.\n\n 10.2%, p&lt;0.001).\n\n\nConclusion\nRadiologists in China and the United States distinguished COVID-19 from viral pneumonia on chest CT with high specificity but moderate sensitivity.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7233414","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Radiological Society of North America","authors":[{"firstname":"Harrison

virus detection.\n\n\nMethods\nWe compared seven published real-time RT–PCR assays and two new assays that we have developed.\n\n To determine the analytical sensitivity of each assay, we constructed a synthetic universal control ribonucleic acid (uncRNA) containing all of the assays’ target regions on one RNA strand and spiked human blood or urine with known quantities of African or Asian Zika virus strains.\n\n Viral loads in 33 samples from Zika virus-infected patients were determined by using one of the new assays.\n\n\nFindings\nOligonucleotides of the published real-time RT–PCR assays, showed up to 10 potential mismatches with the Asian lineage causing the current outbreak, compared with 0 to 4 mismatches for the new assays.\n\n The 95% lower detection limit of the seven most sensitive assays ranged from 2.1 to 12.1 uncRNA copies/reaction.\n\n Two assays had lower sensitivities of 17.0 and 1373.3 uncRNA copies/reaction and showed a similar sensitivity when using spiked samples.\n\n The mean viral loads in samples from Zika virus-infected patients were 5?×?104 RNA copies/mL of blood and 2?×?104 RNA copies/mL of urine.\n\n\nConclusion\nWe provide reagents and updated protocols for Zika virus detection suitable for the current outbreak strains.\n\n Some published assays might be unsuitable for Zika virus detection, due to the limited sensitivity and potential incompatibility with some strains.\n\n Viral concentrations in the clinical samples were close to the technical detection limit, suggesting that the use of insensitive assays will cause false-negative results.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5153932","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"World Health Organization","authors":[{"firstname":"Victor

severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) during its emergence in humans.\n In spite of intense study, it remains unclear whether the deletion actually reflects adaptation to humans.\n Here we engineered full, partially deleted (?29?nt), and fully deleted ORF8 into a SARS-CoV infectious cDNA clone, strain Frankfurt-1. Replication of the resulting viruses was compared in primate cell cultures as well as Rhinolophus bat cells made permissive for SARS-CoV replication by lentiviral transduction of the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor.\n Cells from cotton rat, goat, and sheep provided control scenarios that represent host systems in which SARS-CoV is neither endemic nor epidemic.\n Independent of the cell system, the truncation of ORF8 (29?nt deletion) decreased replication up to 23-fold.\n The effect was independent of the type I interferon response.\n The 29?nt deletion in SARS-CoV is a deleterious mutation acquired along the initial human-to-human transmission chain.\n The resulting loss of fitness may be due to a founder effect, which has rarely been documented in processes of viral emergence.\n These results have important implications for the retrospective assessment of the threat posed by SARS.\n","id":"PMC6181990","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing Group

infections in adults and children.\n While their clinical representation resembles that of many other agents of the common cold, their evolutionary histories, and host associations could provide important insights into the natural history of past human pandemics.\n For two of these viruses, we have strong evidence suggesting an origin in major livestock species while primordial associations for all four viruses may have existed with bats and rodents.\n HCoV-NL63 and -229E may originate from bat reservoirs as assumed for many other coronaviruses, but HCoV-OC43 and -HKU1 seem more likely to have speciated from rodent-associated viruses.\n HCoV-OC43 is thought to have emerged from ancestors in domestic animals such as cattle or swine.\n The bovine coronavirus has been suggested to be a possible ancestor, from which HCoV-OC43 may have emerged in the context of a pandemic recorded historically at the end of the 19th century.\n New data suggest that HCoV-229E may actually be

The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the

The primary objective was to analyse the bilirubin at inclusion according to the 90-day mortality rate.\n\n\nResults\nThe 90-day mortality rate was 33.8% (n = 272).\n\n The non-survivors were older, had higher Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and were more likely to have a medical diagnosis on admission than the survivors.\n\n At inclusion, the SOFA score without the liver score (10.3±2.9 vs.\n\n 9.0±3.0, p&lt;0.0001) and the serum bilirubin levels (36.1±57.0 vs.\n\n 20.5±31.5 ?mol/L, p&lt;0.0001) were significantly higher in the non-survivors than in the survivors.\n\n Age, the hepatic SOFA score, the coagulation SOFA score, the arterial pH level, and the plateau pressure were independently associated with 90-day mortality in patients with ARDS.\n\n\nConclusion\nBilirubin used as a surrogate marker of hepatic dysfunction and measured early in the course of ARDS was associated with the 90-day mortality rate.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4670098","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Stéphanie","surname":"Dizier","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jean-Marie","surname":"Forel","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Louis","surname":"Ayzac","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jean-Christophe","surname":"Richard","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sami","surname":"Hraiech","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Samuel","surname":"Lehingue","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Anderson","surname":"Loundou","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Antoine","surname":"Roch","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Claude","surname":"Guerin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Laurent","surname":"Papazian","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"A.B.

in a manner that summarizes the “net effect” of an intervention on these two outcomes.\n However, this combining of outcome measures makes VFDs difficult to understand and analyze, which contributes to imprecise interpretations.\n We discuss the strengths and limitations of VFDs and other “failure-free day” composites, and we provide a framework for when and how to use these outcome measures.\n We also provide a comprehensive discussion of the different analytic methods for analyzing and interpreting VFDs, including Student’s t tests and rank-sum tests, as well as competing risk regressions treating extubation as the primary outcome and death as the competing risk.\n Using simulations, we illustrate how the statistical test with optimal power depends on the relative contributions of mortality and ventilator duration on the composite effect size.\n Finally, we recommend a simple analysis and reporting framework using the competing risk approach, which provides clear information on the effect size of an intervention, a statistical test and measure of confidence with the ability to adjust for baseline factors and allow interim monitoring for trials.\n We emphasize that any

PRISM score prior to NB-BAL, observations at the time of NB-BAL and arterial blood gases, oxygenation index (OI), ventilator settings, haemodynamic variables and temperature taken at 1 h before, and 1 and 6 h after NB-BAL, were retrieved from the archived computerised database.\n Results: Median age was 7 months (IQR 2.8–43 months) and median weight was 5.5 kg (IQR 4–14 kg).\n Four (7%) patients exhibited significant immediate complications, requiring escalation of respiratory or haemodynamic support.\n Forty-two (70%) patients had complete data for calculation of OI; there was no significant change in median OI at 1 and 6 h after NB-BAL.\n However 5 (12%) of these patients experienced an increase in OI of between 10 and 45 at 1 h post NB-BAL, which returned to baseline at 6 h post NB-BAL.\n Complications did not correlate with any of the available variables: baseline OI, PRISM score or with deterioration at the time of the procedure, although it was observed that four out of the six patients with baseline OIs of greater than 20 experienced complications.\n Conclusion: Non-bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage in critically ill mechanically ventilated neonates and children is generally a well-tolerated procedure, but for some patients, in whom it was not possible to elucidate predictive factors, complications developed.\n All patients, particularly those with OIs of greater than 20, require careful monitoring during and after the procedure.\n","id":"PMC7095174","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Springer-Verlag","authors":[{"firstname":"Margarita","surname":"Burmester","email":"margivan@hotmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Quen","surname":"Mok","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1097/PCC.0000000000000435","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Nonpulmonary Treatments for Pediatric Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome: Proceedings From the Pediatric Acute Lung Injury Consensus Conference","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1542/peds.2008-1987","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Functional Status Scale: new pediatric outcome measure","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.3389/fped.2016.00051","date":"2016-05-02","title":"Relevant Outcomes in Pediatric Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Studies","abstract":"Despite distinct epidemiology and outcomes, pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (PARDS) is often managed based on evidence extrapolated from treatment of adults.\n The impact of non-pulmonary processes on mortality as well as the lower mortality rate compared to adults with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) renders the utilization of short-term mortality as a primary outcome measure for interventional studies problematic.\n However, data regarding alternatives to mortality are profoundly understudied, and proposed alternatives, such as ventilator-free days, may be themselves subject to hidden biases.\n Given the neuropsychiatric and functional impairment in adult survivors of ARDS, characterization of these morbidities in children with PARDS is of paramount importance.\n The purpose of this review is to frame these challenges in the context of the existing pediatric literature, and using adult ARDS as a guide, suggest potential clinically relevant outcomes that deserve further investigation.\n The goal is to identify important areas of study in order to better define clinical practice and facilitate future interventional trials in PARDS.\n","id":"PMC4865511","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Frontiers Media S.A.","authors":[{"firstname":"Nadir","surname":"Yehya","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Neal J.","surname":"Thomas","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1136/thorax.55.7.587","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Pediatric origins of adult lung disease. 1.

On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. Data from China have indicated that older adults, particularly those with serious underlying health conditions, are at higher risk for severe COVID-19-associated illness and death than are younger persons. Although the majority of reported COVID-19 cases in China were mild (81%), approximately 80% of deaths occurred among adults aged &gt;=60 years; only one (0.1%) death occurred in a person aged &lt;=19 years. In this report, COVID-19 cases in the United States that occurred during February 12-March 16, 2020 and severity of disease (hospitalization, admission to intensive care unit [ICU], and death) were analyzed by age group. As of March 16, a total of 4,226 COVID-19 cases in the United States had been reported to CDC, with multiple cases reported among older adults living in long-term care facilities. Overall, 31% of cases, 45% of hospitalizations, 53% of ICU admissions, and 80% of deaths associated with COVID-19 were among adults aged &gt;=65 years with the highest percentage of severe outcomes among persons aged &gt;=85 years. In contrast, no ICU admissions or deaths were reported among persons aged &lt;=19 years. Similar to reports from other countries, this finding suggests that the risk for serious disease and death from COVID-19 is higher in older age groups.\nData from cases reported from 49 states, the District of Columbia, and three U.S. territories to CDC during February 12-March 16 were analyzed. Cases among persons repatriated to the United States from Wuhan, China and from Japan (including patients repatriated from cruise ships) were excluded. States and jurisdictions voluntarily reported data on laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 using previously developed data collection forms. The cases described in this report include both COVID-19 cases confirmed by state or local public health laboratories as well as those with a positive test at the state or local public health laboratories and confirmation at CDC. No data on serious underlying health conditions were available. Data on these cases are preliminary and are missing for some key characteristics of interest, including hospitalization status (1,514), ICU admission (2,253), death (2,001), and age (386). Because of these missing data, the percentages of hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and deaths (case-fatality percentages) were estimated as a range. The lower bound of these percentages was estimated by using all cases within each age group as denominators. The corresponding upper bound of these percentages was estimated by using only cases with known information on each outcome as denominators.\nAs of March 16, a total of 4,226 COVID-19 cases had been reported in the United States, with reports increasing to 500 or more cases per day beginning March 14 (Figure 1). Among 2,449 patients with known age, 6% were aged &gt;=85, 25% were aged 65-84 years, 18% each were aged 55-64 years and 45-54 years, and 29% were aged 20-44 years (Figure 2). Only 5% of cases occurred in persons aged 0-19 years.\nNumber of new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases reported daily*,  (N = 4,226) : United States, February 12-March 16, 2020\n* Includes both COVID-19 cases confirmed by state or local public health laboratories, as well as those testing positive at the state or local public health laboratories and confirmed at CDC.\n  Cases identified before February 28 were aggregated and reported during March 1-3.\nThe figure is a histogram, an epidemiologic curve showing 4,226 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases, by date of case report, in the United States during February 12-March 16, 2020.\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) hospitalizations,* intensive care unit (ICU) admissions,  and deaths,  by age group : United States, February 12- March 16, 2020\n* Hospitalization status missing or unknown for 1,514 cases.\n  ICU status missing or unknown for 2,253 cases.\n  Illness outcome or death missing or unknown for 2,001 cases.\nThe figure is a bar chart showing the number of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) hospitalizations, intensive care unit admissions, and deaths, by age group, in the United States during February 12- March 16, 2020.\nAmong 508 (12%) patients known to have been hospitalized, 9% were aged &gt;=85 years, 36% were aged 65-84 years, 17% were aged 55-64 years, 18% were 45-54 years, and 20% were aged 20-44 years. Less than 1% of hospitalizations were among persons aged &lt;=19 years (Figure 2). The percentage of persons hospitalized increased with age, from 2%-3% among persons aged &lt;=19 years, to &gt;=31% among adults aged &gt;=85 years. (Table).\nHospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and case-fatality percentages for reported COVID-19 cases, by age group :United States, February 12-March 16, 2020\nAge group (yrs) (no. of cases)	%*	 	Hospitalization	ICU admission	Case-fatality	 	0-19 (123)	1.6-2.5	0	0	 	20-44 (705)	14.3-20.8	2.0-4.2	0.1-0.2	 	45-54 (429)	21.2-28.3	5.4-10.4	0.5-0.8	 	55-64 (429)	20.5-30.1	4.7-11.2	1.4-2.6	 	65-74 (409)	28.6-43.5	8.1-18.8	2.7-4.9	 	75-84 (210)	30.5-58.7	10.5-31.0	4.3-10.5	 	&gt;=85 (144)	31.3-70.3	6.3-29.0	10.4-27.3	 	Total (2,449)	20.7-31.4	4.9-11.5	1.8-3.4	 	\n* Lower bound of range = number of persons hospitalized, admitted to ICU, or who died among total in age group; upper bound of range = number of persons hospitalized, admitted to ICU, or who died among total in age group with known hospitalization status, ICU admission status, or death.\nAmong 121 patients known to have been admitted to an ICU, 7% of cases were reported among adults &gt;=85 years, 46% among adults aged 65-84 years, 36% among adults aged 45-64 years, and 12% among adults aged 20-44 years (Figure 2). No ICU admissions were reported among persons aged &lt;=19 years. Percentages of ICU admissions were lowest among adults aged 20-44 years (2%-4%) and highest among adults aged 75-84 years (11%-31%) (Table).\nAmong 44 cases with known outcome, 15 (34%) deaths were reported among adults aged &gt;=85 years, 20 (46%) among adults aged 65-84 years, and nine (20%) among adults aged 20-64 years. Case-fatality percentages increased with increasing age, from no deaths reported among persons aged &lt;=19 years to highest percentages (10%-27%) among adults aged &gt;=85 years (Table) (Figure 2).\nDiscussion\nSince February 12, 4,226 COVID-19 cases were reported in the United States; 31% of cases, 45% of hospitalizations, 53% of ICU admissions, and 80% of deaths occurred among adults aged &gt;=65 years with the highest percentage of severe outcomes among persons aged &gt;=85 years. These findings are similar to data from China, which indicated &gt;80% of deaths occurred among persons aged &gt;=60 years. These preliminary data also demonstrate that severe illness leading to hospitalization, including ICU admission and death, can occur in adults of any age with COVID-19. In contrast, persons aged &lt;=19 years appear to have milder COVID-19 illness, with almost no hospitalizations or deaths reported to date in the United States in this age group. Given the spread of COVID-19 in many U.S. communities, CDC continues to update current recommendations and develop new resources and guidance, including for adults aged &gt;=65 years as well as those involved in their care.\nApproximately 49 million U.S. persons are aged &gt;=65 years, and many of these adults, who are at risk for severe COVID-19-associated illness, might depend on services and support to maintain their health and independence. To prepare for potential COVID-19 illness among persons at high risk, family members and caregivers of older adults should know what medications they are taking and ensure that food and required medical supplies are available. Long-term care facilities should be particularly vigilant to prevent the introduction and spread of COVID-19. In addition, clinicians who care for adults should be aware that COVID-19 can result in severe disease among persons of all ages. Persons with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should monitor their symptoms and call their provider for guidance if symptoms worsen or seek emergency care for persistent severe symptoms. Additional guidance is available for health care providers on CDC's website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/hcp/index.html).\nThis report describes the current epidemiology of COVID-19 in the United States, using preliminary data. The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, data were missing for key variables of interest. Data on age and outcomes, including hospitalization, ICU admission, and death, were missing for 9%-53% of cases, which likely resulted in an underestimation of these outcomes. Second, further time for follow-up is needed to ascertain outcomes among active cases. Third, the initial approach to testing was to identify patients among those with travel histories or persons with more severe disease, and these data might overestimate the prevalence of severe disease. Fourth, data on other risk factors, including serious underlying health conditions that could increase risk for complications and severe illness, were unavailable at the time of this analysis. Finally, limited testing to date underscores the importance of ongoing surveillance of COVID-19 cases. Additional investigation will increase the understanding about persons who are at risk for severe illness and death from COVID-19 and inform clinical guidance and community-based mitigation measures.*\nThe risk for serious disease and death in COVID-19 cases among persons in the United States increases with age. Social distancing is recommended for all ages to slow the spread of the virus, protect the health care system, and help protect vulnerable older adults. Further, older adults should maintain adequate supplies of nonperishable foods and at least a 30-day supply of necessary medications, take precautions to keep space between themselves and others, stay away from those who are sick, avoid crowds as much as possible, avoid cruise travel and nonessential air travel, and stay home as much as possible to further reduce the risk of being exposed. Persons of all ages and communities can take actions to help slow the spread of COVID-19 and protect older adults. \nSummary\nWhat is already known about this topic?\nEarly data from China suggest that a majority of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) deaths have occurred among adults aged &gt;=60 years and among persons with serious underlying health conditions.\nWhat is added by this report?\nThis first preliminary description of outcomes among patients with COVID-19 in the United States indicates that fatality was highest in persons aged &gt;=85, ranging from 10% to 27%, followed by 3% to 11% among persons aged 65-84 years, 1% to 3% among persons aged 55-64 years, &lt;1% among persons aged 20-54 years, and no fatalities among persons aged &lt;=19 years.\nWhat are the implications for public health practice?\nCOVID-19 can result in severe disease, including hospitalization, admission to an intensive care unit, and death, especially among older adults. Everyone can take actions, such as social distancing, to help slow the spread of COVID-19 and protect older adults from severe illness.\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/community-mitigation-strategy.pdf.\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/03.16.20_coronavirus-guidance_8.5x11_315PM.pdf.\nAll authors have completed and submitted the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors form for disclosure of potential conflicts of interest.

We investigated the temporal progression in patients with COVID-19.\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, single-center study, we included confirmed cases of COVID-19 from Jan 20 to Feb 6, 2020 in Shanghai. Final date of follow-up was February 25, 2020.\nResults\nOf the 249 patients enrolled, the median age was 51 years old, and 126 (50.6%) were male. The duration from onset of symptoms to hospitalization was 4(2-7) days in symptomatic patients. Fever was occurred in 235(94.3%) patients. A total of 215 (86.3%) patients had been discharged after 16(12-20) days hospitalization. The estimated median duration of fever in all the patients with fever was 10 days (95 confidential intervals [CIs]: 8-11 days) after onset of symptoms. Patients who were transferred to intensive care units (ICU) had significantly longer duration of fever as compared to those not in ICU (31 days v.s. 9 days after onset of symptoms, respectively, P &lt;0.0001). Radiological aggravation of initial image was observed in 163 (65.7%) patients on day 7 after onset of symptoms. 154(94.5%) of these patients showed radiological improvement on day 14. The median duration to negative reverse-transcriptase PCR tests of upper respiratory tract samples was 11 days (95 CIs: 10-12 days). Viral clearance was more likely to be delayed in patients in ICU than those not in ICU (P &lt;0.0001). In multivariate logistical analysis, age (Odds ratio [OR] = 1.06) and CD4 T cell count (OR = 0.55 per 100 cells/ul increase) were independently associated with ICU admission.\nConclusions\nThe majority of COVID-19 cases are mild. The clinical progression pattern suggests that early control of viral replication and application of host-directed therapy in later stage is essential to improve the prognosis of CVOID-19.\nIntroduction\nIn December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown origins occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. Thanks to the high-throughput sequencing technology, the pathogen that caused this series of pneumonia was soon identified.   This novel beta coronavirus is now named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease is also named 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-2019). \nSimilar to other coronavirus, human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 pneumonia has been confirmed in case reports. The disease has rapidly spread from Wuhan to other areas in China, as well as other countries including Japan, Korea, Italy, USA and Germany et al. Therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recently declared the COVID-2019 a public health emergency of international concern. As of Feb 29, 2020, a total of 85,403 cases of confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia have been reported worldwide. \nThe clinical characteristics of the COVID-19 have been partially reported. Huang et al. first described 41 cases of COVID-19 in which most patients had a history of exposure to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. Subsequently, Chen et al. and Wang et al. reported findings from 99 cases and 138 cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan, respectively, suggesting that elderly with comorbidities were prone to develop acute respiratory depress syndrome (ARDS).   Initial presentation of 13 confirmed patients outside Wuhan has also been revealed. Most recently, Guan et al. delineated the clinical characteristics of the largest case series of COVID-19 in China, which confirmed the epidemic spreads rapidly by human-to-human transmission and that the disease severity predict poor clinical outcomes. However, the clinical course of the COVID-19 is still not clear. Herein, we collected data from 249 laboratory confirmed cases, aiming to present the clinical progress of the COVID-19.\nMethods\nStudy design and participants\nFor this retrospective, single-center study, we recruited patients from Jan 20 to Feb 6, 2020, at Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center (SPHCC), Shanghai, China. SPHCC is the pointed hospital that treat COVID-19 for adults in Shanghai. All patients with COVID-19 enrolled in this study were diagnosed according to Chinese national guideline for COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment, as well as the World Health Organization interim guidance. The study was approved by Ethics Committee of SPHCC and informed consent was obtained from patients involved before data were collected retrospectively. Informed consent was waived for patients unable to obtain an informed consent (i.e., those discharged or died).\nProcedures\nEpidemiological, demographic, underlying comorbidities, symptoms, signs, laboratory findings, X-ray, chest computed tomographic (CT) scans, treatment and outcome data were obtained from patients' medical records. The final date of follow-up was Feb 25, 2020. In clinical practice, body temperature was measured by means of digital thermometers. The parents were asked to take their body temperatures at least four times a day or even more frequently when the fever was high. Defervescence was defined as patients maintained normal body temperature without any antipyretics (e.g., nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, corticosteroid).\nPCR of SARS-CoV-2 for the upper respiratory specimens was not tested every day after admission. For patients with repeated PCR tests, the first date of the result was recorded if the patients had consecutive negative results, while the latest result and date were recorded for patients who had inconsistent results of the consecutive tests.\nLaboratory confirmation and SARS-CoV-2 PCR\nLaboratory confirmation of the SARS-CoV-2 was achieved by the Chinese Center for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC). Subsequent test of upper respiratory tract samples for SARS-CoV-2 after admission was performed by both SPHCC and CDC based on the recommendation by the National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention (China) (http://ivdc.chinacdc.cn/kyjz/202001/t20200121_211337.html).\nStatistical analysis\nDepending on the distribution of the data, categorical variables were described as frequency rates and percentages, and continuous variables were described with mean, median, and interquartile range (IQR) values. Means for continuous variables were compared via independent group t tests when the data were normally distributed; otherwise, the Mann-Whitney test was used. Proportions for categorical variables were compared by the chi2 test. Wilcoxon ranksum tests were used for nonnormally distributed data. The median time to temperature normalization and viral clearance was examined by Kaplan-Meier estimates. The association between baseline clinical characteristics, laboratory results and intensive care unit (ICU) admission was calculated with logistical regression. All analyses were performed using STATA v12.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX). The figures were constructed using GRAPHPAD PRISM 8.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA).\nResults\nClinical and laboratory characteristics of the study population on admission\nClinical presentation and pertinent laboratory findings of patient population with COVID-19 (N = 249).\nTable 1	 	\nClinical characteristics, symptoms or signs		 	Age, years		 	 Median(interquartile range)	51(36-64)	 	Sex		 	 Male (N,%)	126 (50.6%)	 	Days from one set of symptoms (days)	4(2-7)	 	Signs and symptoms at admission (N,%)		 	 Fever	217(87.1%)	 	 Cough	91(36.5%)	 	 Fatigue	39(15.7%)	 	 Dizziness and headache	28(11.2%)	 	 Shortness of breath	19(7.6%)	 	 Rhinorrhoea	17(6.8%)	 	 Sore throat	16(6.4%)	 	 Diarrhea	8(3.2%)	 	 Inappetence	8(3.2%)	 	 Asymptomatic	7(2.8%)	 	Comorbidity (N,%)	90(36.1%)	 	 Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases	55(21.7%)	 	 Endocrine system diseases	25(10.0%)	 	 Digestive system diseases	9(3.6%)	 	 Respiratory system diseases	5(2.0%)	 	 Chronic hepatitis B virus infection	2(0.8%)	 	 Malignant tumor	1(0.4%)	 	Laboratory findings		 	 White blood cells (x  109 per L)	4.71(3.80-5.86)	 	 Lymphocytes (x  109 per L)	1.12(0.79-1.49)	 	 C-reactive protein (mg/L)	12(4.4-29.4)	 	 Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (mm/h)	54(33-90)	 	 Alanine aminotransferase (U/L)	23(15-33)	 	 Aspartate aminotransferase (U/L)	25(20-33)	 	 Albumin (g/L)	40.8(37.9-43.0)	 	 Lactate dehydrogenase (U/L)	229(195-291)	 	 Lactate (mmol/L)	1.4(1.1-2.1)	 	 Estimated glomerular filtration rate (mL/min/1.73m2)	109.2(95.3-127.2)	 	 CD4 T cells counts (cells/uL)	431(299-637)	 	 CD4/CD8 ratio	1.68(1.24-1.33)	 	\nAs of Feb 6, 2020, a total of 249 patients were enrolled in this study. The median age was 51 years old (IQR, 36-64 years), and 126 (50.6%) were male. The duration from onset of symptoms to hospital admission was 4(2-7) days in patients with symptoms. Ninety patients (36.1%) had one or more coexisting chronic medical conditions. Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases were the most common comorbidities (55[21.7%]), followed by endocrine system diseases (25[10.0%]). The most common symptoms at onset of illness were fever 217[87.1%], cough (91[36.5%]) and fatigue (39[15.7%]). Less common symptoms included dizziness and headache, shortness of breath, rhinorrhoea, sore throat, diarrhea and inappetence (Table 1 ). Seven patients (2.8%) who were close contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases were asymptomatic while RT-PCR results were positive in their throat-swab samples.\nOn admission, leukopenia and lymphopenia were observed in 28.9% and 47.4% of the patients, respectively. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was increased in 85.5% of the patients, while C-reactive protein (CRP) was elevated in more than half of the patients. Elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase were less common as well as decreased level of the estimated glomerular filtration rate. CD4 T cells count was decreased in 45.4% of the patients while CD4/CD8 ratio was normal in 92.8% of the patients.\nTreatment and outcomes of the study population\nAll of these patients were admitted to negative pressure isolation wards. Patients were given supportive treatment after admission. Antiviral drugs (e.g., lopinavir/ritonavir, arbidol) were tried in a small proportion of patients. Corticosteroid was not used unless a panel discussion by experts considered necessary (e.g., ARDS). A total of 22(8.8%) patients were admitted in ICU 8.5 +- 4.0 days after onset of symptoms. A total of 8(3.2%) patients developed ARDS 4.8 +- 2.4 days after onset of symptoms. To the time of submission, a total of 215 (86.3%) patients were discharged after 16(12-20) days hospitalization, 13 patients were still in ICU and 19 patients in stable condition. A total of 2 patients died (0.8%).\nDefervescence in the study population\nDuration of fever in patients in ICU and not in ICU from onset of symptoms. ICU: intensive care units.\nFig. 1:\nAs fever was the most common symptoms among patients with COVID-19, we investigated the duration of fever in this population. Fever occurred in 18 of the 32 patients (56.2%) who were afebrile on admission, including one asymptomatic patient. Therefore, a total of 235(94.3%) patients had fever during their clinical course. In most of the patients (203[86.4%]), body temperature gradually dropped and returned normal with or without supportive therapy after admission. Corticosteroid was used in 32(12.9%) patients. The estimated median duration of fever in all the patients with fever was 10 days (95 confidential intervals [CIs: 8-11 days]) after onset of symptoms. Patients who were transferred to ICU had significantly longer duration of fever as compared to those who were stable (median duration of fever: 31 days v.s. 9 days after onset of symptoms, respectively, P &lt;0.0001, Fig. 1 ). Corticosteroid was used in 13 patients in ICU. However, their body temperatures were not normalized until 20.7 +- 6.8 days after onset of symptoms. Most of the other symptoms including cough, fatigue and diarrhea also waived before defervescence.\nRadiological changes in disease progression\nComputed tomographic (CT) scans of two patients.\nCase 1: Chest CT scans on admission of a 75 years old female on day 3 after onset of symptoms (A). CT scan showed worsening on day 6 manifested by bilateral multiple ground-glass opacities (B); Chest CT scan on day 9 showed improved status (C).\nCase 2: Chest CT scans on admission of a 30 years old on day 5 after onset of symptoms (D). Improvement of original lesions together with the appearance of new lesions on day 10 (E). Chest CT scan on day 13 showed worsening status (F).\nFig. 2:\nOn admission, 203 patients manifested bilateral pneumonia in X-ray or chest computed tomography (Fig. 2 ) and 39 patients showed unilateral lesion. CT scan result was normal in another 6 patients. Of the 248 patients with repeated radiology examination, the image showed progression in 163 (65.7%) patients after a median of 3 days (that is the 7th day after onset of symptoms), including three patients whose images were normal on admission. The images presented shifting of radiological lesions, which was characterized by improvement of original lesions together with the appearance of new lesions. Some patients showed worsening of original lesions with or without development of new lesions. Images presented disease relief in 56(22.6%) patients and stable condition in 30(12.1%) patients, respectively. Among those patients with radiological worsening, 91 patients did another radiological examination after a median of 6 days (median 14 days after onset of symptoms). 154(94.5%) patients at this point showed improvement, while 1(0.6%) and 8(4.9%) patients showed stable condition and deterioration in images, respectively.\nViral clearance in the upper respiratory route\nTime to a negative conversion of virus by PCR analysis of upper respiratory tract samples.\nFig. 3:\nA total of 248 patients had PCR tested for SARS-COV-2 in upper respiratory tract specimens during this observation period. All of them had at least two repeated tests. The estimated median time from initiation of symptoms to PCR negative was 11 days (95 CIs: 10-12 days) in all the patients. In asymptomatic patients, PCR turned to be negative 2(1-3) days after admission. However, the estimated median time from initiation of symptoms to PCR conversation was significantly longer in patients in ICU than those not in ICU (Fig. 3 , P &lt;0.0001). In a Cox proportional hazards regression model, CD4 T cell counts on admission (HR = 1.07 per 100cells/uL increase, P = 0.02), older age (HR = 0.99 per year, P = 0.02), and asymptomatic (HR = 14.3, P &lt;0.0001) were all independently associated with early PCR conversion.\nFactors associated with ICU admission\nFactors associated with intensive care units admission.\nTable 2:	 	\n	Univariate logistic regression	Multivariate logistic regression	 		OR	95% CI	P value	OR	95% CI	P value	 	Age	1.08	1.04-1.13	&lt;0.001	1.06	1.00-1.12	0.046	 	Male	7.10	2.04-24.07	0.002	3.38	0.77-14.9	0.11	 	Comorbidity	4.34	1.70-11.10	0.002	1.83	0.50-6.75	0.36	 	Fever	1.52	0.34-6.85	0.14				 	White blood cells (x  109 per L)	1.28	1.08-1.52	0.004	1.07	0.79-1.45	0.66	 	Lymphocytes (x  109 per L)	0.24	0.08-0.75	0.01	4.05	0.89-18.5	0.07	 	C-reactive protein (mg/L)	1.04	1.02-1.05	&lt;0.001	1.01	0.99-1.03	0.58	 	Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (mm/h)	1.00	0.99-1.02	0.58				 	Albumin (g/L)	0.75	0.66-0.85	&lt;0.001	0.95	0.78-1.16	0.60	 	Alanine aminotransferase (U/L)	1.01	1.0-1.03	0.15				 	Aspartate aminotransferase (U/L)	1.02	1.0-1.03	0.05	0.99	0.96-1.03	0.86	 	Albumin (g/L)	0.75	0.66-0.85	&lt;0.001	0.95	0.78-1.16	0.60	 	Lactate dehydrogenase (U/L)	1.01	1.0-1.02	&lt;0.001	1.01	1.0-1.02	0.08	 	Lactate (mmol/L)	1.23	0.88-1.70	0.22				 	Estimated glomerular filtration rate (mL/min/1.73m2)	0.98	0.96-0.99	&lt;0.001	0.99	0.89-1.02	0.89	 	CD4 T cell counts (Per 100 cells/uL)	0.45	0.31-0.64	&lt;0.001	0.55	0.33-0.92	0.02	 	Radiological lesion	4.46	0.62-31.9	0.14				 	\nCI: Confidential interval, OR: Odds ratio.\nTrying to find factors that were associated with poor outcome, we then compared clinical and laboratory characters of patients admitted in ICU (N = 22) and non-ICU (N = 227). In univariate analysis, male gender, older age, high levels of white blood cell count, lymphocyte cell count, CRP, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), low levels of albumin, estimated glomerular filtration rate and CD4 T cells count were all associated with the development of ARDS (Table 2 ). In multivariate logistical analysis, older age (OR=1.06), CD4 T cell counts (OR=0.55 per 100 cells/ul increase) were all independently associated with ICU admission (Table 2).\nDiscussion\nStudies on COVID-19 have generally been limited to the description of the epidemiology characteristics, initial clinical, hematological and radiological findings. To our knowledge, this is the first report to date that describes the temporal clinical progression of COVID-19.\nIn the current study, most of the cases were mild as evidenced by relatively low rates of ICU admission and high rate of cure rate. This is inconsistent with a recent report which showed more than 80% of COVID-19 cases were mild in China. However, nearly 10% were severe and critical, indicating that exploring the clinical progression and possible mechanisms is essential to the disease control.\nThe clinical progression of COVID-19 in our patients showed a biphasic pattern. The first phase was characterised by fever, cough, fatigue and other systemic symptoms. In consistent with previous studies, we found that fever was the most common symptom in patients with COVID-19. As high as 94.3% of the patients in this study, including those who were afebrile on admission had fever. Guan et al. recently showed that only 43.8% of the patients with COVID-19 on presentation but developed fever in 87.9% following hospitalization, indicating the afebrile patients may be at the early stage of the disease. During this first phase, consistent with fever, the disease progressed as evidenced by radiological worsening within 7 days after onset of symptoms. The disease progression during this time could be explained by uncontrolled viral replication as most majority of the patients showed positive results for SARS-CoV-2 PCR from their upper respiratory specimen.\nAs the disease progressed into week 2, symptoms began to relieve in most of the patients. 10 days after onset of symptoms, half of the patients were estimated to restore normal body temperature. The duration of fever was comparable to that in patients with SARS (11.4 days), but longer than those with MERS (8 days [range, 0-54 days]) and other coronavirus diseases. However, different from SARS, whose patients frequently had recurrence of fever in week 2, most of the patients with COVID-19 had normal temperature thereafter. In line with defervescence, half of the patients also became PCR negative with their upper respiratory tract samples. In addition, radiological improvement was observed in 94.5% of the patients whose radiological images showed worsening in the first week.\nThe median time to viral clearance in this study was 11 days after onset of symptoms, which was significantly shorter than that in MERS (17 days), indicating it is virulence maybe lower than MERS. Actually, most of the patients are able to clear the virus and their clinical course fit the biphasic model well. However, viral clearance was observed in only a small proportion of patients in ICU. Therefore, the clinical progression in these severe cases may not fit this biphasic model. Indeed, patients admitted to ICU were unable to defervesce without corticosteroid therapy or had significantly longer duration of fever compared with those in the non-ICU group. Persistent fever, lung damage and diseases progression could be partially explained by uncontrolled viral replication. To reduce the risk of disease progression and poor outcome, an effective antiviral to early reduce the viral load may be important. Several drugs are potential candidates to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication, including remdesivir which is under clinical trial. \nThe host immune responses against the SARS-CoV-2 may also contribute substantially to COVID-19 pathogenesis. In the current study, both older age and lower CD4 T cells count, indicators of immunosuppression, were significantly associated with ICU admission. For our patients who stayed in ICU, elevated interleukin 6 levels had been observed (data not shown), which is in consistent with the previous reports.   Therefore, the persistence of COVID-19 induced excessive but aberrant non-effective response which is associated with cytokine storm.   A small proportion of patients developed ARDS early in the clinical course and five of the patients in ICU did not improve significantly after viral control. Consistently, inflammation persists after viral clearance in SARS. Taken together, these evidences indicate that disease progression may be a result of an over exuberant host response. Along this line, apart from effective antiviral agents which could decrease viral load at the early stage and in turn result in decreased immunopathological damage, the role of host-directed therapy could be an important tool to reduce the mortality. \nTheoretically, corticosteroid treatment could have a role in the treatment of COVID-19 as it suppress lung inflammation. Despite of fever persistence and radiological worsening in the first week, most of the patients had normal temperature and improvement in images with or without supportive therapy from the second week after onset of symptoms. Most importantly, corticosteroid had been shown to delay clearance of MERS-CoV from respiratory tract and SARS-CoV from blood, respectively.   In the current study, delayed COVID-19 clearance was associated with ICU admission. Therefore, in agreement with the WHO guideline, we are against the usage of corticosteroid for the treatment of COVID-19.   \nThere are some limitations of our study. First, a small proportion the patients were still hospitalized at the time of manuscript submission. Therefore, clinical outcomes in these patients were not available and continued observations are still needed. Second, we did not test SARS-CoV-2 daily for everybody. Hence, the actual duration to viral clearance should be shorter than the estimated one. Meanwhile, we did not quantify the viral load of the SARS-CoV-2 and false negative of the PCR result for upper respiratory sample has also been reported. For that reason, studies on the dynamic changes of the viral load are still warranted.\nIn summary, the majority of COVID-19 cases are mild.

associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China,

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in

NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.\n\n Increasing quartile of NLR was statistically significantly associated with secondary outcome.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR is associated with outcomes in unselected critically ill patients.\n\n In patients with sepsis, there was no statistically significant relationship between NLR and mortality.\n\n Further investigation is required to increase understanding of the pathophysiology of this relationship and to validate these findings with data collected prospectively.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article

a major threat to public health1–3.\n Despite intense research efforts, how, when and where new diseases appear are still a source of considerable uncertainty.\n A severe respiratory disease was recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China5.\n This outbreak highlights the ongoing ability of viral spill-over from animals to cause

the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing Municipal Science and Technology

data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7092819","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical Society","authors":[{"firstname":"Wei-jie","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng-yi","surname":"Ni","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng-yi","surname":"Ni","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yu","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wen-hua","surname":"Liang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chun-quan","surname":"Ou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jian-xing","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Shan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chun-liang","surname":"Lei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"David S.C.","surname":"Hui","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Du","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lan-juan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guang","surname":"Zeng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kwok-Yung","surname":"Yuen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ru-chong","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chun-li","surname":"Tang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tao","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ping-yan","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jie","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shi-yue","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jin-lin","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zi-jing","surname":"Liang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi-xiang","surname":"Peng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Li","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ya-hua","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Peng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jian-ming","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ji-yang","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhong","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gang","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhi-jian","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shao-qin","surname":"Qiu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jie","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chang-jiang","surname":"Ye","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shao-yong","surname":"Zhu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nan-shan","surname":"Zhong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1093/cid/ciaa199","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical Characteristics of Imported Cases of COVID-19 in Jiangsu Province: A Multicenter Descriptive Study","abstract":"Background\nWe aimed to report the clinical characteristics of imported coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) in Jiangsu Province.\n\n\nMethods\nWe retrospectively investigated the clinical, imaging, and laboratory characteristics of confirmed cases of COVID-19 with WHO interim guidance in three Grade ?A hospitals of Jiangsu from Jan 22 to Feb 14, 2020.

synthesis","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>The COVID-19 pandemic has placed an unprecedented strain on health systems, with rapidly increasing demand for healthcare in hospitals and intensive care units (ICUs) worldwide.\n\n As the pandemic escalates, determining the resulting needs for healthcare resources (beds, staff, equipment) has become a key priority for many countries.\n\n Projecting future demand requires estimates of how long patients with COVID-19 need different levels of hospital care.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>We performed a systematic review of early evidence on length of stay (LoS) of patients with COVID-19 in hospital and in ICU.\n\n We subsequently developed a method to generate LoS distributions which combines summary statistics reported in multiple studies, accounting for differences in sample sizes.\n\n Applying this approach, we provide distributions for total hospital and ICU LoS from studies in China and elsewhere, for use by the community.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>We identified 52 studies, the majority from China (46/52).\n\n Median hospital LoS ranged from 4 to 53 days within China, and 4 to 21 days outside of China, across 45 studies.\n\n ICU LoS was reported by eight studies—four each within and outside China—with median values ranging from 6 to 12 and 4 to 19 days, respectively.\n\n Our summary distributions have a median hospital LoS of 14 (IQR 10–19) days for China, compared with 5 (IQR 3–9) days outside of China.\n\n For ICU, the summary distributions are more similar (median (IQR) of 8 (5–13) days for China and 7 (4–11) days outside of China).\n\n There was a visible difference by discharge status, with patients who were discharged alive having longer LoS than those who died during their admission, but no trend associated with study date.\n\n\nConclusion\nid='Par4'>Patients with COVID-19 in China appeared to remain in hospital for longer than elsewhere.\n\n This may be explained by differences in criteria for admission and discharge between countries, and different timing within the pandemic.\n\n In the absence of local data, the combined summary LoS distributions provided here can be used to model bed demands for contingency planning and then updated, with the novel method presented here, as more studies with aggregated statistics emerge outside China.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7467845","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Eleanor

Comparisons between the viruses were made.\n\n\nResults\nInadequate risk assessment regarding the urgency of the situation, and limited reporting on the virus within China has, in part, led to the rapid spread of COVID-19 throughout mainland China and into proximal and distant countries.\n\n Compared with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has spread more rapidly, due in part to increased globalization and the focus of the epidemic.\n\n Wuhan, China is a large hub connecting the North, South, East and West of China via railways and a major international airport.\n\n The availability of connecting flights, the timing of the outbreak during the Chinese (Lunar) New Year, and the massive rail transit hub located in Wuhan has enabled the virus to perforate throughout China, and eventually, globally.\n\n\nConclusions\nWe conclude that we did not learn from the two prior epidemics of coronavirus and were ill-prepared to deal with the challenges the COVID-19 epidemic has posed.\n\n Future research should attempt to address the uses and implications of internet of things (IoT) technologies for mapping the spread of infection.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7197734","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Oxford University Press","authors":[{"firstname":"Noah C","surname":"Peeri","email":"noah.peeri@my.unthsc.edu","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nistha","surname":"Shrestha","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Nistha","surname":"Shrestha","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Md Siddikur","surname":"Rahman","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rafdzah","surname":"Zaki","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhengqi","surname":"Tan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Saana","surname":"Bibi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mahdi","surname":"Baghbanzadeh","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nasrin","surname":"Aghamohammadi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wenyi","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ubydul","surname":"Haque","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1002/eji.202070035","date":"1970-01-01","title":"COVID?19: Lessons from SARS and MERS","abstract":"","id":"PMC7163482","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley and Sons Inc.","authors":[{"firstname":"Mirae","surname":"Park","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ryan S.","surname":"Thwaites","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Peter J.

associated with the duration of hospitalisation among COVID-19 patients in Vietnam: A survival analysis","abstract":"Background\nThe median duration of hospital stays due to COVID-19 has been reported in several studies on China as 10?13 days.\n\n Global studies have indicated that the length of hospitalisation depends on different factors, such as the time elapsed from exposure to symptom onset, and from symptom onset to hospital admission, as well as specificities of the country under study.\n\n The goal of this paper is to identify factors associated with the median duration of hospital stays of COVID-19 patients during the second COVID-19 wave that hit Vietnam from 5 March to 8 April 2020.\nMethod\nWe used retrospective data on 133 hospitalised patients with COVID-19 recorded over at least two weeks during the study period.\n\n The Cox proportional-hazards regression model was applied to determine the potential risk factors associated with length of hospital stay.\n\n\nResults\nThere were 65 (48.9%) females, 98 (73.7%) patients 48 years old or younger, 15 (11.3%) persons with comorbidities, 21 (16.0%) severely ill patients and 5 (3.8%) individuals with life-threatening conditions.\n\n Eighty-two (61.7%) patients were discharged after testing negative for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, 51 were still in the hospital at the end of the study period and none died.\n\n The median duration of stay in a hospital was 21 (IQR: 16–34) days.\n\n The multivariable Cox regression model showed that age, residence and sources of contamination were significantly associated with longer duration of hospitalisation.\n\n\nConclusion\nA close look at how long COVID-19 patients stayed in the hospital could provide an overview of their treatment process in Vietnam, and support the country's National Steering Committee on COVID-19 Prevention and Control in the efficient allocation of resources over the next stages of the COVID-19 prevention period.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7306545","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Cambridge University Press","authors":[{"firstname":"Pham

role and response of primary healthcare services in the delivery of palliative care in epidemics and pandemics: A rapid review to inform practice and service delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic","abstract":"Background:\nThe increased number of deaths in the community happening as a result of COVID-19 has caused primary healthcare services to change their traditional service delivery in a short timeframe.\n\n Services are quickly adapting to new challenges in the practical delivery of end-of-life care to patients in the community including through virtual consultations and in the provision of timely symptom control.\n\n\nAim:\nTo synthesise existing evidence related to the delivery of palliative and end-of-life care by primary healthcare professionals in epidemics and pandemics.\n\n\nDesign:\nRapid systematic review using modified systematic review methods, with narrative synthesis of the evidence.\n\n\nData sources:\nSearches were carried out in Medline, Embase, PsychINFO, CINAHL and Web of Science on 7th March 2020.\nResults:\nOnly five studies met the inclusion criteria, highlighting a striking lack of evidence base for the response of primary healthcare services in palliative care during epidemics and pandemics.\n\n All were observational studies.\n\n Findings were synthesised using a pandemic response framework according to ‘systems’ (community providers feeling disadvantaged in terms of receiving timely information and protocols), ‘space’ (recognised need for more care in the community), ‘staff’ (training needs and resilience) and ‘stuff’ (other aspects of managing care in pandemics including personal protective equipment, cleaning care settings and access to investigations).\n\n\nConclusions:\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic progresses, there is an urgent need for research to provide increased understanding of the role of primary care and community nursing services in palliative care, alongside hospices and community specialist palliative care providers.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7528540","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"SAGE

of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing

infections and immune responses","abstract":"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are by far the largest group of known positive?sense RNA viruses having an extensive range of natural hosts.\n In the past few decades, newly evolved Coronaviruses have posed a global threat to public health.\n The immune response is essential to control and eliminate CoV infections, however, maladjusted immune responses may result in immunopathology and impaired pulmonary gas exchange.\n Gaining a deeper understanding of the interaction between Coronaviruses and the innate immune systems of the hosts may shed light on the development and persistence of inflammation in the lungs and hopefully can reduce the risk of lung inflammation caused by CoVs.\n In this review, we provide an update on CoV infections and relevant diseases, particularly the host defense against CoV?induced inflammation of lung tissue, as well as the role of the innate immune system in the pathogenesis and clinical
