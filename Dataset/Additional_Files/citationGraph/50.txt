Though human coronaviruses have been recognised for many years but COVID 2019 was a new strain and its wide global spread sparkled panic among the common public (, CDC, 2020). Owing to the lack of immunity to this new strain of coronavirus, a large number of people at large are susceptible to it.\nVarious alarming video clippings featuring COVID 2019 are in circulation on social media and being accessed by almost all individuals through their smartphones/ computers in developing countries (, Telegraph, 2020). In India, the first suicidal case by a 50 year old man was reported from a village in Chittoor district of Andhra Pradesh on 12th Feb 2020. He was a father-of-three who was informed by his doctor that he had contracted some viral illness which he wrongly correlated to COVID 2019 as he was constantly obsessed with the videos where Chinese victims were shown to collapse in public and suspected patients were forced into health care facilities for quarantine against their will. He was so disturbed that in order to protect his family, he quarantined himself and pelted stones on his family and friends when they tried to approach him. Later due to his fear and panic that he had acquired COVID 2019, he ended his life by hanging himself from a tree (, Hindustan Times, 2020).\nIn an era of internet and technology, social media should have in-built algorithms which can automatically block video clippings from being uploaded at commonly accessed social networking sites which creates panic among the general public. Countries should have laws in place where forwarding of such sensational videos should be made punishable and such videos should be banned. Thus, social media should be a platform to disseminate the right education among the public so that everyone can enjoy the social media in a positive sense. During political turmoil in India, the Government puts a ban on internet services but strict and rapid action must be taken when unauthorized alarming videos are circulated related to public health issues (, Washington Post, 2020).\nFinancial disclosure\nNone\nContributors\nAll authors contributed equally\nPreviously published\nNone.\nDeclaration of Competing Interest\nNone.\nReferences\nCoronavirus: Indian man' died by suicide' after becoming convinced he was infected. https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/coronavirus-indian-man-died-suicide-becoming-convinced-infected/ (Accessed 14 Feb 2020).\nFearing he had contracted coronavirus, man locks family, kills himself. https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-suffering-from-cold-and-fever-commits-suicide-in-andhra-pradesh-feared-he-had-contracted-coronavirus-says-family/story-nECI2mhrvB5FiX2vHruFcK.html (Accessed 14 Feb 2020).\nHuman Coronavirus Types. https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/types.html (Accessed 14 Feb 2020).\nIndia's Internet shutdown in Kashmir is the longest ever in a democracy. https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/indias-internet-shutdown-in-kashmir-is-now-the-longest-ever-in-a-democracy/2019/12/15/bb0693ea-1dfc-11ea-977a-15a6710ed6da_story.html (Accessed 14 Feb 2020).\nKey considerations for repatriation and quarantine of travellers in relation to the outbreak of novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV. https://www.who.int/ith/Repatriation_Quarantine_nCoV-key-considerations_HQ-final11Feb.pdf?ua=1 (Accessed 14 Feb 2020).\n","References depth 1":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Coronavirus: Indian man' died by suicide' after becoming convinced he was infected. https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/coronavirus-indian-man-died-suicide-becoming-convinced-infected/ (Accessed 14 Feb 2020).","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Fearing he had contracted coronavirus, man locks family, kills himself. https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-suffering-from-cold-and-fever-commits-suicide-in-andhra-pradesh-feared-he-had-contracted-coronavirus-says-family/story-nECI2mhrvB5FiX2vHruFcK.html (Accessed 14 Feb 2020).","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Human Coronavirus Types. https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/types.html (Accessed 14 Feb 2020).","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"India's Internet shutdown in Kashmir is the longest ever in a democracy. https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/indias-internet-shutdown-in-kashmir-is-now-the-longest-ever-in-a-democracy/2019/12/15/bb0693ea-1dfc-11ea-977a-15a6710ed6da_story.html (Accessed 14 Feb 2020).","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Key considerations for repatriation and quarantine of travellers in relation to the outbreak of novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV. https://www.who.int/ith/Repatriation_Quarantine_nCoV-key-considerations_HQ-final11Feb.pdf?ua=1 (Accessed 14 Feb 2020).","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[]}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102073","date":"2020-04-02","title":"First COVID-19 suicide case in Bangladesh due to fear of COVID-19 and xenophobia: Possible suicide prevention strategies<","abstract":"","id":"PMC7139250","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"Elsevier B.V.","authors":[{"firstname":"Mohammed A.","surname":"Mamun","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Mark D.","surname":"Griffiths","email":"NULL","contributions":"7"}],"Full Text":"First COVID-19 suicide case in Bangladesh due to fear of COVID-19 and xenophobia: Possible suicide prevention strategies \nThe novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has become a global concern. Healthcare systems in many countries have been pushed to breaking point in an attempt to deal with the pandemic. At present, there is no accurate estimation about how long the COVID-19 situation will persist, the number of individuals worldwide who will be infected, or how long people's lives will be disrupted. Like previous epidemics and pandemics, the unpredictable consequences and uncertainty surrounding public safety, as well as misinformation about COVID-19 (particularly on social media) can often impact individuals' mental health including depression, anxiety, and traumatic stress.\nAdditionally, pandemic-related issues such as social distancing, isolation and quarantine, as well as the social and economic fallout can also trigger psychological mediators such as sadness, worry, fear, anger, annoyance, frustration, guilt, helplessness, loneliness, and nervousness. These are the common features of typical mental health suffering that many individuals will experience during and after the crisis. In extreme cases, such mental health issues can lead to suicidal behaviors (e.g., suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and actual suicide). It is well stablished that around 90 % of global suicides are due to individuals with mental health conditions such as depression. Similar situations have been reported in previous pandemics. For example, the suicide rate among elderly people increased in Hong Kong both during and after the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) pandemic in 2003.\nOn March 25 (2020), after returning from Dhaka, a Bangladeshi man from the village of Ramchandrapur committed suicide because he and the people in his village thought he was infected with COVID-19 based on his fever and cold symptoms and his weight loss. Due to the social avoidance and attitudes by others around him, he died by suicide in the village near his house. Unfortunately, the autopsy showed that the victim did not have COVID-19.\nThe main factor that drove the man to suicide was prejudice by the others in the village who thought he had COVID-19 even though there was no diagnosis. Arguably, the villagers were xenophobic towards the man. Although xenophobia is usually defined as a more specific fear or hatred of foreigners or strangers, xenophobia is actually the general fear of something foreign or strange (in this case COVID-19 rather than the victim's ethnicity). Given that the victim believed he had COVID-19, it is also thought that he committed suicide out of a moral duty to ensure he did not pass on the virus to anyone in his village.\nA very similar case was reported in India on April 12 (2020), where the victim, returning from a city to his native village, committed suicide to avoid spreading COVID-19 throughout the village. Based on these two cases, it appears that village people and the victim's moral conscience had major roles in contributing the suicides. In the south Asian country like Bangladesh and India, village people arguably less educated than those that live in cities. Therefore, elevated fears and misconceptions surrounding COVID-19 among villagers may have led to higher levels of xenophobia, and that xenophobia may have been a major contributing factor in committing suicide.\nSuicide is the ultimate human sacrifice for anyone who cannot bear the mental suffering. However, the fact that the fear of having COVID-19 led to suicide is preventable and suggests both research and prevention is needed to avoid such tragedies. At present, it is not known what the level of fear of COVID-19 is among the Bangladeshi population although levels of fear are high among countries where there have been many deaths such as Iran according to a recent study examining fear of COVID-19.\nWe would suggest there is an urgent need to carry out a nationwide epidemiological study to determine the level fear, worry, and helplessness, as well as other associated issues concerning mental health in relation to COVID-19. This would help in developing targeted mental wellbeing strategies (e.g., such as those who live in villages). Additional mental health care is also needed for patients confirmed as having COVID-19, patients with suspected COVID-19 infection, quarantined family members, and healthcare personnel.\nWe would also suggest the following to the general public: (i) avoid unreliable and non-credible news and information sources (such as that on social media and what neighbors say) to reduce fear and panic surrounding COVID-19, (ii) help individuals with known mental health issues (e.g., depression, anxiety) in appropriate ways such as consultation with healthcare professionals using telemedicine (i.e., online interventions) where possible, (iii) offer support and signposting for individuals displaying pre-suicidal behavior (i.e., talking about death and dying, expressing feelings of being hopeless and/or helpless, feeling like they are a burden or that they are trapped), (iv) offer basic help (e.g., foods, medicines) to those most in need during lock-down situations.\nWe would also recommend online-based mental health intervention programs as a way of promoting more reliable and authentic information about COVID-19, and making available possible telemedicine care, as suggested in recent previous papers. Finally, as suggested by, the role of a psychiatrist during a pandemic such as COVID-19 should include as (i) educating individuals about the common adverse psychological consequences, (ii) encouraging health-promoting behaviors among individuals, (iii) integrating available healthcare services, (iv) facilitate problem-solving, (v) empowering patients, their families, and health-care providers, and (vi) promoting self-care among health-care providers.\nRole of the funding source\nSelf-funded.\nFinancial disclosure\nThe authors involved in this research project do not have any relationships with other people or organizations that could inappropriately influence (bias) their work.\nDeclaration of Competing Interest\nThe authors of the correspondence do not have any conflict of interest.\nReferences\nFear of COVID-19 scale: development and initial validation\nThe COVID-19 outbreak: crucial role the psychiatrists can play\nA revisit on older adults' suicides and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic in Hong Kong\nFear of COVID 2019: first suicidal case in India\nOnline mental health services in China during the COVID-19 outbreak\nA rare case of Bangladeshi student suicide by gunshot due to unusual multiple causalities\nTimely mental health care for the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak is urgently needed\nRethinking online mental health services in China during the COVID-19 epidemic\nIranian mental health during the COVID-19 epidemic\nThe new version of the paper was published in April 2023 to comply with the journal policies concerning the privacy of personal information.

developed the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) to complement the clinical efforts in preventing the spread and treating of COVID-19 cases.\n\n\nMethods\nThe sample comprised 717 Iranian participants.\n\n The items of the FCV-19S were constructed based on extensive review of existing scales on fears, expert evaluations, and participant interviews.\n\n Several psychometric tests were conducted to ascertain its reliability and validity properties.\n\n\nResults\nAfter panel review and corrected item-total correlation testing, seven items with acceptable corrected item-total correlation (0.47 to 0.56) were retained and further confirmed by significant and strong factor loadings (0.66 to 0.74).\n\n Also, other properties evaluated using both classical test theory and Rasch model were satisfactory on the seven-item scale.\n\n More specifically, reliability values such as internal consistency (? = .\n\n82) and test–retest reliability (ICC = .\n\n72) were acceptable.\n\n Concurrent validity was supported by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (with depression, r = 0.425 and anxiety, r = 0.511) and the Perceived Vulnerability to Disease Scale (with perceived infectability, r = 0.483 and germ aversion, r = 0.459).\n\n\nConclusion\nThe Fear of COVID-19 Scale, a seven-item scale, has robust psychometric properties.\n\n It is reliable and valid in assessing fear of COVID-19 among the general population and will also be useful in allaying COVID-19 fears among individuals.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7100496","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Springer

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

ever since its onset and subsequent global spread had created several challenges for the general public and the health care workers across the World. COVID-19 pandemic is projected to lead to a significant degree of mental health crisis across the globe and therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO) had published brief messages/notes related to mental health and psychological considerations during COVID-19 outbreak and had highlighted the importance of psychological first aid.\nThe growing concern of the general public regarding the spread of infection from suspected COVID-19 positive individuals has created a panic mode in the community. While this will help in limiting the growing number of cases of COVID-19, this has also led to significant fear and anxiety related to spread of infection in the general public. Excessive fear and apprehension of spread of infection can lead to acute stress, anxiety, and subsyndromal to syndromal level of depression in vulnerable individuals. The National centre for Suicide Research and Prevention of Mental Ill-health (NASP) is already attempting to increase awareness about the potential increase in suicide and self-harm behavior as a result of the societal impact of the ongoing pandemic. Possible potential risk factors such as prolonged periods of social isolation, fear of unemployment, economic loss due to lockdown, death of family members and significant others etc. have been proposed to precipitate self-harm behaviors during this pandemic crisis There have been reports of suicide due to excessive fear of contracting COVID-19 from India as early as 12th February,2020, even when the infection was not spread across the country. Further, there have been isolated reports in the newspapers/bulletin of suicide due to alcohol ban during the lockdown period from different parts of India. Here we present two different presentations of self-harm attempts related to apprehension of developing COVID-19, who presented to our emergency medical services.\nCase Description: 1\nA 52 year old man, who was premorbidly well adjusted with no past and family history of mental illness presented to emergency with a gunshot injury. Exploration of history revealed that patient was doing well 3 weeks back, when he went to a social gathering, where he came in contact and interacted with one of his friend, who had recently returned from abroad. After 3-4 days, patient came to know that his friend had been diagnosed as COVID-19 positive. After learning this, he started worrying, that he might also have been infected and started remaining distressed and preoccupied with the thought of being infected with COVID-19. He was contact-traced by the healthcare authorities of his locality and was asked to be stay in self-isolation. He was asked to inform the health care workers if he develops any symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 infection (which was well-explained to him). He immediately isolated himself, because of fear of spreading the infection to his family members. Over the period next 2 weeks, while in isolation, gradually he developed depressive symptoms in the form of sadness of mood, anhedonia, lethargy, decreased appetite and decreased sleep. He kept on following the news of COVID-19 and learnt that it is leading to painful death. He would remain extremely anxious and would be preoccupied with the thought that he is going to die soon, became hopeless and considered himself to be worthless. He transferred all his property to his family members. After about 10-12 days of onset of the depressive symptoms, he started to have suicidal ideations more often and finally he shot himself with his gun in upper part of his left abdomen thinking that he is going to anyway die due to the COVID-19 infection. He shot himself to avoid painful death due to infection. There was no history of any cough, expectoration, running nose, fever and other depressive symptoms during this time. He was immediately brought to the trauma services of our hospital, operated (had only entry gunshot wound) and medically stabilized. Later he developed delirium due to medico-surgical complications and which was managed with Tab melatonin. He improved with melatonin over the next 24 hours was medically stabilized. A diagnosis of severe depression without psychotic symptoms was considered after clearing of delirium. Later he was planned for starting an antidepressant and supportive psychotherapeutic measures were started and continued.\nCase Description: 2\nA 40 years old male, was brought to emergency after a suicide attempt by hanging. Exploration of history revealed that around 1st week of March 2020, on one occasion while on his routine morning walk he was asked to take a photograph by a foreign couple. Later, patient came to know about the mode of transmission of COVID-19 infection. As a result, he started to remain distressed and worried that he could have contracted the infection from the foreigners. Following this over the period of next 2 weeks, despite having no respiratory symptoms, he started to remain sad, excessively worried about his health, and would express near his family members that he is going to die soon. He self-isolated himself from rest of his family members, would refuse food, stopped talking to his family members, developed somatic/bodily symptoms in the form of dryness of throat, pain abdomen, fatigue and attribute these symptoms to corona virus/COVID-19 infection. He kept on following the news about COVID-19, initially, learnt that it is associated with high mortality and the death is painful. Later, he started avoiding watching the news, because of increase in anxiety on listening about COVID-19 infection. He was not able to concentrate on his work. Because of fear of developing severe COVID-19 infection, he started to get thoughts that it is better to die by some means rather than waiting for the progression of COVID-19 infection and having a painful death. After about 2 weeks of onset of fear of developing COVID-19 infection, he attempted suicide by hanging himself with a rope. Within minutes of the attempt, he was found by the family members and was rescued, brought to emergency. He was medically stabilized. He was diagnosed with Adjustment Disorder Versus Severe Depressive Episode without psychotic symptoms. He was started on Cap fluoxetine 20 mg/day, which was increased to 40 mg/day after 1 week, along with low dose benzodiazepines (Clonazepam). He was also started on supportive psychotherapy. Within a week of starting of antidepressants and psychotherapeutic interventions he started to show improvement in his symptoms.\nDiscussion\nThese cases highlight the fact that how information overload can lead to increase in psychological distress among normal people too. One of the case developed severe anxiety and depression, after learning that the person with whom he came in contact with, was found to be COVID-19 positive and the second case developed anxiety and depressive symptoms, due to apprehension of possible infection, after coming in contact with people with travel history. While the first case had a direct contact with a COVID-19 positive case, the second subject had merely met a foreign couple. In both the cases, the depression and anxiety were fueled by the information overload in the media, with respect to COVID-19. Media reports have been highlighting the possible painful deaths and significant higher mortality with COVID-19 infection. Both the scenarios, depict that both the suicidal attempts could have been prevented, if proper awareness about the infection is done, by providing the necessary information about spread of infection, rather than talking about mortality rates and type of death.\nThe media (social media platforms, newspapers, radio/telecommunication services) on one hand are providing adequate information about safety measures to control the infection, but on the other hand, excessive description of COVID-19 related news in all social media platforms/ telecommunication platforms is creating a sense of panic among the vulnerable individuals. Therefore, there is a need for the media houses to judiciously transmit the information about the infection, to avoid scare and panic in people. However, this in no way means that they should not increase the awareness about the infection. Mental health professions should also advice people for judicious and cautious use of social media/telecommunication services. Further, in all patients coming to the medical-surgical or psychiatric setting with self-harm, anxiety and fear related to COVID-19 must be routinely enquired.\nDeclaration of Competing Interest\nNone.\nFinancial Disclosure\nNone.\nReferences\nFear of COVID 2019: First suicidal case in India\n","References depth 1":[{"doi":"10.1016/j.ajp.2020.101989","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Fear of COVID 2019: First suicidal case in India !","abstract":"","id":"PMC7130010","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier B.V.","authors":[{"firstname":"Kapil","surname":"Goyal","email":"kapilgoyalpgi@gmail.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Poonam","surname":"Chauhan","email":"chauhan.poonamk@gmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Komal","surname":"Chhikara","email":"dimpichhikara@gmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Parakriti","surname":"Gupta","email":"parakritii@gmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mini P.","surname":"Singh","email":"minipsingh@gmail.com","contributions":"1"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Coronavirus: Indian man' died by suicide' after becoming convinced he was infected. https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/coronavirus-indian-man-died-suicide-becoming-convinced-infected/ (Accessed 14 Feb 2020).","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Fearing he had contracted coronavirus, man locks family, kills himself. https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-suffering-from-cold-and-fever-commits-suicide-in-andhra-pradesh-feared-he-had-contracted-coronavirus-says-family/story-nECI2mhrvB5FiX2vHruFcK.html (Accessed 14 Feb 2020).","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Human Coronavirus Types. https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/types.html (Accessed 14 Feb 2020).","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"India's Internet shutdown in Kashmir is the longest ever in a democracy. https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/indias-internet-shutdown-in-kashmir-is-now-the-longest-ever-in-a-democracy/2019/12/15/bb0693ea-1dfc-11ea-977a-15a6710ed6da_story.html (Accessed 14 Feb 2020).","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Key considerations for repatriation and quarantine of travellers in relation to the outbreak of novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV. https://www.who.int/ith/Repatriation_Quarantine_nCoV-key-considerations_HQ-final11Feb.pdf?ua=1 (Accessed 14 Feb 2020).","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]}]}]},{"doi":"10.1016/S1726-4901(09)70146-7","date":"2005-02-16","title":"Impact of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Outbreaks on the Use of Emergency Department Medical Resources","abstract":"Background\nThe impact of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 on the emergency department (ED) medical needs of adult patients has not been elucidated.\n\n The purpose of this study was to investigate the demographic and clinical characteristics of ED adult patients before, during and after the SARS epidemic in a SARS-dedicated hospital.\n\n\nMethods\nA retrospective, ED chart review was conducted, and demographic data were obtained from a computer database, for a total of 17,586 patients.\n\n Patient information, including age, gender, mode of arrival, triage category, time of visit, main diagnosis, use of ED services, and status after the ED visit, were collected and compared for pre-, early-, peak-, late-, and post-SARS epidemic stages.\n\n\nResults\nDemographic data demonstrated a significant decrease in patient attendances per day, with a mean reduction of 92.5 ± 8.3 patients (43.7 ± 3.9% reduction in rate;

The need for these studies is additionally supported by the high incidence of these viral infections, the high prevalence of mood disorders, and resilience of suicide epidemics.\nIntroduction\nMood disorders are expected to be the second leading cause of global disease burden by the year 2030. An estimated 20.9 million American adults (representing 9.5% of the population ages 18 and above) suffer from a mood disorder. In addition, the risk of attempting suicide is significantly higher in individuals with a diagnosis of a mood disorder. Past suicide attempts are the most important predictor of completed suicide. Epidemiologically, a highly replicated seasonal peak of suicide in spring, with a greater amplitude in individuals with a history of mood disorders, follows or overlaps with seasonal peaks in epidemics of upper respiratory viruses and related immune responses. The development of services to prevent suicide hinges on an understanding of the interplay of factors and agents involved in the pathogenesis of mood disorders and suicidal behavior.\nInterest in the potential link between common respiratory viruses and mood disorders dates far back as the late 19th century. For instance, in his Dictionary of Psychological Medicine, described 18 cases of post-influenza mania and depression-all admitted to the Bethlem Hospital in London. described a series of 37 cases of post-influenza depression in Kent, England. Influenza has also been reported to be associated with the onset of a manic episode in individuals with no previous history of mental illness. These case reports notwithstanding, there is still a need to systematically examine the possible relationship between neurotropic respiratory viruses, mood disorders and suicide attempts.\nCoronaviruses are negatively stranded RNA viruses which commonly cause respiratory infection in the United States. Coronaviruses may also be capable of replication within the central nervous system of some individuals, as evident by the presence of RNA in the brains of patients with multiple sclerosis. The recent development of assays for the measurement of antibodies to prevalent strains of coronaviruses allows for the study of coronavirus exposure and the linkage of this exposure to diseases. Most recently, coronavirus exposure has been implicated in neuropsychiatric diseases including recent onset of psychosis.\nIn an attempt to understand the mechanism by which influenza and coronaviruses could be associated with mood disorders, two pathophysiologic mechanisms worth considering are: (a) the viruses directly affect the brain, and/or (b) the immune response to the viruses affects the brain. Furthermore, one could speculate that the viruses or the immune response to the viruses may create a vulnerability to triggers of depression or suicide in some.\nIt is important to advance the knowledge and understanding of the potential association of neurotropic respiratory viruses with mood disorders considering the high prevalence and functional incapacitation due to mood disorders, and the very high incidence of respiratory infections. For instance, an estimated 5-20% of the US population suffers a new influenza virus infection annually. In this current study we evaluated associations between seropositivity for coronaviruses, influenza A and B viruses, and the following: (a) history of mood disorders, (b) having attempted suicide in the past, (c) uni- vs. bi-polarity and (d) presence of psychotic features in mood disorders. We hypothesized that seropositivity will be associated with a history of mood disorders and suicide attempts, as well as the presence of psychotic features during past or current episodes of mood disorders.\nMethods\nStudy participants\nThe sample included a total of 257 subjects (aged 18 to 65, 95 male, 162 female) for the present study. 39 (15.2%) of these subjects were healthy normal controls. These participants were previously recruited into two primary studies of environmental influences on exacerbation of mood disorders and suicidal behavior. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. The original studies and the amendment for the current analysis were approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the University of Maryland, Johns Hopkins University and the Sheppard Pratt Health System. All 257 subjects underwent the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Disorders (SCID). Patients had to meet criteria for major depressive or bipolar disorders and they were excluded if they met criteria for substance dependence, cognitive disorders, or primary psychotic disorders. Suicide attempts were recorded using the Columbia Suicide History Form.\nSerological analysis\nIgG class antibodies to influenza A virus H3N2, influenza B virus, and the NL63 strain of human coronaviruses were measured using previously described enzyme immunoassay procedures. Positivity was defined as the generation of a signal greater than that of a standard seropositive sample.\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was carried out using and all significance levels reported were two-sided with p  &lt; 0.05 considered statistically significant. Pearson's chi2 tests and one-way ANOVA were used to compare groups defined by prior suicide attempts, history of mood disorder without suicide attempt(s), and control. chi2 tests were used to evaluate relationships between seropositivity for influenza and coronaviruses and the history of mood disorders, suicide attempts, and the presence of psychotic symptoms during mood episodes. Logistic regression models, adjusted for age and gender, were developed to estimate odds ratios with confidence intervals comparing seropositive vs. seronegative subjects on being diagnosed with mood disorders, attempting suicide and experiencing psychotic symptoms.\nResults\nDemographic and viral seropositivity characteristics\nDemographic and viral seropositivity characteristics of the study groups (n = 257).\nCharacteristics	Normal controls (n = 39)	Major depression (n = 117)	Suicide attempted (n = 99)	p-valuea	 	Age, years (mean +- SD)	42.7 +- 11.0	43.4 +- 10.9	40.3 +- 9.8	0.10	 	Race white, n (%) vs. other	28 (71.8)	65 (54.6)	60 (60.6)	0.16	 	Gender male, n (%)	13 (33.3)	43 (36.1)	39 (39.4)	0.78	 	Influenza A positive, n (%)	25 (64.1)	102 (87.2)	79 (79.8)	0.006	 	Influenza B positive, n (%)	28 (71.8)	108 (92.3)	96 (97.0)	&lt; 0.0001	 	Coronavirus positive, n (%)	16 (41.0)	98 (86.7)	79 (79.8)	&lt; 0.0001	 	\nchi2 test for categorical variables, ANOVA for continuous variables.\n Table 1 . depicts demographic and viral seropositivity characteristics of the participants.

Logistic regression analysis revealed that in this population sample, the odds of having a history of mood disorder were increased with seropositivity for influenza A (OR = 1.71, CI 1.18 to 2.50), influenza B (OR = 2.65, CI 1.65 to 4.25) and coronaviruses (OR = 2.72, CI 1.88 to 3.94) (Table 3 ).\nHowever the presence of antibodies to these viruses was not associated with the polarity of the mood disorder, i.e. unipolar vs. bipolar (influenza A, p  = 0.30, influenza B, p  = 0.60, coronaviruses, p  = 0.80).\nSeropositivity and suicide attempt\nAmong individuals with a history of mood disorder, seropositivity for influenza B was significantly associated with a history of suicide attempt(s) (p  =0.001) (Table 2), and the odds of having attempted suicide were increased in influenza B seropositive individuals (OR = 2.53, CI 1.33 to 4.80) (Table 3). There was no evidence of an association between seropositivity for influenza A or coronaviruses and a history of suicide attempt(s) (p  = 0.77, p  = 0.21).\nSeropositivity and psychotic symptomatology\nIn addition, seropositivity for influenza B was significantly associated with the presence of a history of psychotic symptoms in mood disorder patients (p  =0.005) (Table 2). The odds of experiencing psychotic symptoms during mood episodes were increased (OR = 2.63, CI 1.23 to 5.64) in influenza B seropositive individuals compared to those that were seronegative. There was no evidence of an association between seropositivity for influenza A or coronaviruses and a history of psychotic symptoms (p  = 0.94, p  = 0.41) (Table 2).\nDiscussion\nOur study adds to the sparse literature on the association of respiratory neurotropic viruses with mood disorders, and is to our knowledge, the first one to investigate the possible connection between these viruses and suicidal behavior. We confirmed our hypothesis that seropositivity for any of the three respiratory viruses was associated with a history of a mood disorder. However, only influenza B was associated with a history of suicide attempt as well as a lifetime history of psychotic symptoms in patients with mood disorders.\nBoth influenza and coronaviruses are RNA viruses. The three known types of influenza viruses are designated A, B and C. Types A and B are able to cause an epidemic outbreak while type C only causes mild illness in immunocompetent individuals. It has been estimated that up to 20% of children and 5% of adults worldwide experience symptomatic influenza infection annually. Until recently, coronavirus infection mainly presented as the &quot;common cold&quot; and usually had no long term sequelae. However, since 2002, cases have been reported of a severe atypical pneumonia (severe acute respiratory syndrome) due to a novel coronavirus.\nThe immune response to influenza and coronaviruses involves cell-mediated immunity, antibody-mediated immunity, local production of antibodies, interferon and other host defenses. In addition, systemic symptoms are felt to be related to the production of cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin 6 and 8, and interferon-alpha.\nAt the pathogen-immune system-brain interface, it is important to understand the similarities and differences between sickness behavior and clinical depression. Symptoms such as fatigue, sleep disturbance, appetite disturbance, decreased social interaction and loss of interest in usual activities are seen in both clinical depression and sickness behavior related to viral infections. Clinically, however, the core psychological symptoms of depression (hopelessness, worthlessness, pessimism and guilt) would be more typical of depression than sickness alone.\nIt is not clear whether the viruses themselves or the immune response to them are the main culprit in potentially leading to mood disorders. In addition to the pathogen-immune-depression connection, it is useful to conceptualize viral infection (with the resulting immune activation) as a form of stress. Some evidence suggests that inappropriate regulation of stress may be involved in the pathogenesis of depressive illness. Furthermore, the dysregulation of stress linked to the pathogenesis of depressive illness most likely results from a dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. An activated HPA axis has also been implicated in individuals who committed suicide-a finding that seems to be further corroborated by the observation of hyperplastic adrenals in suicide victims. Of interest is the fact that interleukins 1 and 6, and TNF-alpha (cytokines involved in the immune response against influenza) enhance HPA activation. Interferon-alpha is also involved in the immune response and a well recognized side effect of this cytokine is the induction of depressive disorder.\nCytokines have also been reported to cause a depletion of tryptophan (a precursor amino acid for serotonin synthesis). They stimulate indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) which converts tryptophan to kynurenine making tryptophan unavailable for serotonin synthesis. There is evidence that reduced tryptophan, and ultimately serotonin, play a role in the pathogenesis of depressive disorders.\nIn exploring the possibility that the viruses could have directly affected the brain to induce a mood disorder, it is worthy to note the fact that both influenza and coronaviruses are potentially neurotropic and have been isolated from the central nervous system. postulated that direct invasion of the brain (the locus ceruleus) by the influenza virus could have resulted in a manic episode in a 44-year old physician presented in his case report. The study by demonstrated that the M-protein of influenza exerted a depressive effect on the behavior of experimental animals, the effect being observed after a latent period. The authors proposed that the latent period could be the time taken for M-protein to cross the blood-brain barrier. However, both respiratory viruses as well as molecular and cellular mediators of inflammation may take a privileged naso-cortical path that bypasses the blood brain barrier.\nStudy of cases of influenza encephalitis revealed very little evidence that the neurological complications of influenza are due to the direct effects of the virus; the evidence supports mediation by immune responses. Perivascular demyelination observed in fatal cases also supports this view. Furthermore, if mood symptoms are due to direct effects of the viruses on the brain, then one would expect that a significant proportion of mood disorder patients would have experienced some symptoms of encephalopathy during the acute CNS invasion phase. This does not appear to be the case in this sample. However, it could be that the individuals with mood disorders were already predisposed, and the presence of the viruses or the immune reaction to them, triggered the mood disorder.\nWe measured antibodies to the NL63 strain of coronaviruses, which is most commonly associated with respiratory symptoms. A recent serological study documented an increased level of antibodies to this strain of coronaviruses in individuals with the recent onset of psychosis. This strain also shows substantial cross-reaction with other strains of coronaviruses which can infect the respiratory tract and the central nervous system. It is of note that in the present study a strong association was found with influenza B virus, which has also been associated with decreased cognitive functioning following fetal exposure as well as viral encephalopathy in children.\nLimitations\nOur study has a number of limitations that would have to be better addressed in future projects. The first limitation relates to the cross sectional nature of the study. Data collection was carried out at one time point and therefore it is not clear whether influenza or coronavirus infection occurred before, after, or during the onset of the depressive episodes. Consequently, the direction of causality cannot be inferred. Second, possible mediators and confounders such as socioeconomic factors, inflammatory markers, and patients' axis II psychopathology were not assessed. For participants with history of mood disorder, the number of depressive episodes, hospitalizations, age of onset, presence of rapid cycling, comorbid bulimia and cyclothymic temperament were not assessed. In addition, the relatively small sample size makes adjustment for all these potential confounders impractical.\nThe implications\nIf the findings from our study are replicated and an infection-to-mood rather than mood-to-infection causality direction is estimated in future longitudinal studies, a more aggressive prevention and treatment of neurotropic respiratory viruses might be advocated for patients with mood disorders. In addition, individuals with identifiable risk factors for suicidal behavior recovering from these viral infections might have to be monitored more closely. The threshold for intervention (pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic) following the appearance of symptoms of depressive disorder might also be lower for such individuals. The possibility of the use of prophylactic antidepressant medication for a brief time (as in), or an increase in the standing dose of antidepressants in treated patients at risk might represent a possible logical aim for a future clinical study. Finally, studies designed to elucidate the underlying biological mechanisms of the association between the viruses and mood disorders could lead to the discovery of new treatment targets and agents.\nIn conclusion, our results suggest an association between seropositivity for influenza and coronaviruses, and a history of mood disorders. In addition, seropositivity for influenza B was associated with suicidal behavior and psychotic features. Replicating our results in larger samples with longitudinal follow-ups may have potential public health relevance, especially in the context of the ongoing flu pandemic.\nRole of funding source\nFunding for this study was provided  to T.T.P.), NIH (grants R21 MH075891 and R01MH074891 PI TTP),  (PI TTP) and the  (to F.B.D. and R.H.Y.). The study sponsors had no further role in study design; in the collection, analysis and interpretation of data; in the writing of the report; and in the decision to submit the paper for publication.\nConflict of interest\nAll authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest with the publication of this paper.\nReferences\nThe role of corticotropin-releasing factor in depression and anxiety disorders\nNeuroinvasion by human respiratory coronaviruses\nSuicidal behavior in a French Cohort of major depressive patients: characteristics of attempters and nonattempters\nPrevalence and comorbidity of mental disorders in persons making serious suicide attempts: a case-control study\nImmunoregulatory feedback between interleukin-1 and glucocorticoid hormones\nCytokines as modulators of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis\nInterferon-alpha-induced changes in tryptophan metabolism: relationship to depression and paroxetine treatment\nDoes cytokine-induced depression differ from idiopathic major depression in medically healthy individuals?\nCytokine-induced sickness behavior: where do we stand?\nFrom inflammation to sickness and depression: when the immune system subjugates the brain\nCoronaviruses in brain tissue from patients with multiple sclerosis\nAn exploratory approach to the serotonergic hypothesis of depression: bridging the synaptic gap\nCognitive functioning prior to the onset of psychosis: the role of fetal exposure to serologically determined influenza infection\nPCR on cerebrospinal fluid to show influenza-associated acute encephalopathy or encephalitis\nCorticotropin releasing hormone in the pathophysiology of melancholic and atypical depression and in the mechanism of action of antidepressant drugs\nPost-influenzal depression\nDeterminants and outcomes of serious attempted suicide: a nationwide study in Finland, 1996-2003\nExpression of corticotropin releasing hormone receptors type I and type II mRNA in suicide victims and controls\nThe widening scope of coronaviruses\nPrevalence, severity, and comorbidity of twelve-month DSM-IV disorders in the National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R)\nThe role of inflammatory mediators in the biology of major depression: central nervous system cytokines modulate the biological substrate of depressive symptoms, regulate stress-responsive systems, and contribute to neurotoxicity and neuroprotection\nMeasuring the global burden of disease and epidemiological transitions: 2002-2030\nNeurobiology of suicidal behaviour\nBrain-immune interactions and disease susceptibility\nReversible splenial lesion in influenza virus encephalopathy\nInfluenza and mania: a possible connection with the locus ceruleus\nInfluenza B virus encephalitis\nHost-pathogen interactions during coronavirus infection of primary alveolar-epithelial cells\nInfluenza\nSeasonal spring peaks of suicide in victims with and without prior history of hospitalization for mood disorders\nSAS [computer program].
