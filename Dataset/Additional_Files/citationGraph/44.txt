The clinical data in other centers is limited. This study aims to explore the feasible parameters which could be used in clinical practice to predict the prognosis in hospitalized patients with severe coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19).\nMethods: In this case-control study, patients with severe COVID-19 in this newly established isolation center on admission between 27 January 2020 to 19 March 2020 were divided to discharge group and death event group. Clinical information was collected and analyzed for the following objectives: 1. Comparisons of basic characteristics between two groups; 2. Risk factors for death on admission using logistic regression; 3. Dynamic changes of radiographic and laboratory parameters between two groups in the course.\nResults: 124 patients with severe COVID-19 on admission were included and divided into discharge group (n=35) and death event group (n=89). Sex, SpO2, breath rate, diastolic pressure, neutrophil, lymphocyte, C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and D-dimer were significantly correlated with death events identified using bivariate logistic regression. Further multivariate logistic regression demonstrated a significant model fitting with C-index of 0.845 (p&lt;0.001), in which SpO2&lt;=89%, lymphocyte&lt;=0.64x109/L, CRP&gt;77.35mg/L, PCT&gt;0.20mug/L, and LDH&gt;481U/L were the independent risk factors with the ORs of 2.959, 4.015, 2.852, 3.554, and 3.185, respectively (p&lt;0.04). In the course, persistently lower lymphocyte with higher levels of CRP, PCT, IL-6, neutrophil, LDH, D-dimer, cardiac troponin I (cTnI), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and increased CD4+/CD8+ T-lymphocyte ratio and were observed in death events group, while these parameters stayed stable or improved in discharge group.\nConclusions: On admission, the levels of SpO2, lymphocyte, CRP, PCT, and LDH could predict the prognosis of severe COVID-19 patients. Systematic inflammation with induced cardiac dysfunction was likely a primary reason for death events in severe COVID-19 except for acute respiratory distress syndrome.\nIntroduction\nSince the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, it spread rapidly worldwide with a severity spectrum from asymptomatic to critical illness with the overall rate of approximately 3%. Up to date, an increasing number of more than forty-thousand fatalities were reported. Owing to the genomic homologies of the pathogen from the coronaviruses causing the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), COVID-19 presented a similar clinical course and pathological feature. Although most of the COVID-19 patients were mild who could gradually recover after two weeks, about 15-20% of patients developed severe interstitial pneumonia. Patients with severe illness usually developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that requires invasive mechanical ventilation therapy in the intensive care unit (ICU), and the mortality rate was reported around 50-60%.\nTo date, the clinical studies revealed different clinical and laboratory features between survivors and non-survivors, or between the non-severe and severe patients, and some prognostic risk factors were preliminarily discovered, such as age and D-dimer. However, most of these results were from or involving the same center in Wuhan, China, at a similar period, leading to potential selection bias. Moreover, the same patients in different articles were suspected. This study systematically analyzed the clinical features, laboratory investigations, and radiographic estimation in a temporary isolation center in Wuhan, China, established specially for severe COVID-19 patients by an emergency directive of the Wuhan Anti-epidemic Headquarters since 27 January 2020. All severe patients had to fulfill the WHO criteria for admission to hospital for a respiratory illness, which was slightly modified and adopted by both the WHO and the Chinese National Diagnosis and Treatment Protocols to define a severe case of COVID-19. These criteria defined severe COVID-19 as fever and/or respiratory infection with positive COVID-19 nucleic acid detection, plus one of the following: respiratory rate &gt; 30 breaths/min; severe respiratory distress; or SpO2 &lt;= 93% on room air. This study examined the factors associated with mortality in patients who fulfilled these criteria of severity at the time of hospital admission. It excluded patients who at the time of admission had, according to WHO criteria, mild illness, pneumonia, or had already progressed to ARDS, sepsis, or septic shock. For further speculation, it tried to explore the fatal course of COVID-19.\nMethods\nThis study was approved by the Ethics of Committees of Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology (No. 2020-0026), and followed the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards. Only the anonymous data was collected and informed consent for this retrospective study was waived.\nPatients\nThe consecutive admission records were reviewed retrospectively for the period from 27 January 2020 to 19 March 2020 in this provisional center (Western Campus, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology). Clinical data, including initial symptoms, past medical history, hospitalization date, treatment, and hematological and biochemical blood test results were obtained directly through the institutional electronic patient database. The inclusion criteria included: 1. Confirmed severe COVID-19 on admission as mentioned above; 2. No comorbidities which might impair the immune function, such as autoimmune disease, hematological malignancies, recent chemotherapy, etc.; 3. With definite discharge or COVID-19 related death outcome.\nImaging Estimation\nRegular bedside chest digital radiographs (DRs) were regularly performed every 1 to 3 days instead of conventional computed tomography (CT) scans after admission owing to the risk during the transfer of severe patients. A conventional semi-quantitative scoring system for DR was used to evaluate the pulmonary involvement area of the abnormalities including air-space and reticular opacities. Each lung was divided into three equidistant zones (upper, middle, and lower), resulting in a total of six zones to be scored. Each zone was visually scored from 0 to 4 as: score 0, 0% involvement; score 1, 1%-25% involvement; score 2, 26%-50% involvement; score 3, 51-75% involvement; and score 4, &gt;=76% involvement. The DR score was the sum of the score of each zone. The analysis was performed by two radiologists (CZ and LY, who had 26 and 22 years of experience in thoracic radiology, respectively) and the decisions were reached in consensus. All radiologists were blinded to the clinical progress of the patients to avoid information bias.\nGroups and Study Goals\nTwo groups were divided based on the clinical outcomes: discharge group and death event group. Three objectives were explored in this study: 1. Comparisons of basic characteristics between two groups, including the occurrence of ARDS, which was defined as worsening respiratory symptoms with PaO2/FiO2&lt;=300 mmHg based on the Berlin definition and WHO criteria; 2. Risk factors for death on admission; 3. Dynamic changes in DR scores and laboratory investigations between two groups in the follow-up.\nStatistical Analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics Software (version 24; IBM, New York, USA). Quantitative data were presented as median with inter-quartile range (IQR) and counting data were presented as the percentage of the total unless otherwise specified. The comparisons of the quantitative data were statistically evaluated using the Mann-Whitney U test, according to the non-normal distribution assessed by the Shapiro-Wilk test. The quantitative parameters were stratified into binary variables with the cutoffs of median values. The comparisons of counting data were evaluated using the Chi-square test. The bivariate and multivariate logistic regressions were used to investigate the risk factors for death events involving the stratified clinical, radiographic, and laboratory parameters with significant differences between two groups on admission, and the odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (95%CI) were calculated. Variables were excluded in the multivariate logistic regression if: 1. The univariate analysis demonstrated no statistical significance (p&lt;0.05); 2. The multivariate analysis demonstrated the probability of p&gt;=0.10 when using forward-LR method; 3. Variable had obvious colinearity with other variables resulting in variance inflation factor (VIF) of more than 5. C-index of predicted probability calculated using the optimal multivariate logistic model was evaluated by ROC curve estimation. A p-value of &lt;0.05 was defined as the statistical significance.\nResults\nBasic characteristics and comparisons between two groups\nAfter retrieving the electronic records, 124 patients were eventually included in the further analysis from 211 consecutive records (Figure 1). The basic information of included patients was summarized in Table 1. The median age of patients was 68 yrs (IQR 61-75 yrs), and 68.5% of patients were male. Half of the patients had hypertension history and 11 patients had COPD (GOLD II grade) history which was controlled well after quitting smoking and ipratropium treatment. Fever and cough were the most common initial symptoms (85.5% and 69.4%, respectively). The median interval between the admission and symptom onset was 11 days (IQR 7-15 days). On admission, the median body temperature on admission reached 38.3  C (IQR: 37.0-39.0 C). The median breath rate was 30/min (IQR: 23-33/min) and median SpO2 was 89% (IQR: 82-92%). In most patients (123/124, 99.2%), DRs demonstrated bilateral opacities with the median DR score of 13 (IQR: 7-16). Multiple abnormities of biochemical and hematological parameters were observed as well, including neutrophil, lymphocyte, C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer, cardiac troponin I (cTnI), and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and so on. In the course, 91 patients (73.4%) aggravated to ARDS with the median period of 7 days after admission (IQR 4-11 days), who were transferred to ICU afterwards. Eventually, 89 patients (71.8%) with ARDS complications died who were included in death event group, while 35 patients (28.2%) were recovered and discharged who were included in discharge group.\nCompared between the two groups, the patients in death event group had significantly higher male proportion (75.3% vs. 51.4%), lower SpO2 (85% vs. 90%), and higher breath rate (30 vs 25/min) (Table 2). In the course, ARDS was more predominantly occurred in death event group compared with discharge group (89 vs. 2). 10 patients with ARDS in death event group refused endotracheal intubation. The median survival period in death event group was 15 days (IQR 9-22 days), while the median hospitalized period in discharge group was 29 days (IQR 23-35 days) (Table 2). On admission, the bedside DRs showed larger pulmonary opacities in death event group compared with discharge group, but without a significant difference (14 vs. 11, p=0.289) (Table 2). Besides, more abnormities of biochemical and hematological parameters were observed in death event group compared with discharge group, such as neutrophil, lymphocyte, CRP, PCT, LDH, D-dimer, cTnI, and BNP (Table 2).\nRisk factor estimation of death events\nThe bivariate logistic regression was performed on the clinical, radiographic, and laboratory parameters (Table 3). As a result, ten stratified parameters including male sex, SpO2&lt;=89%, breath rate&gt;30/min, diastolic pressure&lt;=80mmHg, neutrophil&gt;6.46x109/L, lymphocyte&lt;=0.64x109/L, CRP&gt;77.35mg/L, PCT&gt;0.20mug/L, LDH&gt;481U/L, and D-dimer&gt;3.06mg/L showed significant risks with death events (Table 3). No obvious multicollinearity was observed with the variance inflation factor (VIF) value of less than 1.6 in each involved variable (Table S1). Further multivariate logistic regression showed a significant model fitting involving stratified SpO2, lymphocyte, CRP, PCT, and LDH. The results demonstrated that SpO2&lt;=89%, lymphocyte&lt;=0.64x109/L, CRP&gt;77.35mg/L, PCT&gt;0.20mug/L, and LDH&gt;481U/L were the independent risk factors with the ORs of 2.959, 4.015, 2.852, 3.554, and 3.185, respectively (p&lt;0.04). The C-index of the predicted probability calculated using this multivariate logistic model was 0.845 (p&lt;0.001) (Figure 2).\nDynamic changes in laboratory investigations and DR scores between patients with clinical stability and death events\nIn the course, DR scores increased in death event group with a significant difference between the two groups after 1 to 3 days from admission (Figure 3 and 4). After 15 days, DR scores slowly declined in discharge group while increasing in death event group (Figure 3 and 4). In death event group, the neutrophil gradually increased to more than 10.00x109/L, and lymphocyte stayed at the lower level from 0.47 to 0.56x109/L in the course, with significant differences from discharge group (Figure 4). In discharge group, lymphocyte gradually increased from 0.88x109/L to normal level (&gt;=1.1 x109/L) after nine days. Besides, it demonstrated the significantly higher levels of CRP, PCT, LDH, and D-dimer in death event group, which gradually decreased or stayed at the relatively lower levels in discharge group (Figure 4). cTnI and BNP demonstrated dramatic fluctuation with significantly higher levels at some time points in death event group compared with discharge group (Figure 4). No obvious abnormalities of total bilirubin (TB), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and serum creatinine (Scr) in the course were observed in both groups (Table S2).\nAmong all 124 patients, 77 patients underwent consecutive cytokine profile and lymphocyte subsets analysis in the course, including 29 patients in charge group and 48 patients in death event group. The levels of IL-2, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and INF-gamma didn't show significant differences between two groups and stayed in the normal reference ranges at most of time (Figure 5). Compared with discharge group, IL-6 was significantly elevated in death event group. And IL-10 was significantly increased after 29 days in death event group (Figure 5). CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T-lymphocyte ratio stayed in the normal range in both groups, though approaching the upper or lower reference at some time points (Figure 6). CD3+ and CD8+ T-lymphocyte ratios were significantly higher in discharge group at several time points, but the CD4+/CD8+ T-lymphocyte ratio seemed higher in death group compared with discharge group reaching significant difference at the time point of 17-19 days (Figure 6). The quantitative data were summarized in Table S3.\nDiscussion\nThis study reported the differences between the discharged and died patients with severe COVID-19 in the clinical course. On admission, SpO2&lt;=89%, lymphocyte&lt;=0.64x109/L, CRP&gt;77.35mg/L, PCT&gt;0.20mug/L, and LDH&gt;481U/L were the independent risk factors associated with death events. Besides, in the clinical course, significantly higher levels of DR score, neutrophil, IL-6, D-dimer, cTnI, and BNP were also observed in death event group. Thus, the results indicated that severe systematic inflammation with cardiac impairment played an important role in the fatal process of COVID-19.\nCorresponding to the previous reports, old patients with a median age of 68 yrs (IQR 61-75 yrs) presenting more coexisting illnesses such as hypertension and CVD were more likely to develop severe COVID-19. Male patients in this study were more inclined to occurred ARDS and death events, in agreement with a retrospective report with a cohort of 44,672 patients where male patients over 60 years of age with comorbidities had a higher death risk. In the course, patients in death event group showed a significantly higher ratio of ARDS than discharge group (100.0% vs. 5.7%). It indicated the survival rate was very low if the patients aggravated to this critical status and further exploration of the treatment to prevent ARDS is imperative. Although no significant difference in the period between initial symptom onset and admission was found between two groups, attention still should be paid to early diagnosis and treatment because the mean period of 11 days from symptom onset to admission in this study was probably too late when the severe progression had occurred.\nBecause the DR demonstrated a good consistency to chest CT which was also capable of estimating the COVID-19 in the follow-up, it was consecutively performed in this cohort in order to reduce the transferring risk of the severe patients and X-ray exposure. On admission, bilaterally diffuse pulmonary opacities in DRs were observed in most patients (99.5%), similar to the demonstrations in SARS and MERS. The higher DR scores in death event group on admission were presented with a lower SpO2 level and a higher breath rate when compared with discharge group, though no significant difference was revealed. However, more rapid progression of pulmonary opacities with a significantly higher DR score was observed afterwards in death event group. Different from no absorption in death event group, the pulmonary lesions were slowly absorbed after half a month from admission in discharge group. Due to the limited medical resources in this provisional center, lung ultrasound was not routinely performed. From the previous studies, lung ultrasound could also be performed at the bedside and has been used in diagnosing and monitoring pneumonia with higher sensitivity and specificity (&gt;=94%) than DR but without X-ray exposure. Thus, it might be a good alternative to conventional bedside DR in severe COVID-19 patients.\nUp to date, some previous studies already revealed multiple risk factors associated with poor prognosis, such as compromised respiratory status, older age, male sex, lymphocytopenia, high Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, and elevated levels of CRP, PCT, LDH, and D-dimer. However, these studies did not consider the impacts of the disease severities on admission in the analysis. As a complementary, this study provided a risk-factor analysis only in the population of severe COVID-19 who presented a higher mortality rate than moderate COVID-19. As a case-control study, the bivariate logistic regression returned with ten stratified risk factors for death with statistical significances, including male sex, SpO2&lt;=89%, breath rate&gt;30/min, diastolic pressure&lt;=80mmHg, neutrophil&gt;6.46x109/L, lymphocyte&lt;=0.64x109/L, CRP&gt;77.35mg/L, PCT&gt;0.20mug/L, LDH&gt;481U/L, and D-dimer&gt;3.06mg/L. Further multivariate logistic regression using the forward-LR method resulted in a significant fitting model with good discriminatory power (C-index=0.845). The results revealed SpO2&lt;=89%, lymphocyte&lt;=0.64x109/L, CRP&gt;77.35mg/L, PCT&gt;0.20mug/L, and LDH&gt;481U/L on admission were the independent risk factors, among which the lymphocyte&lt;=0.64x109/L demonstrated the highest OR of 4.015. Moreover, the abnormalities of lymphocyte, CRP, PCT, and LDH stayed or continuously aggravated in death event group but gradually recovered to normal levels in discharge group. Therefore, the dynamic monitoring of these laboratory parameters could estimate the prognosis in clinical practice for severe patients.\nIn further analysis of the lymphocyte subsets in limited groups, no obvious abnormalities of CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T-lymphocyte ratio were found in both groups. However, relatively high CD4+/CD8+ T-lymphocyte ratio above or near the upper normal reference was observed in both groups, while it seemed higher in death event group. Therefore, it indicated no obvious impairment of the immune function, though lymphocyte reduced in severe COVID-19. As an evidence, a previous post-mortem autopsy study of COVID-19, it revealed reduced CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocyte in peripheral blood with overactivation of T-lymphocyte manifested by an increase of Th17 and high cytotoxicity of CD8+ T-lymphocytes. As a result, severe immune injury could occur in severe patients.\nTo date, no confirmed evidence of the viral attack on solid organs other than lung was observed in pathological analysis and autopsy. Two previous studies in the same center found significantly elevated levels of multiple serum cytokines in severe COVID-19 patients, such as IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and INF-gamma, which were associated with the disease severity. It was suspected a phenomenon named &quot;cytokine storm&quot; might result in the progression of the disease in viral pneumonia. In previous studies, COVID-19 was thought to induce &quot;cytokine storm&quot; that then caused multi-organ impairment involving the heart, liver, and kidney. However, the clinical course of our patients did not appear to follow this sequence of events. Among multiple cytokines, only IL-6 as one major proinflammatory factor significantly increased with time in death event group with the simultaneous increase of IL-10 as an anti-inflammatory factor, while IL-2, IL-4, TNF-alpha, and INF-gamma neither showed significant differences between two groups nor demonstrated obvious abnormalities in the course. Besides, the hepatic and renal related parameters were not significantly elevated. Therefore, the result of this study didn't support this fatal hypothesis of &quot;cytokine storm&quot; with induced multi-organ impairments in severe COVID-19. It was speculated that in those published studies, the dynamic changes of the related laboratory parameters were demonstrated as the mean value which might be not appropriate due to the non-normal distribution of the data. Thus, the dynamic demonstration with the median value was more reliable in this study.\nOn the other hand, CRP, PCT, IL-6, and BNP as the major indicators of inflammatory severity in intensive care medicine, had significantly increased or stayed at a relatively high level in death event group, corresponding to the aggravated sepsis in these patients which could cause life-threatening organ dysfunction. As indirect evidence, increased CD4+/CD8+ T-lymphocyte ratio in death group was also a typical abnormality in sepsis. Meanwhile, gradually increased neutrophil was observed indicating progressive inflammation as part of the inadequate host response to viral aggression. In summary, all of these abnormalities could be ascribed to severe systematic inflammation caused by COVID-19. More than this, the virus-induced inflammation could initiate the activation of the fibrinolytic system and fibrin catabolism resulting in the elevation of the D-dimer level in severe patients which was also observed in this study. As a complication, a persistently high level of LDH, cTnI, and BNP indicated potential cardiac impairment in the course like reported in other studies. However, the elevated levels of D-dimer, cTnI, and BNP fluctuated or decreased in the course but not persistently aggravated, while these parameters progressively deteriorated with time in non-survivors in previous studies. As speculation, these differences might be ascribed to more attention paid to the cardiac protection and microcirculation improvement for the patients in this cohort.\nIn brief, it was concluded that the systematic inflammation with induced cardiac dysfunction was the leading cause of death events in severe COVID-19 except for ARDS. Thus, the use of corticosteroids should still be considered for critical patients to prevent severe inflammatory response. In one recent study, it was found treatment with methylprednisolone significantly decreased death risk. Serum cytokine profiling and lymphocyte subsets analysis might be useful to guide the immunomodulatory treatment.\nThis case-controlled study has limitations. First, the sample size is limited in this study and not all patients underwent sequential cytokine profile and lymphocyte subsets tests. Second, the study was limited by the heterogeneity of treatments based on the disease status with time, which was impossible to summarize in this cohort. Thus, only the speculation was made to explain the fluctuation of some abnormal laboratory parameters in the course. Third, the dynamic changes of vital signs and oxygen saturation were not presented, because they were continuously monitored in the course and sort of affected by the adjusted treatments. At last, some important subsets of lymphocytes including Th17 and Treg were not measured due to the limitation of the laboratory techniques in this provisional isolation center, thus the identification of the immune function was not comprehensive.\nConclusions\nIn summary, this study revealed the clinical course of severe COVID-19 patients from admission with different outcomes. Dynamic monitoring of lymphocyte, CRP, PCT, and LDH could be meaningful to predict the prognosis of severe patients. Besides, the fatal feature of COVID-19 is mostly attributed to severe systematic inflammation with induced cardiac dysfunction except for ARDS.\nSupplementary Material\nAbbreviations\nCOVID-19\ncoronavirus disease-19\nSARS\nSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome\nMERS\nMiddle East Respiratory Syndrome\nARDS\nacute respiratory distress syndrome\nICU\nintensive care unit\nDR\ndigital radiograph\nCT\ncomputed tomography\nIQR\ninter-quartile range\nOR\nodds ratio\n95%CI\n95% confidence interval\nVIF\nvariance inflation factor\nCVD\ncardiovascular disease\nCOPD\nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease\nDR\ndigital radiograph\nWBC\nwhite blood cell count\nCRP\nC-reactive protein\nPCT\nprocalcitonin\nTB\ntotal bilirubin\nALT\nalanine aminotransferase\nAST\naspartate aminotransferase\nLDH\nlactate dehydrogenase\nScr\nserum creatinine\nAPTT\nactivated partial thromboplastin time\nPT\nprothrombin time\ncTnI\ncardiac troponin I\nBNP\nbrain natriuretic peptide\nThe epidemiological characteristics of an outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) in China\nNovel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)\nEpidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study\nNovel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)\nPathological findings of COVID-19 associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome\nClinical Characteristics of 138 Hospitalized Patients With 2019 Novel Coronavirus-Infected Pneumonia in Wuhan, China\nClinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China\nClinical Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China\nTime Course of Lung Changes On Chest CT During Recovery From 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pneumonia\nClinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study\nClinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study\nRisk Factors Associated With Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome and Death in Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pneumonia in Wuhan, China\nClinical predictors of mortality due to COVID-19 based on an analysis of data of 150 patients from Wuhan, China\nEditorial Concern-Possible Reporting of the Same Patients With COVID-19 in Different Reports\nDiagnosis and treatment protocols of pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus (trial version 6)\nDiagnosis and treatment protocols of pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus (trial version 7)\nClinical management of severe acute respiratory infection when novel coronavirus (nCoV) infection is suspected\nIMAI district clinician manual: hospital care adolescents and adults: guidelines for the management of illnessess with limited-resources\nRadiographic-clinical correlation in severe acute respiratory syndrome: study of 1373 patients in Hong Kong\nClinical implication of radiographic scores in acute Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus pneumonia: Report from a single tertiary-referral center of South Korea\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome: the Berlin Definition\nClinical management of severe acute respiratory infection when novel coronavirus (nCoV) infection is suspected: interim guidance\nVariance Inflation Factor: As a Condition for the Inclusion of Suppressor Variable(s) in Regression Analysis\nPortable chest X-ray in coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19): A pictorial review\nLung Ultrasound in the Diagnosis and Follow-up of Community-Acquired Pneumonia: A Prospective, Multicenter, Diagnostic Accuracy Study\nLung ultrasound for the diagnosis of pneumonia in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis\nA gross observational report of systematic autopsy in COVID-19 pneumonia\nEndothelial-platelet interactions in influenza-induced pneumonia: A potential therapeutic target\nPlasma inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in severe acute respiratory syndrome\n[Study on the levels of main inflammatory factors in septic shock and their clinical significance]\nThe Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3)\nCoincidence of pro- and anti-inflammatory responses in the early phase of severe sepsis: Longitudinal study of mononuclear histocompatibility leukocyte antigen-DR expression, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, and changes in T-cell subsets in septic and postoperative patients\nNeutrophil Activation During Septic Shock\nThe association between plasma D-dimer levels and community-acquired pneumonia\n[Analysis of clinical features of 29 patients with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia]\nFlowchart of inclusion of the patients.\n ROC curve of multivariate logistic regression.

coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7159299","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Zika virus disease, present a major threat to public health1–3.\n Despite intense research efforts, how, when and where new diseases appear are still a source of considerable uncertainty.\n A severe respiratory disease was recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like

coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.\n\n Increasing quartile of NLR was statistically significantly associated with secondary outcome.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR is associated with outcomes in unselected critically

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

Baseline and serial CXRs (total 255 CXRs) were reviewed along with RT-PCRs.\n\n Correlation with concurrent CTs (total 28 CTs) was made when available.\n\n Two radiologists scored each CXR in consensus for: consolidation, ground glass opacity (GGO), location and pleural fluid.\n\n A severity index was determined for each lung.\n\n The lung scores were summed to produce the final severity score.\n\n\nResults\nThere were 64 patients (26 men, mean age 56±19 years).\n\n Of these, 58, 44 and 38 patients had positive initial RT-PCR (91%, [CI: 81-96%]), abnormal baseline CXR (69%, [CI: 56-80%]) and positive initial RT-PCR with abnormal baseline CXR (59 [CI:46-71%]) respectively.\n\n Six patients (9%) showed CXR abnormalities before eventually testing positive on RT-PCR.\n\n Sensitivity of initial RT-PCR (91% [95% CI: 83-97%]) was higher than baseline CXR (69% [95% CI: 56-80%]) (p = 0.009).\n\n Radiographic (mean 6 ± 5 days) and virologic recovery (mean 8 ± 6 days) were not significantly different (p= 0.33).\n\n Consolidation was the most common finding (30/64, 47%), followed by GGO (21/64, 33%).\n\n CXR abnormalities had a peripheral (26/64, 41%) and lower zone distribution (32/64, 50%) with bilateral involvement (32/64, 50%).\n\n Pleural effusion was uncommon (2/64, 3%).\n\n The severity of CXR findings peaked at 10-12 days from the date of symptom onset.\n\n\nConclusion\nChest x-ray findings in COVID-19 patients frequently showed bilateral lower zone consolidation which peaked at 10-12 days from symptom onset.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7233401","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Radiological Society of North America","authors":[{"firstname":"Ho Yuen

We also conducted a trial sequential analysis to indicate the possibility of type I or II errors and calculate the information size.\n Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach (GRADE) was applying to assess the certainty of evidence at the primary outcome level.\n Results.\n Twenty-one RCTs were identified and analyzed.\n Patients treated with corticosteroid had a 7% reduction in relative risk in 28-day all-cause mortality compared to controls (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.88 to 0.99).\n However, there were no significant differences for the intensive care unit (ICU) mortality (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.09) or in-hospital mortality (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.11).\n Corticosteroids shortened the length of ICU stay by 1.04 days (RR -1.04, 95% CI -1.72 to -0.36) and the length of hospital stay by 2.49 days (RR -2.49, 95% CI -4.96 to -0.02).\n Corticosteroids increased the risk of hyperglycemia (RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.16) but not gastroduodenal bleeding (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.37) or superinfection (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.15).\n However, some date on secondary outcomes were unavailable because they were not measured or not reported in the included studies which may cause a lack of power or selective outcome reporting.\n The information size was calculated at 10044 patients.\n Trial sequential analysis showed that the meta-analysis was conclusive and the risk of type 2 error was minimal.\n What Is New and Conclusion.\n Corticosteroids are likely to be effective in reducing 28-day mortality and attenuating septic shock without increasing the rate of life-threatening complications.\n TSA showed that the risk of type II error in this meta-analysis was minimal and the result was conclusive.\n","id":"PMC6590573","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Hindawi","authors":[{"firstname":"X.-J.","surname":"Lian","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"D.-Z.","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Y.-S.","surname":"Cao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Y.-X.","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Z.-Z.","surname":"Lian","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"T.-H.","surname":"Qin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"P.-C.","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Y.-H.","surname":"Liu","email":"lyh0718@126.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"S.-H.","surname":"Wang","email":"wshdoctor@139.com","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"S.-H.","surname":"Wang","email":"wshdoctor@139.com","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.ajem.2018.11.040","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Can corticosteroids reduce the mortality of patients with severe sepsis?

clinical presentation, gene expression signatures that predict subsequent severity will allow clinicians to identify the most at-risk groups of patients and enable appropriate antibiotic use.\n\n\nMethods\nBlood RNA-Seq and clinical data were collected from 348 patients in four emergency rooms (ER) and one intensive-care-unit (ICU), and 44 healthy controls.\n\n Gene expression profiles were analyzed using machine learning and data mining to identify clinically relevant gene signatures reflecting disease severity, organ dysfunction, mortality, and specific endotypes/mechanisms.\n\n\nFindings\nGene expression signatures were obtained that predicted severity/organ dysfunction and mortality in both ER and ICU patients with accuracy/AUC of 77–80%.\n\n Network analysis revealed these signatures formed a coherent biological program, with specific but overlapping mechanisms/pathways.\n\n Given the heterogeneity of sepsis, we asked if patients could be assorted into discrete groups with distinct mechanisms (endotypes) and varying severity.\n\n Patients with early sepsis could be stratified into five distinct and novel mechanistic endotypes, named Neutrophilic-Suppressive/NPS, Inflammatory/INF, Innate-Host-Defense/IHD, Interferon/IFN, and Adaptive/ADA, each based on ?200 unique gene expression differences, and distinct pathways/mechanisms (e.\n\ng.\n\n, IL6/STAT3 in NPS).\n\n Endotypes had varying overall severity with two severe (NPS/INF) and one relatively benign (ADA) groupings, consistent with reanalysis of previous endotype studies.\n\n A 40 gene-classification tool (accuracy=96%) and several gene-pairs (accuracy=89–97%) accurately predicted endotype status in both ER and ICU validation cohorts.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe severity and endotype signatures indicate that distinct immune signatures precede the onset of severe sepsis and lethality, providing a method to triage early sepsis patients.\n\n\n","id":"PMC8808161","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier","authors":[{"firstname":"Arjun","surname":"Baghela","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Olga

Neutrophil Death","abstract":"id='P1'>Gasdermin D (GSDMD) is considered a proinflammatory factor that mediates pyroptosis in macrophages to protect hosts from intracellular bacteria.\n Here, we reveal that GSDMD deficiency paradoxically augmented host responses to extracellular Escherichia coli, mainly by delaying neutrophil death, which established GSDMD as a negative regulator of innate immunity.\n In contrast to its activation in macrophages, in which activated inflammatory caspases cleave GSDMD to produce an N-terminal fragment (GSDMD-cNT) to trigger pyroptosis, GSDMD cleavage and activation in neutrophils was caspase independent.\n It was mediated by a neutrophil-specific serine protease, neutrophil elastase (ELANE), released from cytoplasmic granules into the cytosol in aging

analysis","abstract":"Background\nCorrelation networks are increasingly being used in bioinformatics applications.\n\n For example, weighted gene co-expression network analysis is a systems biology method for describing the correlation patterns among genes across microarray samples.\n\n Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) can be used for finding clusters (modules) of highly correlated genes, for summarizing such clusters using the module eigengene or an intramodular hub gene, for relating modules to one another and to external sample traits (using eigengene network methodology), and for calculating module membership measures.\n\n Correlation networks facilitate network based gene screening methods that can be used to identify candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets.\n\n These methods have been successfully applied in various biological contexts, e.\n\ng.\n\n cancer, mouse genetics, yeast genetics, and analysis of brain imaging data.\n\n While parts of the correlation network methodology have been described in separate publications, there is a need to provide a user-friendly, comprehensive, and consistent software implementation and an accompanying tutorial.\n\n\nResults\nThe WGCNA R software package is a comprehensive collection of R functions for performing various aspects of weighted correlation network analysis.\n\n The package includes functions for network construction, module detection, gene selection, calculations of topological properties, data simulation, visualization, and interfacing with external software.\n\n Along with the R package we also present R software tutorials.\n\n While the methods development was motivated by gene expression data, the underlying data mining approach can be applied to a variety of different

translated into daily clinical practice in septic shock patients.\n\n Perfusion markers are surrogates of deeper physiological phenomena.\n\n Lactate-to-pyruvate ratio (LPR) and the ratio between veno-arterial PCO2 difference and Ca–vO2 (?PCO2/Ca–vO2) have been proposed as markers of tissue hypoxia, but they have not been compared in the clinical scenario.\n\n We studied acute septic shock patients under resuscitation.\n\n We wanted to evaluate the relationship of these hypoxia markers with clinical and biochemical markers of hypoperfusion during septic shock resuscitation.\n\n\nMethods\nSecondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial.\n\n Septic shock patients were randomized to fluid resuscitation directed to normalization of capillary refill time (CRT) versus normalization or significant lowering of lactate.\n\n Multimodal assessment of perfusion was performed at 0, 2, 6 and 24 hours, and included macrohemodynamic and metabolic perfusion variables, CRT, regional flow and hypoxia markers.\n\n Patients who attained their pre-specified endpoint at 2-hours were compared to those who did not.\n\n\nResults\nForty-two patients were recruited, median APACHE-II score was 23 [15–31] and 28-day mortality 23%.\n\n LPR and ?PCO2/Ca–vO2 ratio did not correlate during early resuscitation (0–2 h) and the whole study period

allocation of resources, and clinical treatment initiatives.\n\n We estimated the global, regional, and national incidence of sepsis and mortality from this disorder using data from GBD 2017.\nMethods\nWe used multiple cause-of-death data from 109 million individual death records to calculate mortality related to sepsis among each of the 282 underlying causes of death in GBD 2017. The percentage of sepsis-related deaths by underlying GBD cause in each location worldwide was modelled using mixed-effects linear regression.\n\n Sepsis-related mortality for each age group, sex, location, GBD cause, and year (1990–2017) was estimated by applying modelled cause-specific fractions to GBD 2017 cause-of-death estimates.\n\n We used data for 8·7 million individual hospital records to calculate in-hospital sepsis-associated case-fatality, stratified by underlying GBD cause.\n\n In-hospital sepsis-associated case-fatality was modelled for each location using linear regression, and sepsis incidence was estimated by applying modelled case-fatality to sepsis-related mortality estimates.\n\n\nFindings\nIn 2017, an estimated 48·9 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 38·9–62·9) incident cases of sepsis were recorded worldwide and 11·0 million (10·1–12·0) sepsis-related deaths were reported, representing 19·7% (18·2–21·4) of all global deaths.\n\n Age-standardised sepsis incidence fell by 37·0% (95% UI 11·8–54·5) and mortality decreased by 52·8% (47·7–57·5) from 1990 to 2017.

well-studied marker for predicting treatment response and mortality in sepsis, it was aimed to assess the efficacy of the neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR) as a predictor of mortality and treatment response in sepsis patients in the intensive care unit (ICU).\n\n\nMaterials and methods\nIn this retrospective cross-sectional study, sepsis patients were divided according to the presence of septic shock on the 1st day of ICU stay, and then subgrouped according to mortality.\n\n Patient demographics, acute physiologic and chronic health evaluation II and sequential organ failure assessment scores, NLR and CRP (on the 1st, 3rd, and last day in the ICU), microbiology data, antibiotic responses, ICU data, and mortality were recorded.\n\n Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for the area under curve (AUC) were calculated for the inflammatory markers and ICU severity scores for mortality.\n\n\nResults\nOf the 591 (65% male) enrolled patients, 111 (18.8%) were nonsurvivors with shock, 117 (19.8%) were survivors with shock, 330 (55.8%) were survivors without shock, and 33 (5.6%) were nonsurvivors without shock.\n\n On the 1st day of ICU stay, the NLR and CRP were similar in all of the groups.\n\n On the 3rd day of antibiotic response, the NLR was increased (11.8) in the nonresponsive patients when compared with the partially responsive (11.0) and responsive (8.5) patients.\n\n If the NLR was ?15 on the 3rd day, the mortality odds ratio was 6.96 (CI: 1.4–34.1, P &lt; 0.017).\n\n The NLR and CRP on the 1st, 3rd, and last day of ICU stay (0.52, 0.58, 0.78 and 0.56, 0.70, 0.78, respectively) showed a similar increasing trend for mortality.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR can predict mortality and antibiotic responsiveness in ICU patients with sepsis and septic shock.\n\n If the NLR is &gt;15 on the 3rd day of postantibiotic initiation, the risk of mortality is high and treatment should be reviewed

admission associated with COVID-19 mortality in hospitalized patients: A retrospective observational study\nBackground\nTo identify and quantify associations between baseline characteristics on hospital admission and mortality in patients with COVID-19 at a tertiary hospital in Spain.\nMethods and findings\nThis retrospective case series included 238 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 at Hospital Universitario Clinico San Cecilio (Granada, Spain) who were discharged or who died. Electronic medical records were reviewed to obtain information on sex, age, personal antecedents, clinical features, findings on physical examination, and laboratory results for each patient. Associations between mortality and baseline characteristics were estimated as hazard ratios (HR) calculated with Cox regression models.\nSeries mortality was 25.6%. Among patients with dependence for basic activities of daily living, 78.7% died, and among patients residing in retirement homes, 80.8% died. The variables most clearly associated with a greater hazard of death were age (3% HR increase per 1-year increase in age; 95%CI 1-6), diabetes mellitus (HR 2.42, 95%CI 1.43-4.09), SatO2/FiO2 ratio (43% HR reduction per 1-point increase; 95%CI 23-57), SOFA score (19% HR increase per 1-point increase, 95%CI 5-34) and CURB-65 score (76% HR increase per 1-point increase, 95%CI 23-143).\nConclusions\nThe patients residing in retirement homes showed great vulnerability. The main baseline factors that were independently associated with mortality in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 were older age, diabetes mellitus, low SatO2/FiO2 ratio, and high SOFA and CURB-65 scores.\nIntroduction\nSince 11 March 2020, when the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a worldwide SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, there have been more than 213,000 confirmed cases in Spain (as of 25 April 2020) and 22,157 deaths, representing a mortality rate of 47 per 100,000 inhabitants. Different reports on the status of the COVID-19 epidemic published in Spain by the Ministry of Health indicate that this disease is slightly more prevalent in women, in people older than 50 years, and in people with two or more previous illnesses, particularly hypertension (HT) (47.4%), cardiovascular disease (CVD) (32.3%), and diabetes mellitus (DM) (16.1%).\nAmong confirmed cases of infection, 48.7% patients have required hospitalization mainly for pneumonia and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Among patients with pneumonia, men, people older than 60 years, and people with CVD and/or DM are overrepresented. Among Spanish patients the most frequent symptoms have been fever (75.7%), cough (75.5%) and dyspnoea (48.3%). In 5% of hospitalized patients, the clinical course progressed to critical status requiring admission to the intensive care unit, and 2.3% have died.\nRadiographic findings in patients with pneumonia are highly variable depending on-among other factors-the time elapsed since symptom onset. However, the most frequent findings are bilateral infiltrates with an interstitial or ground glass pattern, or bilateral alveolar opacities. Alterations in laboratory values are also frequent and varied, depending on disease severity, e.g. anaemia, leucocytosis, neutrophilia, lymphopenia, and elevated creatinine, erythrocyte sedimentation velocity (ESV), C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), serum ferritin, troponins, and cytokines (among other markers). The most frequent laboratory findings in seriously ill patients are lymphopenia, hypoalbuminemia, and increased ferritin and D-dimer; most of these alterations probably reflect increases in cytokines levels or the &quot;cytokine storm&quot; phenomenon (IL-2R, IL-6, IL-10 and TNFalpha).\nFew studies to date have shed light on the main factors associated with fatality rates in hospitalized patients. Most notably, a retrospective cohort study of 191 patients at two hospitals in China reported 41 deaths, and analysed the association of sex, age, chronic obstructive lung disease, coronary disease, diabetes, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and other comorbidities on the risk of death due to COVID-19. According to the multivariate models in this study, associations were detected only for patient age and two parameters measured on admission: Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and D-dimer concentration greater than 1 mug/ml. Other studies in similar conditions were made for Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) but the number of studies analysing prognosis factors on COVID-19 remain insufficient to date.\nThe aim of this study was to identify and quantify the associations between baseline characteristics on hospital admission in patients with COVID-19 infection (e.g. personal antecedents, physical examination and clinical findings, and laboratory results) and mortality at a tertiary hospital in Spain.\nMaterials and methods\nThis retrospective case series comprised 238 patients admitted for COVID-19 to Hospital Universitario Clinico San Cecilio, and who died or were discharged, between 16 March and 10 April 2020. This 480-bed tertiary hospital is located in the city of Granada (southern Spain), and provides specialized health care services to a total population of 291,797 inhabitants. Only positive PCR test was considered as diagnosis criteria for the patients included in our series. Therefore, patients presenting compatible symptoms and negative test were not included in the present study. The information detailed below was collected from electronic medical records for each patient.\nGeneral information on admission and recorded in the emergency service report\nSex, age (analysed as a continuous variable and also stratified into groups of 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, and 80 years or older), presence of comorbidities (HT; DM; previous lung disease; chronic kidney failure; CVD, or active neoplasia), dependence for basic activities of daily living (BADL) (yes or no), clinical findings on admission (low-grade or higher fever, dry cough, productive cough, haemoptysis, dyspnoea, anosmia, ageusia, headache, nausea, diarrhoea, other gastrointestinal symptoms, myalgia, fatigue, tiredness, general malaise, exanthema, odynophagia), smoking status (never smoker, current smoker, or ex-smoker) and place of residence (own home or retirement facility).\nVariables recorded from physical examination and laboratory tests on admission\nSystolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, basal oxygen saturation (SatO2), externally supplied oxygen (litres), fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2), SatO2/FiO2 ratio, haemoglobin, lymphocyte count, neutrophil count, platelet count, D-dimer level, glycaemia, total bilirubin, LDH, ferritin, CRP, procalcitonin, troponins, creatinine, kidney function (elevated urea and creatinine), partial O2 and CO2 pressure in arterial blood (PO2 and PCO2), CO2, arterial blood pH, SOFA score, CURB-65 score, and X-ray findings on admission (categorized as dichotomous variables), e.g. diffuse opacities, interstitial opacities, hilar congestion or pleural effusion.\nAnalysis of outcome variables: Death and days of hospital stay\nCentral tendency and dispersion were estimated for quantitative variables, and frequency distribution was determined for categorical variables. For each category in the latter, we estimated the distribution of discharges and deaths. Because our case series was defined on the basis of outcomes (discharge or death), it cannot be considered a true cohort of admitted patients, given that by definition we excluded patients who, at the end of the recruitment period (10 April 2020), remained hospitalized (censured data). For these patients the mean duration of hospital stay can be assumed to be longer than for patients included in the present case series. Because the length of hospital stay tends to be inversely associated with mortality, this association would lead to selection bias, which in turn would result in overestimating the proportion of deaths in our sample. In addition, it could potentially skew (in either direction) the magnitude of the associations between patient characteristics on admission and death. To compensate for this source of bias we opted to use time to death as a dependent variable and used Cox proportional hazards regression models to calculate hazard ratios (HR) in order to quantify the magnitude of associations between hazard or instantaneous death rate and patients' baseline characteristics.\nBecause of the low number of patients compared to the number of independent variables considered in this analysis, we used a three-step modelling process. First, we developed separate models for each baseline variable and for age. Next we defined subgroups of baseline variables (sociodemographic, symptoms, comorbidities, physical examination on admission, laboratory values, and X-ray findings), and used a stepwise process to build multivariate models for each variable (including age in all models). The variables selected in each model where then used in a stepwise procedure to build a final model that included baseline variables that were retained. In all cases the P value for inclusion in the model was set at 0.05, and the P value for exclusion was set at 0.10. The 95%CI was calculated for each HR. All data were analysed with STATA software (version 15.0).\nEthics\nThis study met the requirements for appropriateness to achieve the intended aims and complied with all ethical principles pertinent to this type of study design. All data were fully anonymized before the analyses. No informed consent was required due to the characteristics of the design. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Granada province (CEI) on 13 April 2020.\nResults\nSlightly more than half of our patients were males (55.0%, n = 131). The age range was 24 to 97 years with a mean of 64.7, standard deviation 15.4, and median 67 years. Most patients (60.5%) were 60 years old or more, and the largest age stratum was 70 to 79 years. At least one comorbidity was present on admission in 56.7% of the sample. Among the most prevalent diseases were HT (48.7%), DM (21.9%), and CVD (22.7%). About one fifth of the patients (19.8%) had dependence for BADL, and 10.9% lived in retirement homes (Table 1). On admission, the most frequent clinical profile was characterized by low-grade fever (89.5%), dry cough (80.7%), general malaise (63.5%), dyspnoea (61.3%) and tiredness (59.2%) (Table 1).\nSociodemographic and clinical characteristics, and distribution of deaths in each category.\nGroups	Category	N	%	Deaths	 	N	%1	 	Sociodemographic variables	Men	131	55.0	38	29.0	 	Women	107	45.0	23	21.5	 	Age groups:	30-39 years	13	5.5	0	0	 	40-49 years	29	12.2	0	0	 	50-59 years	52	21.9	3	5.8	 	60-69 years	47	19.8	6	12.8	 	70-79 years	49	20.6	14	28.6	 	&gt;=80 years	48	20.2	38	79.2	 	Retirement home residence	26	10.9	21	80.8	 	Smoking	Non-smoker	134	56.3	29	21.6	 	Current smoker	22	9.2	3	13.6	 	Ex-smoker	40	16.8	13	32.5	 	Comorbidities	Any comorbidity	135	56.7	55	40.7	 	Hypertension	116	48.7	47	40.5	 	Diabetes mellitus	52	21.9	27	51.2	 	Cardiovascular disease	54	22.7	36	66.7	 	Prior lung disease	50	21.0	22	44.0	 	Chronic kidney failure	23	9.7	15	65.2	 	Active neoplasia	8	3.4	3	37.5	 	Multiple medications	77	32.4	39	50.7	 	Dependence for basic activities of daily living	47	19.8	37	78.7	 	Clinical findings	Low-grade or higher fever	213	89.5	49	23.0	 	Dry cough	192	80.7	52	27.1	 	General malaise	151	63.5	42	27.8	 	Fatigue	141	59.2	32	22.7	 	Dyspnoea	146	61.3	43	29.5	 	Myalgia	105	44.1	15	14.3	 	Ageusia	55	23.1	1	1.8	 	Anosmia	48	20.2	2	4.2	 	Diarrhoea	70	29.4	8	11.4	 	Productive cough	62	26.1	16	25.8	 	Nausea	55	23.1	7	12.7	 	Headache	48	20.2	4	8.3	 	Odynophagia	23	9.7	6	26.1	 	Haemoptysis	8	3.4	1	12.5	 	Exanthema	3	1.3	0	0	 	Total		238	100	61	25.6	 	\n1 Percentage of deaths in each category of baseline variables.\nAlso shown in Table 1 are the proportions of deaths in the entire sample and for each category of baseline variables. About one fourth of the patients in the present series died (25.6%). No patients younger than 50 years died; as age increased, the proportion of deaths increased in an approximately exponential manner, e.g. 5.8% in patients aged 50 to 59 years (95%CI 1.2-15.9), 12.8% in those aged 60 to 69 (95%CI 4.8-25.7), 28.6% in those aged 70 to 79 (95%CI 16.6-43.3), and 79.2% in those 80 years old or more (95%CI 65.0-89.5). In our series only 5.8% (6 out of 103) of the patients with no prior comorbidities died. In contrast, 78.7% of our patients with dependence for BADL and 80.8% of those who resided in retirement homes died.\nTables 2 and 3 show the HR estimated with Cox stepwise regression models to quantify the association between hazard of death and variables recorded on admission (see Methods).\nHazard ratios for the association of baseline variables with hazard of death.\nGroup	Variable1	HR2	95%CI	HR3	95%CI	HR4	95%CI	 	Demographic variables	Male	1.34	0.80-2.27					 	Age1	1.09	1.07-1.12	1.09	1.07-1.11	1.03	1.01-1.06	 	Retirement home	1.19	0.64-2.22					 	Comorbidities and medications on admission	BADL dependence	2.98	1.57-5.64	2.51	1.38-3.94			 	Hypertension	1.48	0.80-2.71					 	Diabetes mellitus	2.55	1.53-4.26	2.33	1.38-3.94	2.42	1.43-4.09	 	Prior lung disease	0.93	0.52-1.64					 	Chronic kidney failure	0.97	0.51-1.83					 	Cardiovascular disease	1.93	1.08-3.46					 	Multiple medications	1.57	0.90-2.74					 	Symptoms on admission	Low-grade fever	0.61	0.32-1.16					 	Cough	1.40	0.69-2.84					 	Productive cough	1.02	0.57-1.80					 	Haemoptysis	0.94	0.13-6.84					 	Dyspnoea	1.64	0.94-2.84					 	Anosmia	0.26	0.06-1.09					 	Ageusia	0.11	0.02-0.83	0.11	0.02-0.83			 	Headache	1.25	0.40-3.88					 	Nausea	0.64	0.28-1.44					 	Muscle tiredness	0.75	0.45-1.26					 	Myalgia	0.60	0.33-1.09					 	Odynophagia	1.73	0.74-4.04					 	Diarrhoea	0.57	0.27-1.22					 	General malaise	1.28	0.74-2.21					 	Gastrointestinal symptoms	0.58	0.29-1.16					 	Fatigue	0.76	0.46-1.26					 	Duration of symptoms (days)1	0.98	0.91-1.05					 	Physical exam on admission	Fever	2.00	1.11-3.60					 	Baseline SatO21	0.93	0.91-0.95					 	Need for O2	5.17	2.35-11.41					 	FiO21	1.05	1.03-1.07					 	SatO2/FiO21	0.43	0.33-0.56	0.44	0.34-0.58	0.57	0.43-0.77	 	X-Ray findings on admission	Opacities	2.93	1.24-6.92					 	Interstitial opacities	2.37	1.28-4.40	2.36	1.24-4.49			 	Hilar congestion	1.28	0.71-2.32					 	Pleural effusion	1.21	0.60-2.43					 	\n1 Quantitative variables.

The variables included in the final model as associated with higher mortality were age (3% increase in HR per 1-year increase in age; 95%CI 1-6), DM (HR 2.42; 95%CI 1.43-4.09. Elevated SatO2/FiO2 ratio was inversely related with mortality (43% decrease per 1-point increase, 95%CI 23-57). None of the other baseline variables were independently associated with mortality.\nTable 3. show the laboratory parameters and prognostic scales on admission. The variables included in the final model as associated with higher mortality were SOFA score (19% increase per 1-point increase, 95%CI 5-34) and CURB-65 score (73% increase per 1-point increase, 95%CI 23-143). None of the other baseline variables were independently associated with mortality.\nDiscussion\nThe sex and age distribution in our series of patients differs from that reported by the WHO mission in China and from data published by the Spanish National Epidemiology Centre, both of which found very similar figures. In the present series the proportion of men was larger (55% vs. 51% in China) and median age was greater (67 years vs. 51 years in China). Our figures can be attributed in part to the greater population aging in Spain, where people aged 65 years or more account for nearly 50% of the population vs. 12% in China. In addition, evolution of the pandemic in Spain has lagged behind China, and this may mean that because the patients in our series are among the first in Spain for whom these early outcomes (discharge or death) are reported, our sample comprises a high proportion of patients with factors potentially associated with more severe illness: male sex and older age.\nRegarding the distribution of comorbidities and symptoms on hospital admission, our results are consistent with earlier studies in China, and with data from the Ministry of Health report on the status of COVID-19 in Spain as of 17 April 2020. In all series studied to date, the comorbidities associated most frequently with COVID-19 were CVD, DM and HT, and the most common clinical characteristics on admission were low-grade fever, dry cough, general malaise, fatigue, and dyspnoea. In our series, the presence of ageusia showed better prognosis of patients (HR 0.11; 95%CI 0.02-0.83) in the stepwise regression model including age and the remaining symptomatologic variables. This symptom has reported to be more frequent in younger patients and in women. Therefore, ageusia might bias the results as older age and male sex are associated with worse prognosis. Patients with cognitive impairment also would present difficulties to detect and express this specific symptom. This hypothesis should be tested in specific studies but, in any case, the association disappeared in our final models fitted for each group of variables. Regarding smoking, although several studies have pointed a worse progression and adverse outcomes of COVID-19, in our study we could not corroborate these results. Apart from the small number of current smokers in our sample (only 22 patients and 3 deaths among them) which may lead to high variability in the estimations for this subgroup, this fact might have two explanations. First, smoking habits were not systematically collected in all clinical records. Therefore, the existence of a considerable amount of missing data (42 patients) for this variable may have distorted the results. Second, patients with high number of comorbidities (i.e., DM, pulmonary diseases or living in retirement homes) might plausibly show a lower frequency of smoking habits given their condition, whilst their intrinsic risk of mortality is high. Again, this hypothesis should be tested in specific studies. Two findings from our crude analysis stand out: the low frequency of death in our patients with no comorbidities (5.8%), and the high percentage of deaths among patients with dependence for BADL (approaching 80%) and/or who lived in retirement homes. These three variables are closely related with each other, and with older age, as shown by the Cox regression models. Although we can venture no explanation for the reasons behind these relationships, these three variables alone or in combination appear to define a population group at high risk of death, as also suggested in earlier studies. We believe this high risk should be taken into account in setting priorities for the indication for hospital admission. In particular, patients who live in retirement homes are likely to have most of the risk factors we identified, and in fact, it is estimated that nearly 12,200 older persons have died during the current pandemic among residents of public, joint public-private, and private retirement facilities in Spain. This makes it imperative to develop specific, co-ordinated actions across all such centres during the epidemic, in order to ensure that the necessary material and human resources are available to care for these especially vulnerable patients. To date, few studies have analysed the causes of higher morbidity and mortality in this population group, and no such studies have been done in Spain. Our findings suggest the need for a specific approach to care for this group both in hospital emergency services and in residential retirement facilities.\nThe models we obtained with our adjusted analysis showed that in our series of patients hospitalized for COVID-19, characteristics present before SARS-CoV-2 infection that were independently associated mortality were age (exponential increase in patients 50 years old and older) and DM. A study from China based on a retrospective cohort of 191 patients identified CVD and DM as chronic diseases associated with greater mortality. However, in contrast to our finding for DM, Zhou and colleagues found that this association disappeared in their adjusted analysis. In this study, associations were detected only for patient age (odds ratio 1.10 per 1-year increase in age, 95% confidence interval [95%CI] 1.03-1.17).\nAt least one other review of comorbidities associated with COVID-19 found that CVD and DM were among the factors most strongly associated with an increased risk of mortality, although this was based only on crude data.\nWith regard to baseline variables relating to the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection on admission, those that yielded independent associations with mortality were greater need for externally supplied oxygen to maintain adequate saturation (low SatO2/FiO2 ratio as a result of ARDS) and high SOFA and CURB-65 scores. These findings are consistent with factors identified in earlier reports from countries other than Spain. Zhou and colleagues detected two risk parameters measured on admission: SOFA score (odds ratio 5.65, 95%CI 2.61-12.23) and D-dimer concentration greater than 1 mug/ml (odds ratio 18.42, 95%CI 2.64-128.55). Although D-dimer has been consistently associated with higher mortality, we could not corroborate these results in our study.\nAs noted in the Methods section, the main limitation of this study is the selection bias resulting from out inclusion criteria: patients who were either discharged or died, excluding those who were still hospitalized at the end of the recruitment period. Nonetheless, we feel the use of Cox regression models minimized the impact of this bias on the magnitude of our estimated associations, given that the estimates were a function of time to death. Because our patients comprise the first sample of people admitted with the characteristics reported here, the duration of follow-up was brief and this may have led to the selection of &quot;extreme&quot; cases, i.e. those who were the first to be discharged or the first to die in our hospital. This factor makes our findings especially useful for studies of the first patients to be hospitalized in other settings. These considerations, along with the chronology of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain, make it likely that the patients selected for this study differed from those who were still hospitalized at the end of the recruitment period. In other words, compared to subsequently admitted patients, those analysed here may have had more and/or more severe clinical signs and symptoms as grounds for admission. Another potential source of error is the lack of adjustment for variables we did not measure, either because they were not recorded in the medical records or were not considered relevant in light of our current (incomplete, constantly changing) knowledge of COVID-19. There is another potential bias concerning the selection of patients which are mainly elderly patients coming from a localized region in Spain. Therefore, the results could not be widely generalized. A final consideration is that we designed a monocentric study with a limited number of patients, while a great number of different factors were analysed as independent variables. This limited sample size necessitated a sequential process to develop our models, with a stepwise approach and low number of predictive variables.\nConclusions\nIn addition to the close association between mortality and comorbidities, dependence for BADL and living in a retirement facility in our crude analysis, the main baseline factors that were independently associated in our adjusted analysis with mortality in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 were older age, DM, low SatO2/FiO2 ratio, and high SOFA and CURB-65 scores. These characteristics define a profile of patients in Spain with an elevated mortality rate for whom a specific approach to clinical management is urgently needed.\nReferences\nMinisterio de Sanidad.

patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7092819","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical

(COVID-19) (formerly known as the 2019 novel coronavirus [2019-nCoV]) in Wuhan, China in December 2019, which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), more than 75,000 cases have been reported in 32 countries/regions, resulting in more than 2000 deaths worldwide.\n Despite the fact that most COVID-19 cases and mortalities were reported in China, the WHO has declared this outbreak as the sixth public health emergency of international concern.\n The COVID-19 can present as an asymptomatic carrier state, acute respiratory disease, and pneumonia.\n Adults represent the population with the highest infection rate; however, neonates, children, and elderly patients can also be infected by SARS-CoV-2. In addition, nosocomial infection of hospitalized patients and healthcare workers, and viral transmission from asymptomatic carriers are possible.\n The most common finding on chest imaging among patients with pneumonia was ground-glass opacity with bilateral involvement.\n Severe cases are more likely to be older patients with underlying comorbidities compared to mild cases.\n Indeed, age and disease severity may be correlated with the outcomes of COVID-19. To date, effective treatment is lacking; however, clinical trials investigating the efficacy of several agents, including remdesivir and chloroquine, are underway in China.\n Currently, effective infection control intervention is the only way to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2.","id":"PMC7128959","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Taiwan Society of Microbiology.

China.\n\n We aimed to further clarify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data.\n\n Outcomes were followed up until Jan 25, 2020.\nFindings\nOf the 99 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, 49 (49%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market.\n\n The average age of the patients was 55·5 years (SD 13·1), including 67 men and 32 women.\n\n 2019-nCoV was detected in all patients by real-time RT-PCR.\n\n 50 (51%) patients had chronic diseases.\n\n Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (82 [83%] patients), cough (81 [82%] patients), shortness of breath (31 [31%] patients), muscle ache (11 [11%] patients), confusion (nine [9%] patients), headache (eight [8%] patients), sore throat (five [5%] patients), rhinorrhoea (four [4%] patients), chest pain (two [2%] patients), diarrhoea (two [2%] patients), and nausea and vomiting (one [1%] patient).\n\n According to imaging examination, 74 (75%) patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 14 (14%) patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity, and one (1%) patient had pneumothorax.\n\n 17 (17%) patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and, among them, 11 (11%) patients worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection was of clustering onset, is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n In general, characteristics of patients who died were in line with the MuLBSTA score, an early warning model for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia.\n\n Further investigation is needed to explore the applicability of the MuLBSTA score in

Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China,

clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in pregnancy and the intrauterine vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 infection.\n\n\nMethods\nClinical records, laboratory results, and chest CT scans were retrospectively reviewed for nine pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia (ie, with maternal throat swab samples that were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) who were admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, from Jan 20 to Jan 31, 2020.

Features Predicting Mortality Risk in Patients With Viral Pneumonia: The MuLBSTA Score","abstract":"Objective\nThe aim of this study was to further clarify clinical characteristics and predict mortality risk among patients with viral pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nA total of 528 patients with viral pneumonia at RuiJin hospital in Shanghai from May 2015 to May 2019 were recruited.\n\n Multiplex real-time RT-PCR was used to detect respiratory viruses.\n\n Demographic information, comorbidities, routine laboratory examinations, immunological indexes, etiological detections, radiological images and treatment were collected on admission.\n\n\nResults\n76 (14.4%) patients died within 90 days in hospital.\n\n A predictive MuLBSTA score was calculated on the basis of a multivariate logistic regression model in order to predict mortality with a weighted score that included multilobular infiltrates (OR = 5.20, 95% CI 1.41–12.52, p = 0.010; 5 points), lymphocyte ? 0.8?109/L (OR = 4.53, 95% CI 2.55–8.05, p &lt; 0.001; 4 points), bacterial coinfection (OR = 3.71, 95% CI 2.11–6.51, p &lt; 0.001; 4 points), acute-smoker (OR = 3.19, 95% CI 1.34–6.26, p = 0.001; 3 points), quit-smoker (OR = 2.18, 95% CI 0.99–4.82, p = 0.054; 2 points), hypertension (OR = 2.39, 95% CI 1.55–4.26, p = 0.003; 2 points) and age ?60 years (OR = 2.14, 95% CI 1.04–4.39, p = 0.038; 2 points).\n\n 12 points was used as a cut-off value for mortality risk stratification.\n\n This model showed sensitivity of 0.776, specificity of 0.778 and a better predictive ability than CURB-65 (AUROC = 0.773 vs.\n\n 0.717, p &lt; 0.001).\n\n\nConclusion\nHere, we designed an easy-to-use clinically predictive tool for assessing 90-day mortality risk of viral pneumonia.\n\n It can accurately stratify hospitalized patients with viral pneumonia into relevant risk categories and could provide guidance to make further clinical decisions.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6901688","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Frontiers

Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

outcomes of current medical approaches for Middle East respiratory syndrome: A systematic review and meta?analysis","abstract":"Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a respiratory disease caused by MERS coronavirus.\n Because of lack of vaccination, various studies investigated the therapeutic efficacy of antiviral drugs and supportive remedies.\n A systematic literature search from 10 databases was conducted and screened for relevant articles.\n Studies reporting information about the treatment of MERS coronavirus infection were extracted and analyzed.\n Despite receiving treatment with ribavirin plus IFN, the case fatality rate was as high as 71% in the IFN?treatment group and exactly the same in patients who received supportive treatment only.\n Having chronic renal disease, diabetes mellitus and hypertension increased the risk of mortality (P &lt; .\n05), and chronic renal disease is the best parameter to predict the mortality.\n The mean of survival days from onset of illness to death was 46.6 (95% CI, 30.5?62.6) for the IFN group compared with 18.8 (95% CI, 10.3?27.4) for the supportive?only group (P = .\n001).\n Delay in starting treatment, older age group, and preexisting comorbidities are associated with worse outcomes.\n In conclusion, there is no difference between IFN treatment and supportive treatment for MERS patients in terms of mortality.\n However, ribavirin and IFN combination might have efficacious effects with timely administration and monitoring of adverse events.\n Large?scale prospective randomized studies are required to assess the role

Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data.\n\n Outcomes were followed up until Jan 25, 2020.\nFindings\nOf the 99 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, 49 (49%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market.\n\n The average age of the patients was 55·5 years (SD 13·1), including 67 men and 32 women.\n\n 2019-nCoV was detected in all patients by real-time RT-PCR.\n\n 50 (51%) patients had chronic diseases.\n\n Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (82 [83%] patients),

rhinorrhoea (four [4%] patients), chest pain (two [2%] patients), diarrhoea (two [2%] patients), and nausea and vomiting (one [1%] patient).\n\n According to imaging examination, 74 (75%) patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 14 (14%) patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity, and one (1%) patient had pneumothorax.\n\n 17 (17%) patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and, among them, 11 (11%) patients worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection was of clustering onset, is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n In general, characteristics of patients who died

the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with

hence it has risen many questions yet to be clarified.\n\n The aim of this study was to outline the main issues that led tobacco smoking being discussed as a potential risk factor associated with COVID-19.\nMethods:\narticles from MEDLINE and pre-prints published from January to April 2020 were identified.\n\n\nResults:\ndata from China showed that men had more severe outcomes of COVID-19 than women.\n\n Since smoking prevalence is very high among Chinese men in comparison to women, it was hypothesized that smoking could be a risk factor for poor prognosis.\n\n This was also supported by the higher prevalence of comorbidities, many of which tobacco-related diseases, in patients with severe COVID-19, who were also more likely to have a smoking history.\n\n A meta-analysis confirmed these results, reporting an OR=2.25 (95% CI: 1.49-3.39) for developing severe COVID-19 among patients with a smoking history.\n\n Some authors, noticing that reported smoking prevalence among hospitalized patients was substantially lower than smoking prevalence in the source populations, speculated a protective role of nicotine.\n\n However, it is likely that low prevalence among hospitalized patients are partially due to many smokers misclassified as nonsmokers.\n\n Tobacco smoking seems to cause a dose-dependent upregulation of angiotensin-converting-enzyme-2 (ACE2), the virus cellular entry receptor, which could explain the higher risk of severe COVID-19 in smokers.\n\n\nConclusions:\nThere is need for further independent studies to clarify the role of smoking on COVID-19 incidence, progression and mortality.\n\n (www.\n\nactabiomedica.\n\nit)\n","id":"PMC7569632","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Mattioli 1885","authors":[{"firstname":"Maria Sofia","surname":"Cattaruzza","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Vincenzo","surname":"Zagà","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Silvano","surname":"Gallus","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Paolo","surname":"D’Argenio","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Giuseppe","surname":"Gorini","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Characteristics of and Important Lessons From the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Outbreak in China: Summary of a Report of 72 314 Cases From the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical characteristics of 140 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"COVID-19 Does Not Lead to a &quot;Typical&quot;

novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China,

on admission, high levels of neutrophil, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and C-reactive protein, lower levels of platelets and albumin, and higher incidence of bilateral pneumonia and pleural effusion (P&lt;0.05).\n\n Refractory COVID-19 patients were more likely to receive oxygen, mechanical ventilation, expectorant, and adjunctive treatment including corticosteroid, antiviral drugs and immune enhancer (P&lt;0.05).\n\n After adjustment, those with refractory COVID-19 were also more likely to have a male sex and manifestations of anorexia and fever on admission, and receive oxygen, expectorant and adjunctive agents (P&lt;0.05) when considering the factors of disease severity on admission, mechanical ventilation, and ICU transfer.\n\n\nConclusion\nNearly 50% COVID-19 patients could not reach obvious clinical and radiological remission within 10 days after hospitalization.\n\n The patients with male sex, anorexia and no fever on admission predicted poor efficacy.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7184444","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Oxford University

diagnosis of covid-19 were analysed.\n\n Data were collected until 28 February 2020.\nMain outcome measures\nClinical characteristics and laboratory findings were obtained from electronic medical records with data collection forms.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of deceased patients (68 years) was significantly older than recovered patients (51 years).\n\n Male sex was more predominant in deceased patients (83; 73%) than in recovered patients (88; 55%).\n\n Chronic hypertension and other cardiovascular comorbidities were more frequent among deceased patients (54 (48%) and 16 (14%)) than recovered patients (39 (24%) and 7 (4%)).\n\n Dyspnoea, chest tightness, and disorder of consciousness were more common in deceased patients (70 (62%), 55 (49%), and 25 (22%)) than in recovered patients (50 (31%), 48 (30%), and 1 (1%)).\n\n The median time from disease onset to death in deceased patients was 16 (interquartile range 12.0-20.0) days.\n\n Leukocytosis was present in 56 (50%)

20 and February 22, 2020, were enrolled and their clinical data were retrospectively collected.\n\n Multivariate COX regression was used to identify the risk factors associated with progression, and

into stable group (n=168, 80.8%) and progressive group (n=40,19.2%) based on whether their conditions worsened during the hospitalization Univariate and multivariate analysis showed that comorbidity, older age, lower lymphocyte and higher lactate dehydrogenase at presentation were independent high-risk factors for COVID-19 progression.\n\n Incorporating these 4 factors, the nomogram achieved good concordance indexes of 0.86 (95%CI 0.81 - 0.91), and had well-fitted calibration curves.\n\n A novel scoring model, named as CALL, was established, and its area under ROC was 0.91 (95% CI 0.86 to

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with

Hospitalized Patients with Covid-19 — Preliminary Report","abstract":"Background\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is associated with diffuse lung damage.\n\n Glucocorticoids may modulate inflammation-mediated lung injury and thereby reduce progression to respiratory failure and death.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this controlled, open-label trial comparing a range of possible treatments in patients who were hospitalized with Covid-19, we randomly assigned patients to receive oral or intravenous dexamethasone (at a dose of 6 mg once daily) for up to 10 days or to receive usual care alone.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality.\n\n Here, we report the preliminary results of this comparison.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 2104 patients were assigned to receive dexamethasone and 4321 to receive usual care.\n\n Overall, 482 patients (22.9%) in the dexamethasone group and 1110 patients (25.7%) in the usual care group died within 28 days after randomization (age-adjusted rate ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75 to 0.93; P&lt;0.001).\n\n The proportional and absolute between-group differences in mortality varied considerably according to the level of respiratory support that the patients were receiving at the time of randomization.\n\n In the dexamethasone group, the incidence of death was lower than that in the usual care group among patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation (29.3% vs.\n\n 41.4%; rate ratio, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.81) and among those receiving oxygen without invasive mechanical ventilation (23.3% vs.\n\n 26.2%; rate ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72 to 0.94) but not among those who were receiving no respiratory support at randomization (17.8% vs.\n\n 14.0%; rate ratio, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.91 to 1.55).\n\n\nConclusions\nIn patients hospitalized with Covid-19, the use of dexamethasone resulted in lower 28-day mortality among those who were receiving either invasive mechanical ventilation or oxygen alone at randomization but not among those receiving no respiratory support.\n\n (Funded by the Medical Research Council and National Institute for Health Research and others; RECOVERY ClinicalTrials.\n\ngov number, NCT04381936;

COVID-19 pandemic has been a challenge.\n\n Biomarkers have always played an important role in clinical decision making in various infectious diseases.\n\n It is crucial to assess the role of biomarkers in evaluating severity of disease and appropriate allocation of resources.\n\n\nDesign and setting\nSystematic review and meta-analysis.\n\n English full text observational studies describing the laboratory findings and outcomes of COVID-19 hospitalised patients were identified searching PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, medRxiv using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms COVID-19 OR coronavirus OR SARS-CoV-2 OR 2019-nCoV from 1 December 2019 to 15 August 2020 following Meta-analyses Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines.\n\n\nParticipants\nStudies having biomarkers, including lymphocyte, platelets, D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C reactive protein (CRP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), creatinine, procalcitonin (PCT) and creatine kinase (CK), and describing outcomes were selected with the consensus of three independent reviewers.\n\n\nMain outcome measures\nComposite poor outcomes include intensive care unit admission, oxygen saturation &lt;90%, invasive mechanical ventilation utilisation, severe disease, in-hospital admission and mortality.\n\n The OR and 95%?CI were obtained and forest plots were created using random-effects models.\n\n Publication bias and heterogeneity were assessed by sensitivity analysis.\n\n\nResults\n32 studies with 10?491 confirmed COVID-19 patients were included.\n\n We found that lymphopenia (pooled-OR: 3.33 (95% CI: 2.51–4.41); p&lt;0.00001), thrombocytopenia (2.36 (1.64–3.40); p&lt;0.00001), elevated D-dimer (3.39 (2.66–4.33); p&lt;0.00001), elevated CRP (4.37

diseases may increase the risk of transmission.\n\n A fast and convenient differential diagnosis between COVID-19 and influenza has significant clinical value, especially for low- and middle-income countries with a shortage of nucleic acid detection kits.\n\n We aimed to establish a diagnostic model to differentiate COVID-19 and influenza based on clinical data.\n\n\nMaterial/Methods\nA total of 493 patients were enrolled in the study, including 282 with COVID-19 and 211 with influenza.\n\n All data were collected and reviewed retrospectively.\n\n The clinical and laboratory characteristics of all patients were analyzed and compared.\n\n We then randomly divided all patients into development sets and validation sets to establish a diagnostic model using multivariate logistic regression analysis.\n\n Finally, we validated the diagnostic model using the validation set.\n\n\nResults\nWe preliminarily established a diagnostic model for differentiating COVID-19 from influenza that consisted of 5 variables: age, dry cough, fever, white cell count, and D-dimer.\n\n The model showed good performance for differential diagnosis.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis initial model including clinical features and laboratory indices effectively differentiated COVID-19 from influenza.\n\n Patients with a high score were at a high risk of having COVID-19, while patients with a low score were at a high risk of having influenza.\n\n This model could help clinicians quickly identify and isolate cases in the absence of nucleic acid tests, especially during the cocirculation of COVID-19 and influenza.\n\n Owing to the study’s retrospective nature, further prospective study is needed to validate the accuracy of the model.\n\n\n","id":"PMC8127639","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"International Scientific Literature,

Many infected patients, however, presented mild flu-like symptoms and quickly recover. To effectively prioritize resources for patients with the highest risk, we identified clinical predictors of mild and severe patient outcomes.\nUsing the database of Jin Yin-tan Hospital and Tongji Hospital, we conducted a retrospective multicenter study of 68 death cases (68/150, 45%) and 82 discharged cases (82/150, 55%) with laboratory-confirmed infection of SARS-CoV-2. Patients met the discharge criteria if they had no fever for at least 3 days, significantly improved respiratory function, and had negative SARS-CoV-2 laboratory test results twice in succession. Case data included demographics, clinical characteristics, laboratory results, treatment options and outcomes. For statistical analysis, we represented continuous measurements as means (SDs) or as medians (IQRs) which compared with Student's t test or the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test. Categorical variables were expressed as numbers (%) and compared by the chi2 test or Fisher's exact test.\na Age distribution of patients with confirmed COVID-19; b key laboratory parameters for the outcomes of patients with confirmed COVID-19; c interval from onset of symptom to death of patients with confirmed COVID-19; d summary of the cause of death of 68 died patients with confirmed COVID-19\nThe distribution of the enrolled patients' age is shown in Fig. 1a. There was a significant difference in age between the death group and the discharge group (p &lt; 0.001) but no difference in the sex ratio (p = 0.43). A total of 63% (43/68) of patients in the death group and 41% (34/82) in the discharge group had underlying diseases (p = 0.0069). It should be noted that patients with cardiovascular diseases have a significantly increased risk of death when they are infected with SARS-CoV-2 (p &lt; 0.001). A total of 16% (11/68) of the patients in the death group had secondary infections, and 1% (1/82) of the patients in the discharge group had secondary infections (p = 0.0018). Laboratory results showed that there were significant differences in white blood cell counts, absolute values of lymphocytes, platelets, albumin, total bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen, blood creatinine, myoglobin, cardiac troponin, C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) between the two groups (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 1).\nThe survival times of the enrolled patients in the death group were analyzed. The distribution of survival time from disease onset to death showed two peaks, with the first one at approximately 14 days (22 cases) and the second one at approximately 22 days (17 cases) (Fig. 1c). An analysis of the cause of death was performed. Among the 68 fatal cases, 36 patients (53%) died of respiratory failure, five patients (7%) with myocardial damage died of circulatory failure, 22 patients (33%) died of both, and five remaining died of an unknown cause (Fig. 1d). Based on the analysis of the clinical data, we confirmed that some patients died of fulminant myocarditis. In this study, we first reported that the infection of SARS-CoV-2 may cause fulminant myocarditis. Given that fulminant myocarditis is characterized by a rapid progress and a severe state of illness, our results should alert physicians to pay attention not only to the symptoms of respiratory dysfunction but also the symptoms of cardiac injury.\nFurther, large-scale studies and the studies on autopsy are needed to confirm our analysis.\nIn conclusion, predictors of a fatal outcome in COVID-19 cases included age, the presence of underlying diseases, the presence of secondary infection and elevated inflammatory indicators in the blood. The results obtained from this study also suggest that COVID-19 mortality might be due to virus-activated &quot;cytokine storm syndrome&quot; or fulminant myocarditis.\nElectronic supplementary material\nBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material.\nPublisher's Note\nSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.\nQiurong Ruan and Kun Yang have contributed equally to this work.\nChange history\n4/6/2020\nClinical predictors of mortality due to COVID-19 based on an analysis of data of 150 patients from Wuhan, China.\nAuthors contribution\nJXS, QRR and KY contributed to the conception and design of the study, had full access to all the data in the study and take responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.

venoarterial extracorporeal membranous oxygenation (ECMO) support is effective in patients with cardiogenic shock or fatal arrhythmia due to fulminant myocarditis.\n\n The clinical courses of fulminant myocarditis are still uncertain; therefore, it is difficult to determine the appropriate time for discontinuing ECMO or converting to a ventricular assist device.\n\n The purpose of this study was to investigate the prognosis of patients with fulminant myocarditis managed by ECMO.\n\n\nMethods\nTwenty-two consecutive patients with fulminant myocarditis managed by peripheral venoarterial ECMO between 1999 and 2013 were enrolled.\n\n\nResults\nSurvival to discharge was 59% (13 patients), and in-hospital mortality was 41% (9 patients).\n\n The age in the survivor group was significantly lower than that in the non-survivor group (survivor group vs.\n\n non-survivor group; 36.5?±?4.1 vs.\n\n 60.2?±?5.0 years, p?=?0.001).\n\n Although the ECMO support duration was similar between the groups (181?±?22 vs.\n\n 177?±?31 h), the rate of complication related to ECMO was significantly lower in the survivor group (15.3% vs.\n\n 66.6%, p?=?0.02).\n\n When comparing the laboratory data during ECMO management between the groups, the serum bilirubin level on day 7 was significantly lower in the survivor group (total: 4.6?±?2.8 vs.\n\n 13.7?±?10.8 mg/dL, p?=?0.014; direct: 2.2?±?0.5 vs.\n\n 9.8?±?4.5 mg/dL, p?=?0.009).\n\n\nConclusions\nFulminant myocarditis is associated with high mortality rates despite ECMO.\n\n An older age and complications related to ECMO are associated with poor prognosis.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4336280","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

favorable; however, for 32–36% of patients, this condition becomes fatal during the acute stages despite the use of mechanical circulatory support.\n\n Other therapeutic options may be needed for patients in whom these conditions are resistant to aggressive management.\n\n\nCase Report:\nWe present a case of fulminant myocarditis that rapidly progressed to cardiogenic shock and in-hospital cardiac arrest in a 46-year-old male.\n\n The patient promptly received inotropic agents, intra-aortic balloon pump therapy, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.\n\n However, creatinine kinase (CK), C-reactive protein (CRP), and QRS width increased significantly between days 1 and 3 of treatment; the patient’s hemodynamic profile deteriorated despite this treatment regimen.\n\n Intravenous methylprednisolone was initiated on day 3 at a dose of 1,000 mg/day and maintained for an additional three days.\n\n Less than 24 h after methylprednisolone administration, the QRS width decreased

who were admitted to the Critical Care Unit of Guangdong General Hospital (Guangzhou, China) between January 2001 and December 2010 were reviewed.\n A cohort of 58 patients was included in the

This is a retrospective single-center study for patients who were admitted with COVID-19 infection. Data collection was from 1 March through 24 April 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and treatment data were presented using descriptive statistics and frequencies. The chi 2 test and multivariate logistic regression were used to determine association of risk factors and clinical outcomes. A total of 242 inpatients were included with a mean age of 66 +- 14.75 (+-standard deviation). A total of 50% were female and 70% were African American. Comorbidities included hypertension (74%), diabetes mellitus (49%), and 19% had either COPD or asthma. Older age was associated with higher risk of inpatient death odds ratio (OR): 1.056 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.023-1.090; P = .001).

Majority of hospitalized patients had hypertension and diabetes. Older age was an independent risk factor for inpatient mortality. Requirement of mechanical ventilation, vasopressor use, and CRRT/HD was associated significantly with inpatient mortality. Higher baseline CRP was significantly associated with inpatient death.\nHighlights\nMajority of patients in inner city are African American and Hispanic who have higher prevalence of hypertension and diabetes.\nSex, BMI, race, and underlying co-morbidities are not associated with worse outcomes as survivors and non-survivors have similar baseline characteristics and our population are relatively sicker compared to previous studies.\nOlder age was an independent risk factor for inpatient mortality.\nINTRODUCTION\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) or coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the novel coronavirus that was first detected in Wuhan, Hubei, China which has rapidly spread in different countries within a few months and now is considered as a pandemic threat. As of 2 May 2020, this virus has affected 3 420 000 globally, with over a million confirmed cases in the United States (US). Philadelphia ranked 13th (15 137) amongst US counties with the most number of confirmed cases, with majority of the affected population being elderly nursing home residents. Einstein Healthcare Network is an inner city urban community hospital in Northern Philadelphia and has admitted a large proportion of COVID-19 patients in the area. At the time of data analysis, there were approximately 15 137 cases in Philadelphia county, which was before the peak period. Einstein Medical Center had a total of 237 admitted COVID-19 patients to which 106 were confirmed and 131 were suspected. There are limited and underrepresented data with regards to previous COVID-19 studies that describe the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients in minority population such as African Americans, Hispanic, and Asians. The primary objective of this analysis was to describe the general demographics and clinical factors of COVID-19 inpatients of a minority population in an underserved area. It aimed to describe their clinical outcomes namely (a) inpatient mortality, (b) need for mechanical ventilation, (c) need for vasopressors, and (d) need for continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT)/hemodialysis (HD). The secondary objective was to determine association of these clinical factors with the respective clinical outcomes in this special population.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nStudy design, participants, and data collection\nThis study was a single-center retrospective case series during 1 March to 24 April 2020. Included were all patients more than 18 years old with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 via reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assays. Samples were obtained by nasopharyngeal swab or a closed endotracheal suction by Lukens. We included data from patients that were either discharged or who died. We excluded patients who were still inpatient as of the chart-review and those who had incomplete data on clinical outcomes thus only those who were either discharged or who died were included in the study. We also excluded patients on Remdesivir or convalescent plasma as these were recently introduced treatments and patients who were on this were still inpatient at the time of analysis and did not have the desired clinical outcomes yet. The primary outcome was inpatient mortality and the secondary outcomes were need for vasopressors, CRRT/HD, and mechanical ventilation. Demographic, clinical characteristics, laboratory, and treatment data were extracted from electronic medical records with a standardized data collection form. Informed consent was waived since this was a retrospective study. IRB approval was obtained with an IRB number: 2020-436.\nStatistical analysis\nDemographic variables were presented using descriptive statistics and frequencies. Categorical variables were analyzed with chi 2 testing. Demographic and clinical variables were tabulated. Stratification of inpatient death and need for intubation by quartile of age were included. The chi 2 was used to analyze the relationship between demographic or comorbidity variables and inpatient death, need for intubation, need for CRRT/HD, and vasopressor use. Multivariate logistic regression was used to look at the factors associated with inpatient mortality as primary outcome, and need for vasopressors, CRRT/HD, and mechanical ventilation as secondary outcomes. Separate multivariate logistic regression was also done for each inflammatory marker as there are concerns of collinearity. These inflammatory markers may be highly correlated with one another going in the same direction based on increasing disease severity, thus, they may potentially alter the results and predictive effects. P value of less than .05 was considered significant. 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used and are presented when appropriate.\nRESULTS\nDemographic and comorbidities of the patients\nA total of 389 patients were evaluated in our hospital and tested positive via PCR for COVID-19. A total of 122 patients were excluded from data analysis as they were still admitted at the time of data analysis as clinical outcomes specifically inpatient death, and need for vasopressors, CRRT/HD and mechanical ventilation cannot be fully elicited. Also, 25 patients with incomplete data were excluded leaving a final sample of 242 patients analyzed (see Figure 1). In the final sample of 242 patients (see Table 1), the mean age (+-standard deviation) was 66 +- 14.75, 49% were females, and 70% were African Americans. Chronic medical conditions of these patients include hypertension (74%), diabetes mellitus (49%), and 19% had either COPD or asthma. There were no statistically significant differences in the rates of diabetes and hypertension compared to clinical outcomes respectively when stratified by sex. However, there was a significantly higher rate of obesity (body mass index [BMI] &gt;30) in females compared to males (51% vs 29%; P = .001) (see Table S1). In terms of race, even though there was a statistically significant higher rates of obesity among African Americans compared to other races (47% vs 30%; P = .007), there were no differences in the rates of hypertension or diabetes compared to other races (see Table S2). Mean BMI was 29.32 +- 9.22 kg/m2 with 40% of our population were obese (BMI &gt;30 kg/m2).\nConsort diagram\nClinical characteristic of the patients at baseline\nCharacteristics	Total (N = 242) n (%)	Died (N = 52) n (%)	Survived (N = 190) n (%)	P value	 	Age median (IQR)	66 (58-76)	73.15 +- 11.01	64.08 +- 15.07	&lt;.0001	 	Female gender	119 (49)	25 (48)	94(50)	.8770	 	Ethnicity				.188	 	African American	171 (70)	34 (65)	137 (72)		 	Caucasian	17 (7)	3 (6)	14 (7)		 	Hispanic	26 (11)	4 (8)	22 (12)		 	Other	28 (12)	11 (21)	17 (9)		 	Comorbidities					 	BMI (mean +- SD)	29.39 +- 9.22	28.29 +- 8.40	29.68 +- 9.42	.355	 	COPD	30 (12)	7 (14)	23 (12)	.813	 	Asthma	18 (7)	0 (0)	18 (10)	.021	 	Heart failure	35 (15)	13 (25)	22 (12)	.015	 	Atrial fibrillation	24 (10)	6 (12)	18 (10)	.659	 	Liver cirrhosis	8 (3)	2 (4)	6 (3)	.806	 	Diabetes	118 (49)	30 (58)	88 (46)	.161	 	Chronic kidney disease	42 (17)	11 (21)	31 (16)	.414	 	Coronary artery disease	45 (19)	14 (27)	31 (16)	.106	 	Hypertension	180 (74)	42 (81)	138 (73)	.234	 	Obesity	97 (40)	21 (40)	76 (40)	1.000	 	Clinical and laboratory parameters on admission (mean +- SD)	 	FiO2% requirement	39 +- 28	80 (29-100)	21 (21-32)	&lt;.0001	 	Ferritin, ng/mL	1888 +- 2836	1357 (634-2743)	660 (255-1671)	.004	 	D-dimer, ng/mL	3855 +- 6143	2200 (1410-3490)	1535 (800-2975)	.011	 	CRP, mg/dL	145 +- 116	186 (113-274)	100 (38-168)	&lt;.0001	 	Procalcitonin, ng/mL	2.19 +- 7.07	0.87 (0.19-4.84)	0.16 (0.07-0.42)	&lt;.0001	 	LDH, IU/L		510 (406-654)	360 (246-524)	&lt;.0001	 	COVID-19 treatment					 	Hydroxychloroquine	145 (60)	43 (83)	102 (54)	&lt;.0001	 	Steroids	55 (23)	27 (52)	28 (15)	&lt;.0001	 	Tocilizumab	21 (9)	8 (15)	13 (7)	.090	 	Clinical outcomes					 	Need for CRRT/HD	24 (10)	14 (27)	10 (5)	&lt;.0001	 	Need for vasopressors	49 (20)	36 (69)	13 (7)	&lt;.0001	 	Need for mechanical ventilation	54 (22)	38 (73)	16 (8)	&lt;.0001	 	\nAbbreviations: COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019; CRRT, continuous renal replacement therapy; HD, hemodialysis; IQR, interquartile range; SD, standard deviation.\nClinical and laboratory parameters on admission, and COVID-19 treatment\nMean FiO2% requirement was 39% on admission with higher mean FiO2 requirement (80%) amongst patient who died (P &lt; .001). Inflammatory markers such as CRP, procalcitonin, and LDH were more elevated on admission among those who had inpatient mortality (P &lt; .001). A total of 60% received hydroxychloroquine, 23% received steroids, and less than 10% received the interleukin-6 (IL-6) inhibitor tocilizumab. There were significantly higher rates of hydroxychloroquine and steroids treatment among patients who died (See Table 1).\nPrimary and secondary clinical outcomes\nInpatient mortality as primary outcome was 52 out of 242 (21%). Secondary outcomes namely need for CRRT/HD, vasopressors, and mechanical ventilation were 10%, 20%, and 22%, respectively. A total of 14 out of 24 (58%) who required CRRT/HD, 36 out of 49 (69%) who needed vasoactive pressor, and 38 out of 54 (73%) who needed mechanical ventilation had inpatient mortality (P &lt; .0001).\nAssociation of baseline characteristic, comorbidities, clinical, and laboratory parameters to clinical outcomes\nMultivariable logistic regression was performed to determine independent predictors of the primary and secondary outcomes. For primary outcome, only age was significantly associated with a higher risk of inpatient death odds ratio (OR): 1.056 (95% CI: 1.023-1.090; P = .001) (see Table 2). As described in Table 1, mean age was significantly higher in patients who died compared to those who survived (73.15 +- 11.01 vs 64.08 +- 15.07; P &lt; .0001). Going up progressively from the age quartiles, the rates of death were statistically significantly increased from 5% to as high as 35% in the oldest quartile age group (P &lt; .0001). In fact, over 94% of patients who died in our sample population were 58 years old and above. There were also trends towards increased mechanical ventilation in the older age quartiles, but this was not statistically significant (P = .077) (see Figure 2). Mean FiO2 on admission was also higher on admission among nonsurvivors compared to survivors (80% vs 21%; P &lt; .0001). For secondary outcomes, there were no baseline characteristics, comorbidities, clinical, or laboratory parameters on admission that were significantly associated with the need for CRRT/HD, vasopressors, or mechanical ventilation. Though there were trends towards significance for diabetes and need for vasopressors OR: 2.139 (95% CI: 0.996-4.595; P = .051) and for history of heart failure and need for CRRT/HD OR: 3.238 (95% CI: 0.999-10.490; P = .05) (see Table S3).\nMultivariable logistic regression for factors associated with inpatient mortality\nCharacteristics	Odds ratio (95% CI)	P value	 	Age	1.056 (1.023-1.090)	.001	 	BMI	1.022 (0.977-1.069)	.349	 	Male	Referrant		 	Female	0.729 (0.351-1.512)	.396	 	African American	Referrant		 	Caucasian	2.899 (0.608-13.827)	.182	 	Hispanic	0.738 (0.193-2.828)	.658	 	Others	2.061 (0.760-5.591)	.155	 	COPD and asthma	0.471 (0.156-1.428)	.184	 	DM	1.450 (0.672-3.129)	.344	 	HTN	0.954 (0.375-2.426)	.922	 	HF	2.125 (0.835-5.410)	.114	 	cirrhosis	2.605 (0.389-17.428)	.324	 	CKD	0.806 (0.317-2.048)	.651	 	\nAbbreviations: BMI, body mass index; CI, confidence interval.\nStratification of inpatient death and need for intubation by quartiles of age\nAssociation of baseline inflammatory markers and inpatient death\nMultivariable logistic regression was performed separately to evaluate the association of inflammatory baseline markers with primary outcome as inpatient death.

Likewise, the use of steroids and hydroxychloroquine were significantly associated with inpatient death, need for intubation, CRRT/HD, and vasopressor use (see Table 4).\nAssociation of COVID-19 specific treatments with clinical outcomes comparing use and nonuse\n	Primary outcome	Secondary outcomes	 	Inpatient mortality (%)	Need for CRRT/HD (%)	Need for vasopressor (%)	Need for intubation (%)		 	Tocilizumab	38 vs 20	14 vs 10	43 vs 18	62 vs 19	 	P = .0900	P = .4470	P = .0190	P &lt; .0001	 	Steroids	49 vs 13	22 vs 12	49 vs 12	58 vs 12	 	P &lt; .0001	P = .0030	P &lt; .0001	P &lt; .0001	 	Hydroxychloroquine	30 vs 9	16 vs 1	28 vs 8	34 vs 5	 	P &lt; .0001	P &lt; .0001	P &lt; .0001	P &lt; .0001	 	\nAbbreviations: COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019; CRRT, continuous renal replacement therapy; HD, hemodialysis.\nDISCUSSION\nIn this retrospective single-center study, clinical characteristics were described, and risk factors were determined in association with inpatient death, need for intubation, need for CRRT/HD, and vasopressor use among hospitalized COVID-19 patients in an underserved minority population. Majority of these patients had hypertension (74%), almost half had diabetes mellitus (49%), and almost one fifth have obstructive lung disease (either COPD or asthma). The rates of comorbidities were significantly higher compared to the reported hospitalized patients in Wuhan, China, and in Washington state. In New York City, a report by Richardson et al showed lower rates of hypertension (56.6%), diabetes (33.8%), and chronic respiratory disease (14.4%) compared to our population. Another study by Palaiodimos et al from Bronx, New York reported higher rate of hypertension (76%) but lower rate diabetes (39.5%). Thus, our study samples are relatively sicker population compared to previous studies. This can be explained as our patient population have higher proportion of African Americans (70%). They have genetic predisposition, socioeconomic factors, and pathophysiological differences with higher risk for various cardiometabolic risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia that may explain the discrepancy in comorbidities. As the morbidity and mortality report in Georgia on March 2020, to which 83.2% of their population were non-Hispanic black, showed that 67.5% had hypertension and such was more common among black vs nonblack patients (69.6% vs 54.0%; P = .047). \nOlder age was established as a risk factor for inpatient death in COVID-19 patients. Multivariate regression analysis showed that age as a continuous variable is significantly associated with inpatient mortality (P &lt; .001) with mean age higher amongst patient who died compared to those who survived (73 vs 64 years old; P &lt; .0001). This finding was consistent with a retrospective cohort by Zhou et al, to which 69 years old and older were significantly associated with death. In a logistic regression analysis by Palaiodimos et al, age was significantly associated with in-hospital mortality (OR: 1.03; 95% CI: 1.00-1.07; P = .041). Aging accompanies a decrease in functional cell-mediated immune response, increased production of IL-6, more prolonged inflammatory response and increased production of clotting factors (poor clearance of fibrin from circulation, increased levels of D-dimer) which leads to increase incidence and severity of response to infections, including the ones from intracellular organisms like viruses. \nRequirement of mechanical ventilation, vasopressor, and renal replacement therapy (CRRT/HD) was also associated significantly with inpatient death. These findings were similar to the report of the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre (ICNARC) May 2020. This described critically ill COVID-19 patients in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland National Health Services (NHS) and non-NHS critical care units to which more than half needed advance respiratory support (62%) and any renal replacement therapy (75%) died in critical care. A retrospective study in Wuhan, China by Zhou et al reported that 97% of patients who were intubated and 100% of those who received renal replacement therapy died during hospitalization. In Washington, mortality was more than 50% in intubated patients. In New York City, 88% who received mechanical ventilation and 96% who received kidney replacement therapy died as well. There is limited information regarding association of vasopressors and inpatient mortality but the aforementioned ICNARC report showed 71% and 83.4% respective deaths in combined respiratory/cardiac and combined respiratory/renal/cardiac support respectively. However, selection bias has to be considered in the association, as patients who received invasive ventilation, vasopressor, and renal replacement therapy were likely relatively sicker or these other surrogate outcomes merely reflected the degree of end-organ damage involved and hence risk of mortality.\nSex, BMI, and race were not established to have an association with poor clinical outcomes in our study. However, Palaiodimos et al described male sex was independently associated with higher in-hospital mortality (OR: 3.35; 95% CI: 1.51-7.46; P = .003). Studies also linked obesity to severe COVID-19 as it is associated decreased functional capacity and pulmonary compliance, and chronic inflammatory state with increased proinflammatory cytokines further aggravating cytokine storm. Discrepancy in observations can be attributed to significantly higher rates of obesity among females in our study group (P &lt; .0001) (See Table S1). Metabolic comorbidities such as hypertension, coronary artery disease, and diabetes were also higher among females, however, were not statistically significant. In addition, the rate of obesity has no significant difference between patients who died and who survived as 40% of our population have BMI more than 30 kg/m2. Although African American patients, who were 70% of our study population, tended to have higher rates of obesity, hypertension, and diabetes, there was no significant difference compared to other races (see Table S2). This is likely due to our unique underserved-inner city patient population. We have significant numbers of other racial minorities such as Hispanics and Asians. In fact, Caucasians were underrepresented in our sample population (see Table 1). Data have shown that deaths with COVID-19 are higher in racial minorities since other social-economic factors such as food and housing security and access to healthcare may play a role. Hence, the lack of association of BMI, sex, and race with poor clinical outcomes can be explained by similar risk factor profile and similar socioeconomic profile of our patient population, who are generally sicker compared to study population in other published COVID-19 studies.\nPatients in this study who received COVID-19 specific treatment (steroid, tocilizumab, and hydroxychloroquine) had poor clinical outcomes. There are conflicting observations regarding steroid use. In Wuhan, 48% of patients who received corticosteroids died (P = .0005). The same observations were noted in a study by Bhatraju. Glucocorticoid treatment for SARS-CoV 2003 and MERS-CoV was also associated with worse clinical outcomes. However, another nonrandomized study showed treatment with methylprednisolone decreased the risk of death among COVID-19 patients with ARDS. Hydroxychloroquine, on the other hand, has failed to show accelerating viral clearance for in-hospital COVID-19 patients in multiple reports. Use of hydroxychloroquine alone was associated with increased overall mortality compared with no hydroxychloroquine. Also, its use with or without azithromycin did not reduce the risk of mechanical ventilation. For tocilizumab, there were only retrospective and single-arm observational studies available to which it has still insufficient clinical data to determine its harm or benefit. The issue with all these treatment outcomes is the possibility of selection bias as the current guidelines only recommend the use of these &quot;COVID-19 specific&quot; treatments in the setting of a clinical trial which may prompt usage only in cases where the perceived disease morbidity or severity is high which can skew the mortality rates towards patients who are using these medications.\nInflammatory markers are currently used to monitor disease progression. Severe COVID-19 infection manifests as a cytokine storm syndrome. Patients in cytokine storm progress to cardiovascular collapse, multiple organ dysfunction, and eventually die rapidly. In this study, only elevated baseline CRP was significantly associated with inpatient death. Mean CRP on admission among those who died was higher compared to those who survived were 186 vs 100 mg/dL (P &lt; .0001). Another retrospective study showed not only D-dimer but including high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I, serum ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, and IL-6 were elevated in nonsurvivors compared with survivors. In addition, a study by Wu C et al showed 85.6% patients with ARDS had increased CRP but association to inpatient death was not established. Nevertheless, the association of CRP in our study had a low odds ratio of 1.008 (95% CI: 1.003-1.012; P = .002) which makes it not that useful as associated factor or predictor. Clearly more studies perhaps with enough sample population to help establish thresholds values are needed to better elicit the roles of these inflammatory markers in terms of clinical outcomes or prognostication in COVID-19. In addition, it seems like signs of multiorgan failure such as need for intubation and respiratory failure or need for CRRT/HD or acute renal failure seem to be more reliable signs of poor outcomes in patients with COVID-19 than the actual quantitative markers of inflammation.\nLIMITATIONS\nThis is a retrospective single-center experience study and was not powered to detect differences in outcomes for the treatments or medications. Some of the samples for COVID-19 were sent out to the local Department of Health during the early period of the COVID-19 pandemic this may add heterogeneity to the manner of testing. This study did not account for other potential confounding factors such as the use of home medications such as NSAIDs and ACE/ARBs. Another limitation was not accounting for time of initial symptoms to treatment or medications as this study points more to severity of presentation on hospital admission. There is also selection bias in terms of COVID-19 specific treatment as it seems like the sickest patients got more treatment and, hence having poorer outcomes. We did not do an in-depth analysis concerning the effects of these disease-specific treatments as it is already beyond the scope of this study. Continuous adaptation of COVID-19 specific treatments was also based on existing evidences that are made available. This issue remains dynamic so changes in prescribing patterns for these medications may need to be taken into account. Other confounding clinical factors such as concomitant secondary bacterial superinfections and acute flare-ups of existing comorbidities may also play a role in influencing clinical outcomes which were not accounted for in our analysis.\nCONCLUSION\nMajority of inpatients COVID-19 have hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Age was found as an independent risk factor for inpatient mortality as it increases significantly after 58 years old. Requirement of mechanical ventilation, vasopressor, and renal replacement therapy (CRRT/HD) was also associated significantly with inpatient mortality. Amongst inflammatory markers, only elevated baseline CRP was significantly associated with inpatient death however its use in prognostic association may be limited.\nCONFLICT OF INTERESTS\nThe authors declare that there are no conflict of interests.\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTION\nAll the authors were involved in conceptualization and planning of the manuscript.

in China","abstract":"Background\nSince December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7092819","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical

consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from January 1st to February 5th.\n\n The cases were divided into general and refractory COVID-19 groups according to the clinical efficacy after hospitalization, and the difference between groups were compared.\n\n\nResults\nCompared with general COVID-19 patients (45.2%), refractory patients had an older age, male sex, more underlying comorbidities, lower incidence of fever, higher levels of maximum temperature among fever cases, higher incidence of breath shortness and anorexia, severer disease assessment on admission, high levels of neutrophil, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and C-reactive protein, lower levels of platelets and albumin, and higher incidence of bilateral pneumonia and pleural effusion (P&lt;0.05).\n\n Refractory COVID-19 patients were more likely to receive oxygen, mechanical ventilation, expectorant, and adjunctive treatment including corticosteroid, antiviral drugs and immune enhancer (P&lt;0.05).\n\n After adjustment, those with refractory COVID-19 were also more likely to have a male sex and manifestations of anorexia and fever on admission,

and Associations","abstract":"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a systemic disorder with a complex multifactorial pathogenesis and heterogenous clinical manifestations.\n NAFLD, once believed to be an innocuous condition, has now become the most common cause of chronic liver disease in many countries worldwide.\n NAFLD is already highly prevalent in the general population, and owing to a rising incidence of obesity and diabetes mellitus, the incidence of NAFLD and its impact on global healthcare are expected to increase in the future.\n A subset of patients with NAFLD develops progressive liver disease leading to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver failure.\n NAFLD has emerged as one of the leading causes of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in recent years.\n Moreover, HCC can occur in NAFLD even in absence of cirrhosis.\n Compared with the general population, NAFLD increases the risk of liver-related, cardiovascular and all-cause mortality.\n NAFLD is bidirectionally associated with metabolic syndrome.\n NAFLD increases the risk and contributes to aggravation of the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease.\n In addition, NAFLD is linked to colorectal polyps, polycystic ovarian syndrome, osteoporosis, obstructive sleep apnea, stroke, and various extrahepatic malignancies.\n Extended resection of steatotic liver is associated with increased risk of liver failure and mortality.\n There is an increasing trend of NAFLD-related cirrhosis requiring liver transplantation, and the recurrence of NAFLD in such patients is almost universal.\n This review discusses the growing burden of NAFLD, its outcomes, and adverse associations with various

in Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus?2 (SARS?CoV?2) Requiring Invasive Mechanical Ventilation","abstract":"Objective\nThe COVID?19 pandemic is rapidly spreading worldwide, notably in Europe and North America where obesity is highly prevalent.\n\n The relation between obesity and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus?2 (SARS?CoV?2) has not been fully documented.\n\n\nMethods\nThis retrospective cohort study analyzed the relationship between clinical characteristics, including BMI, and the requirement for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) in 124 consecutive patients admitted in intensive care for SARS?CoV?2 in a single French center.\n\n\nResults\nObesity (BMI?&gt;?30) and severe obesity (BMI?&gt;?35) were present in 47.6% and 28.2% of cases, respectively.\n\n Overall, 85 patients (68.6%) required IMV.\n\n The proportion of patients who required IMV increased with BMI categories (P?&lt;?0.01, ?2 test for trend), and it was greatest in patients with BMI?&gt;?35 (85.7%).\n\n In multivariate logistic regression, the need for IMV was significantly associated with male sex (P?&lt;?0.05) and BMI (P?&lt;?0.05), independent of age, diabetes, and hypertension.\n\n The odds ratio for IMV in patients with BMI?&gt;?35 versus patients with BMI?&lt;?25 was 7.36 (1.63?33.14; P?=?0.02).\n\n\nConclusions\nThe present study showed a high frequency of obesity among patients admitted in intensive care for SARS?CoV?2. Disease severity increased with BMI.\n\n Obesity is a risk factor for SARS?CoV?2 severity, requiring increased attention to preventive measures in susceptible individuals.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7262326","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley and Sons

coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is highly transmissible and pathogenic for humans and may cause life-threatening disease and mortality, especially in individuals with underlying comorbidities.\n First identified in an outbreak in Wuhan, China, COVID-19 is affecting more than 185 countries and territories around the world, with more than 15,754,651 confirmed cases and more than 640,029 deaths.\n Since December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 transmission has become a global threat, which includes confirmed cases in all 50 states within the United States (US).\n As of 25 July 2020, the Johns Hopkins Whiting School of Engineering Center for Systems Science and Engineering reports more than 4,112,651 cases and 145,546 deaths.\n To date, health disparities are associated with COVID-19 mortality among underserved populations.\n Here, the author explores potential underlying reasons for reported disproportionate, increased risks of mortality among African Americans and Hispanics/Latinos with COVID-19 compared with non-Hispanic Whites.\n The author examines the underlying clinical implications that may predispose minority populations and the adverse clinical outcomes that may contribute to increased risk of mortality.\n Government and community-based strategies to safeguard minority populations at risk for increased morbidity and mortality are essential.\n Underserved populations living in poverty with limited access to social services across the US are more likely to have underlying medical conditions and are among the most vulnerable.\n Societal and cultural barriers for ethnic minorities to achieve health equity are systemic issues that may be addressed only through shifts in governmental policies, producing long-overdue, substantive changes to end health care inequities.\n","id":"PMC7466083","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"Donald

positioning when users opt to geotag their tweets with their current location.\n We analyse a Twitter dataset with more than six million geotagged tweets posted in Australia, and we demonstrate that Twitter can be a reliable source for studying human mobility patterns.\n Our analysis shows that geotagged tweets can capture rich features of human mobility, such as the diversity of movement orbits among individuals and of movements within and between cities.\n We also find that short- and long-distance movers both spend most of their time in large metropolitan areas, in contrast with intermediate-distance movers’ movements, reflecting the impact of different modes of travel.\n Our study provides solid evidence that Twitter can indeed be a useful proxy for tracking and predicting human movement.\n","id":"PMC4496063","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

alternative approaches could provide necessary information efficiently to aid policy makers and health bodies when dealing with a pandemic.\n The following work presents a methodology by which Twitter data surrounding the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK is harvested and analysed using two main approaches.\n The first is an investigation into localized outbreak predictions by developing a prototype early-warning system using the distribution of total tweet volume.\n The temporal lag between the rises in the number of COVID-19 related tweets and officially reported deaths by Public Health England (PHE) is observed to be 6–27 days for various UK cities which matches the temporal lag values found in the literature.\n To better understand the topics of discussion and attitudes of people surrounding the pandemic, the second approach is an in-depth behavioural analysis assessing the public opinion and response to government policies such as the introduction of face-coverings.\n Using topic modelling, nine distinct topics are identified within the corpus of COVID-19 tweets, of which the themes ranged from retail to government bodies.\n Sentiment analysis on a subset of mask related tweets revealed sentiment spikes corresponding to major news and announcements.\n A Named Entity Recognition (NER) algorithm is trained and applied in a semi-supervised manner to recognise tweets containing location keywords within the unlabelled corpus and achieved a precision of 81.6%.\n Overall, these approaches allowed extraction of temporal trends relating to PHE case numbers, popular locations in relation to the use of face-coverings, and attitudes towards face-coverings, vaccines and the national ‘Test and Trace’

type I interferon activity and inflammatory responses in severe COVID-19 patients","abstract":"Interferons (IFNs) are central to antiviral immunity.\n Viral recognition elicits IFN production, which in turn triggers the transcription of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), which engage in various antiviral functions.\n Type I IFNs (IFN-? and IFN-?) are widely expressed and can result in immunopathology during viral infections.\n By contrast, type III IFN (IFN-?) responses are primarily restricted to mucosal surfaces and are thought to confer antiviral protection without driving damaging proinflammatory responses.\n Accordingly, IFN-? has been proposed as a therapeutic in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and other such viral respiratory diseases (see the Perspective by Grajales-Reyes and Colonna).\n Broggi et al.\n report that COVID-19 patient morbidity correlates with the high expression of type I and III IFNs in the lung.\n Furthermore, IFN-? secreted by dendritic cells in the lungs of mice exposed to synthetic viral RNA causes damage to the lung epithelium, which increases susceptibility to lethal bacterial superinfections.\n Similarly, using a mouse model of influenza infection, Major et al.\n found that IFN signaling (especially IFN-?) hampers lung repair by inducing p53 and inhibiting epithelial proliferation and differentiation.\n Complicating this picture, Hadjadj et al.\n observed that peripheral blood immune cells from severe and critical COVID-19 patients have diminished type I IFN and enhanced proinflammatory interleukin-6– and tumor necrosis factor-?–fueled responses.\n This suggests that in contrast to local production, systemic production of IFNs may be beneficial.\n The results of this trio of studies suggest that the location, timing, and duration of IFN exposure are critical parameters underlying the success or failure of therapeutics for viral respiratory

Administration has authorized the emergency use of this drug when clinical trials are unavailable or infeasible.\n\n Hydroxychloroquine, alone or in combination with azithromycin, is being widely used in Covid-19 therapy based on anecdotal and limited observational evidence.\n\n\nMETHODS:\nid='P2'>We performed a retrospective analysis of data from patients hospitalized with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in all United States Veterans Health Administration medical centers until April 11, 2020. Patients were categorized based on their exposure to hydroxychloroquine alone (HC) or with azithromycin (HC+AZ) as treatments in addition to standard supportive management for Covid-19. The two primary outcomes were death and the need for mechanical ventilation.\n\n We determined the association between treatment and the primary outcomes using competing risk hazard regression adjusting for clinical characteristics via propensity scores.\n\n Discharge and death were taken into account as competing risks and subdistribution hazard ratios are presented.\n\n\nRESULTS:\nid='P3'>A total of 368 patients were evaluated (HC, n=97; HC+AZ, n=113; no HC, n=158).\n\n Rates of death in the HC, HC+AZ, and no HC groups were 27.8%, 22.1%, 11.4%, respectively.\n\n Rates of ventilation in the HC, HC+AZ, and no HC groups were 13.3%, 6.9%, 14.1%, respectively.\n\n Compared to the no HC group, the risk of death from any cause was higher in the HC group (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.61; 95% CI, 1.10 to 6.17; P=0.03) but not in the HC+AZ group (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.56 to 2.32; P=0.72).\n\n The risk of ventilation was similar in the HC group (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.43; 95% CI, 0.53 to 3.79; P=0.48) and in the HC+AZ group (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.16 to 1.12; P=0.09), compared to the no HC group.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\nid='P4'>In this study, we found no evidence that use of hydroxychloroquine, either with or without azithromycin, reduced the risk of mechanical ventilation in patients hospitalized with Covid-19.

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

Older age, higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, d-dimer levels, comorbidities, lymphocytopenia and elevated alanine aminotransferase, high-sensitive cardiac troponin I were reported to be associated with mortality. However, no published works were found to establish a scoring system to predict in-hospital deaths for patients with severe COVID-19.\nAdded value of this study\nIn this retrospective cohort study from three hospitals in Wuhan, China, we found that old age, coronary heart disease condition, percentage of lymphocytes &lt;8%, procalcitonin&gt;0 15 ng/ml and D-dimer &gt;0 5 ug/ml were independent risk factors for mortality. Based on the above variables, a scoring system of COVID-19 (CSS) was established to divide patients into low-risk and high-risk groups. This model displayed good discrimination (AUC=0 919) and calibration (P=0 264). Complications in low-risk and high-risk groups were significantly different (P&lt;0 05). Use of corticosteroids in low-risk groups increased hospital stays by 4 5 days (P=0 036) and durations of disease by 7 5 days (P=0 012) compared with no corticosteroids.\nImplications of all the available evidence\nOld age, coronary heart disease condition, lymphopenia, elevated procalcitonin and D-dimer were independently related to mortality. CSS was useful for predicting in-hospital mortality and complications, and it could help clinicians to identify high-risk patients with poor outcomes.\nAlt-text: Unlabelled box\nIntroduction\nIn December 2019 a group of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause were later confirmed to be infected with a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. The clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infection appeared to be wide, ranging from asymptomatic infection, mild upper respiratory tract illness to severe or even fatal in some cases. To accommodate the wide spectrum of clinical presentations and outcomes of infections caused by SARS-CoV-2, the WHO later introduced a rather unspecific name COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 19) to denote this disease.\nThe rapid emergence of COVID-19 in Wuhan city, Hubei Province, China, has resulted in thousands of deaths. Recently, the COVID-19 spread rapidly around the world and caused the death of hundreds of thousands of patients. At present, there are no effective therapies or vaccines for COVID-19. It was reported that the death was mainly in severe patients, and many infected patients presented mild flu-like symptoms and quickly recover. However, the differences in clinical characteristics between severe and non-severe cases were little reported. In particular, the comparison of clinical characteristics between survivors and non-survivors of severe patients and risk factors for survival have not been reported.\nIn this study, we aimed to identify risk factors for mortality of severe patients and establish a risk model to predict mortality, so that clinicians can effectively consider medical resources of patients with different risks.\nMethods\nPatients\nThis retrospective cohort study included three institutions: Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, No. 7 Hospital of Wuhan and Leishenshan Hospital (Wuhan, China). Zhongnan Hospital is responsible for the treatments for COVID-19 assigned by the government. No. 7 Hospital of Wuhan is one of the designated hospitals for the hospitalization of patients with COVID-19 and has been entrusted by Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University since January 2020. Leishenshan Hospital was a hospital specially built to treat patients with COVID-19 and was taken over by the Zhongnna hospital of Wuhan University. All consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 according to WHO interim guidance from January 1 to March 27, 2020 were enrolled in present study. Patients absent of or with negative SARS-CoV-2 test results were excluded from this study. All patients involved in this study were living in Wuhan during the outbreak period of COVID-19. The clinical outcomes such as discharges or mortality were monitored up to March 31, 2020, the final date of follow-up, and all patients with COVID-19 have experienced a definite outcome. This study was conducted according to the principles of Helsinki and approved by the Ethics Committee of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University (No. 2020074).\nData collection\nEpidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological characteristics, treatment and outcomes data were obtained from electronic medical records with standardized data collection forms. The data were reviewed by a trained team of physicians. COVID-19 was defined as a positive result on high throughput sequencing or real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay of nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens. The targeted region of RT-PCR for viral RNA detection included open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) and nucleocapsid protein (N). Target 1 (ORF1ab): forward primer CCCTGTGGGTTTTACACTTAA; reverse primer ACGATTGTGCATCAGCTGA; and the probe 5'-VIC-CCGTCTGCGGTATGTGGAAAGGTTATGG-BHQ1-3'. Target 2 (N): forward primer GGGGAACTTCTCCTGCTAGAAT; reverse primer CAGACATTTTGCTCTCAAGCTG; and the probe 5'-FAM- TTGCTGCTGCTTGACAGATT-TAMRA-3'. Radiologic assessments included chest radiography or computed tomography (CT). Laboratory examinations consisted of complete blood count, serum biochemical tests (including liver and renal function, creatine kinase MB isoenzyme and electrolytes), coagulation profile, C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT). Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (IgG and IgM) were also tracked. IgM and IgG antibodies were measured with COVID-19 IgM/IgG chemiluminescence test kit (Shenzhen Yahuilong Biotechnology Co., Ltd., China). Tests were performed on iFlash 3000 automated analyzer. The durations from illness onset to complications, hospital admission, discharged or death were recorded. The criteria for discharge were absence of fever for at least 3 days, substantial improvement in both lungs in chest CT, clinical remission of respiratory symptoms, and two throat-swab samples negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA obtained at least 24 h apart.\nDefinitions\nFever was defined as axillary temperature of 37 3  C or higher. Septic shock was defined according to the 2016 Third International Consensus Definition. Acute kidney injury (AKI) was identified according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes definition. Acute liver injury (ALI) was defined if liver enzymes or bilirubin were more than twice the upper limit of normal. Acute myocardial injury (AMI) was defined if the serum levels of cardiac biomarkers were above the 99th percentile upper reference limit or new abnormalities were shown in electrocardiography and echocardiography. Coagulopathy was defined as a 3-s extension of prothrombin time or a 5-s extension of activated partial thromboplastin time. The illness severity of COVID-19 was defined according to the Chinese management guideline for COVID-19 (version 7 0). COVID-19 patients are stratified as follows: mild (i.e., mild clinical symptoms without imaging feature of pneumonia), ordinary (i.e., clinical symptoms such as fever, cough, with imaging feature of pneumonia), severe (i.e., dyspnea, respiratory frequency &gt;=30/min, blood oxygen saturation &lt;=93%, partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio &lt; 300, and/or lung infiltrates &gt; 50% within 24 to 48 h), and critical ill cases (i.e., respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction or failure). In this analysis, severe cases included the severe and critical ill classification in the 7th Edition. Survival time was defined as from illness onset to death.\nStatistical analysis\nNormality of distribution of continuous variables was tested by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. We used the Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test for categorical variables and t or Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables to compare differences between survivors and non-survivors by IBM SPSS statistics software, version 25 0. The cut-off value of continuous variables was defined based on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve with optimal sensitivity and specificity. In training cohort, there are few missing values for each variable, and the proportion of missing values does not exceed 10%, so multiple imputation methods were applied to supplement missing values to obtain complete data using &quot;mice&quot; package with R version 3 6 3 software. Then the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was performed to identify variables with non-zero coefficients using package of &quot;glmnet&quot;. The coefficients and multivariable analyses were used to generate a prediction model. To quantify discrimination performance of the model, ROC curve was measured with &quot;rms&quot; package in R software. By comparing observed actual data with the predicted probability of the model, calibration curves were plotted, accompanied with the Hosmer-Lemeshow test. Cumulative risk events were estimated in training and independent validation cohort using the Kaplan-Meier method in high- and low-risk groups and the log-rank test to assess statistical significance of the difference. All reported P values were two-sided at significance-level of 0 05.\nRole of the funding source\nThis work was supported by the Key Project for Anti-2019 novel Coronavirus Pneumonia from the Ministry of Science and Technology, China (grant number 2020YFC0845500).\nResults\nDemographics and clinical characteristics of total patients\nDemographic and laboratory findings in patients with COVID-19 on admission in training cohort.\nTable 1	 	\nCharacteristics	Severe patients (n=113) No (%) or Median (IQR)	Presence of severe	P	 	Cut off value		Survivors (n=64) No (%) or Median (IQR)	Non-survivors (n=49) No (%) or Median (IQR)		 	General characteristics					 	Sex				0 085	 	Male	73(64 6)	37(57 8)	36(73 5)		 	Female	40(35 4)	27(42 2)	13(26 5)		 	Age (years)	66 0(57 5-73 5)	62 0(53 0-71 0)	73 0(64 5-79 0)	&lt;0 001	 	&lt;60 0	31(27 4)	26(40 6)	5(10 2)	&lt;0 001	 	60 0-75 0	58(51 3)	33(51 6)	25(51 0)		 	&gt;75 0	24(21 2)	5(7 8)	19(38 8)		 	Routine peripheral blood					 	WBC (x 109)	5 2(3 7-8 5)	4 5(3 2-7 6)	7 0(4 7-10 5)	0 001	 	&lt;3 5	23(20 9)	18(28 6)	5(10 6)	0 004	 	3 5-9 5	64(58 2)	38(60 3)	26 (55 3)		 	&gt;9 5	23(20 9)	7(11 1)	16(34 0)		 	Neu (x 109)	4.0(2 5-7.4)	3 2 (2 2-5 3)	5 2(3 3-8 6)	0 001	 	&gt;6 3	34(30 9)	13(21 6)	21(44 7)	0 007	 	Neu% (%)	78 5(68 3-88 6)	75 1(64 4-83 3)	87 1(73 9-91 7)	0 001	 	&gt;85 0	39(35 8)	12(19 4)	27(57 4)	&lt;0 001	 	Lym(x 109)	0 7(0 5-1 0)	0 7(0 6-1 0)	0 6(0 4-1 0)	0113	 	&lt;0 5	29(26 4)	8(12 7)	21(44 7)	&lt;0 001	 	Lym% (%)	13 6(6 3-21 6)	16 4(10 3-25 1)	7 5(4 7-16 6)	&lt;0 001	 	&lt;8 0	35(31 8)	10(15 9)	25(53 2)	&lt;0 001	 	Mon (x 109)	0 4(0 2-0 5)	0 4(0 2-0 5)	0 4(0 3-0 5)	0 929	 	0 1-0 6	88(80 7)	52(83 9)	36(76 6)	0 340	 	Mon% (%)	6 2(4 3-9 7)	7 5(5 0-10 7)	5 0(3 5-6 9)	0 001	 	&lt;=6 0	52(47 7)	21(33 9)	31(66 0)	0 001	 	HGB (g/L)	129 0(119 0-139 2)	131 4(121 3-139 1)	129 0(117 8-140 0)	0 483	 	Anemia	42(38 5)	21(33 9)	21(44 7)	0 251	 	PLT (x 109)	151 5(118 0-204 0)	160 0(121 0-237 0)	142 0(114 0-181 0)	0 155	 	&lt;150 0	55(50 0)	28(44 4)	27(57 4)	0 177	 	Blood biochemical examination					 	ALT (IU/L)	34 0(20 0-47 0)	28 0(18 5-41 5)	35 5(25 0-48 8)	0 078	 	&gt;40 0	32(29 9)	15(24 6)	17(37 0)	0 167	 	AST (IU/L)	35 5(25 0-59 3)	31 0(22 5-62 5)	40 0(29 8-57 0)	0 182	 	&gt;40 0	42(39 6)	22(36 7)	20(43 5)	0 477	 	TP (g/L)	64 4(60 2-68 6)	65 0(60 8-70 9)	63 8(59 0-66 2)	0 074	 	&lt;65 0	62(55 4)	32(50 0)	30(62 5)	0 188	 	Albumin (g/L)	35 1(31 9-38 7)	37 0(33 1-39 7)	33 4(29 7-36 8)	0 003	 	&lt;35 0	55(49 1)	25(39 1)	30(62 5)	0 014	 	Globulin (g/L)	28 8(26 6-32 2)	28 5(25 7-31 8)	29 4(27 7-32 6)	0 119	 	&gt;30 0	44(39 3)	21(32 8)	23(47 9)	0 105	 	UA (umol/L)	251 3(212 4-371 2)	245 0(202 6-319 2)	288 0(230 0-415 6)	0 052	 	&gt;428 0	16(14 5)	7(11 1)	9(19 1)	0 237	 	CREA (umol/L)	70 0(57 7-89 4)	70 0(55 0-81 7)	73 0(64 5-106 4)	0 046	 	&gt;133 0	7(6 4)	2(3 2)	5(10 6)	0 233	 	Urea (mmol/L)	5 8(4 3-8 7)	5 0(4 0-6 2)	8 4(5 8-14 3)	&lt;0 001	 	&gt;7 6	39(35 3)	11(17 5)	28(59 6)	&lt;0 001	 	Inflammatory indicators and coagulation function					 	PCT (ng/ml)	0 09(0 05-0 2)	0 05(0 04-0 1)	0 2(0 09-0 7)	&lt;0 001	 	&gt;0 15	33(31 7)	5(8 5)	28(62 2)	&lt;0 001	 	CRP (mg/L)	57 4(25 1-101 6)	42 9(21 3-68 3)	83 5(38 8-165 5)	&lt;0 001	 	&gt;55 0	54(52 4)	22(37 9)	32(71 1)	0 001	 	CKMB (ng/ml)	13 2(5 5-21 3)	9 6(3 1-15 2)	17 0(12 2-26 9)	&lt;0 001	 	&gt;15 0	41(40 2)	14(24 6)	27(60 0)	&lt;0 001	 	D-dimer (ug/ml)	0 4(0 2-2 8)	0 23(0 15-0 40)	3 4(0 5-16 7)	&lt;0 001	 	&gt;0 5	42(44 2)	12(22 2)	30(73 2)	&lt;0 001	 	TT (s)	14 7(13 8-15 8)	14 6(13 7-15 3)	14 7(14 1-17 1)	0 057	 	&gt;16 8	12(11 9)	2(3 4)	10(23 3)	0 002	 	PT (s)	13 1(12 3-13 8)	13 1(12 3-13 6)	13 3(12 2-14 9)	0 339	 	&gt;12 5	60(59 4)	35(60 3)	25(58 1)	0 823	 	\nALT, Alanine aminotransferase;

A total of 1830 cases with complete data and defined outcomes were included, among of which 452 cases (26.7%) were severe. The severe patients have relatively high mortality rates in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University (39.1%) and No. 7 Hospital of Wuhan (46.3%), while the mortality rate in Leishenshan Hospital (8.8%) is lower. Therefore, 113 severe patients from Zhongnan Hospital and No. 7 Hospital of Wuhan were included as training cohort to compare the characteristics of survivors and non-survivors, while 339 from Leishenshan Hospital were assigned to independent validation cohort. The demographic and clinical characteristics were shown in Tables 1, 2 and S1.\nIn training cohort, there were 49 non-survivors during hospitalization. The median age of severe patients was 66 years (Range: 24-96 years; interquartile ranges: 57 5-73 5 years), while it was 73 0 years for the non-survivors. The number of men was more than women (Table 1). Patients aged 60-75 years accounted for the largest proportion, with a proportion of 51 3%. Among the population in training cohort, 72 (63 7%) patients had at least one underlying comorbidity, the most common of which were hypertension (44 2%) followed by coronary heart disease (24 8%) and diabetes (17 7%) (Table 2). The coronary heart disease (CHD) or diabetes had statistical differences between survivors and non-survivors. All severe COVID-19 had abnormal radiologic findings on chest in present study. Nineteen patients (18 3%) had co-infection with the virus on admission, of which Influenza B co-infection (7.6%) was the most common (Table 2).\nThe treatment and outcomes of severe COVID-19\nComparisons of outcomes and durations between survivors and non-survivors or different risk group in patients with severe COVID-19.\nTable 3	 	\nCharacteristics	Patients (n=113) No. (%) or Median (rang)	Presence of severe	P	Hazard subgroup	P	 			Survivors (n=64) No. (%) or Median (rang)	Non-survivors (n=49) No. (%) or Median (rang)		Low risk (n=60) No. (%) or Median (rang)	High risk (n=53) No. (%) or Median (rang)		 	Complications-n (%)								 	Sepsis	9(8 0)	0	9(18 4)	0 001	3(5 0)	6(11 3)	0 373	 	Respiratory failure	47(41 6)	7(10 9)	40(81 6)	&lt;0 001	6(10 0)	41(77 4)	&lt;0 001	 	Acute myocardial injury	44(38 9)	7(10 9)	37(75 5)	&lt;0 001	8(13 3)	36(67 9)	&lt;0 001	 	Acute kidney injury	26(23 0)	6(9 4)	20(40 8)	&lt;0 001	6(10 0)	20(37 7)	&lt;0 001	 	Acute liver injury	29(25 7)	8(12 5)	21(42 9)	&lt;0 001	9(15 0)	20(37 7)	0 006	 	Acidosis	21(18 6)	0	21(42 9)	&lt;0 001	3(5 0)	18(34 0)	&lt;0 001	 	Secondary infection	19(16 8)	6(9 4)	13(26 5)	0 016	5(8 3)	14(26 4)	0 010	 	Coagulopathy	21(18 6)	4(6 3)	17(34 7)	&lt;0 001	7(11 7)	14(26 4)	0 044	 	Durations-median (rang)								 	Time from illness onset to admission	7 0(0-41 0)	7 0(1 0-41 0)	8 0(0-30 0)	0 958	7 0(1 0-41 0)	8 0(0-30 0)	0 411	 	Time from illness onset to death or discharge	26 0(2 0-67 0)	30 0(11 0-67 0)	21 0(2 0-54 0)	&lt;0 001	30 0(11 0-67 0)	22 0(2 0-52 0)	0 005	 	Time from illness onset to sepsis	22 0(8 0-31 0)	NA	22 0(8 0-31 0)	-	25 0(22 0-31 0)	21 5(8 0-28 0)	0 262	 	Time from illness onset to respiratory failure	11 0(2 0-35 0)	12 0(8 0-33 0)	10 0(2 0-35 0)	0 256	14 0(11 0-33 0)	10 0(2 0-35 0)	0 056	 	Time from illness onset to acute myocardial injury	14 5(2 0-34 0)	14 0(7 0-25 0)	15 0(2 0-34 0)	0 950	17 0(8 0-26 0)	13 5(2 0-34 0)	0 247	 	Time from illness onset to acute kidney injury	16 5(2 0-52 0)	11 5(2 0-52 0)	17 0(2 0-37 0)	0 355	16 5(2 0-52 0)	16 5(2 0-37 0)	0 929	 	Time from illness onset to acute liver injury	16 0(2 0-39 0)	13 0(4 0-31 0)	17 0(2 0-39 0)	0 301	17 0(4 0-31 0)	12 0(2 0-39 0)	0 871	 	Time from illness onset to acidosis	19 0(5 0-35 0)	NA	19 0(5 0-35 0)	-	18 0(17 0-20 0)	19 0(5 0-35 0)	0 814	 	Time from illness onset to secondary infection	13 0(4 0-25 0)	12 0(4 0-25 0)	13 0(4 0-25 0)	0 701	10 0(4 0-25 0)	14 5(4 0-25 0)	0 500	 	Time from illness onset to coagulopathy	19 0(4 0-41 0)	14 5(11 0-22 0)	20 0(4 0-41 0)	0 144	17 0(11 0-27 0)	20 5(4 0-41 0)	0 322	 	\nFor treatment, 109 (96 5%) patients received antibiotics and 97 (85 8%) received antiviral drugs (Table 2). Intravenous immunoglobulin use was in 24 8%. Systematic corticosteroid application accounted for 54.7% in survivors, while it was 81.6% in non-survivors (P=0 003). The comparison of treatment, and outcomes in training cohort were shown in Tables 2 and 3. Respiratory failure (41 6%) was the most frequently observed complication, followed by AMI (38 9%), ALI (25 7%) and AKI (23 0%) (Table 3). The secondary infection occurred in 16 8% patients. Sepsis and acidosis all occurred in non-survivors. The frequency of complications was higher in non-survivors than survivors (all P&lt;0 05, Table 3).\nDynamic profile of complication, clinical course, and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody.

The bars represent median with interquartile range.\nFig 1\nMedian time from illness onset to admission was similar in survivors and non-survivors (P=0 958) with a median duration of 7 0 days (1 0-41 0) for survivors and 8 0 days (0-30 0) for non-survivors (Table 3). The median time from illness onset to discharge was 30 0 days (Range: 11 0-67 0; interquartile ranges: 23 0-38 0) for survivors, whereas the median time to death was 21 0 days (Range: 2 0-54 0; interquartile ranges: 15 0-31 5) for non-survivors (P&lt;0 01). The median time from illness onset to complication had no statistical differences between survivors and non-survivors (all P&gt;0 05, Table 3). Median time from illness onset to progression of respiratory failure was 11 0 days, followed by secondary infection (13 0 days), AMI (14.5 days), ALI (16 0 days), AKI (16 5 days), acidosis (19 0 days), coagulopathy (19 0 days) and sepsis (22 0 days) (Table 3, Fig. 1(A)). Among non-survivors, the median time from illness onset to admission, from admission to progression of complication, from complication occurred to death was shown in Fig. 1(B). The median time from coagulopathy or acidosis to death was the shortest (3 days), followed by AKI, ALI, AMI, sepsis, respiratory failure and secondary infection.\nTemporal profiles of serum antibody responses\nOf cases from Zhongnan Hospital, 56 non-severe serums and 15 severe serums were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies from patients with COVID-19. The IgG and IgM levels of severe and non-severe patients were shown in Fig. 1(C) and (D). The maximum time for antibody monitoring was up to 54 days from illness onset. Antibody levels between severe and non-severe patients had no statistical differences (P=0.179 for IgG, P=0.926 for IgM). IgG levels reached the highest during 20-30 days both in severe and non-severe COVID-19 patients. In severe patients, the level of IgG gradually declined after 30 days, while in non-severe patients it remained stable. The IgM levels stabilized at low levels in non-severe patients, whereas it gradually increased after 30 days from the onset of symptoms in severe patients, and then declined after 50 days.\nRisk factors and prediction model for death in severe cases\nClinical feature selection using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) binary logistic regression model and multivariable analysis in the training cohort. Eight variables selected by LASSO binary logistic regression analysis. Two dotted vertical lines mark the optimal values by minimum criteria and 1-s.e. criteria (A).

The score of each variable (D).\nFig 2\nIn total, 52 characteristics were analyzed by LASSO binary logistic regression in training cohort, and 8 candidate variables that were reliably associated with survival were selected (Fig. 2). The weight for each factor associated with infection were obtained by calculating coefficients when log(lambda)=-2 475 and lambda=0 0841 from LASSO binary logistic regression model (Fig. 2(A) and (B)). The coefficients for each parameter were as follows: 0 4565 for Age, 0 0997 for diabetes, 0 2487 for CHD, 0 1760 for percentage of lymphocytes (LYM%),&lt;8%, 1 371 for PCT&gt;0 15 ng/ml, 0 2150 for blood urea nitrogen (BUN)&gt;7 6 mmol/L, 0 0815 for C reactive protein (CRP) &gt;55 mg/L and 0 5865 for D-dimer (DD) &gt;0 5 ug/ml. Then, by multivariable analysis, Age, CHD, LYM%, PCT and DD remained independent risk factors for mortality, and hazard ratios (HRs) of the five variables were shown in Fig. 2(C).\nAccording to multivariable analysis and coefficients of Lasso binary logistic regression, a scoring system of COVID-19 (CSS) was generated as shown in Fig. 2(D). The score distributions were as follows: age between 60 and 75 points was 1 point, and those older than 75 was 2 points, CHD condition was 1 point, LYM% &lt;8% was 1 point, PCT&gt;0 15 ng/ml was 2 points and DD&gt;0 5 ug/ml was 1 point. We then defined a total of 0 to 2 points as low risk, and total points more than 2 as high risk. The cut-off value between these groups was selected based on the best sensitivity/specificity ratio.\nPerformance of the prediction model in the training and independent validation cohort\nThe performance of the scoring system to predict mortality of severe COVID-19 patients. ROC curves and AUCs to assess the prediction accuracy in the training cohort (A) and the independent validation cohort (D). Calibration curves of the model in the training cohort (B) and the independent validation cohort (E).

Performance of this model was validated by calibration plots for the probability of death, which demonstrated good agreement between prediction and actual observation in training cohort (Fig. 3(B)). The Hosmer-Lemeshow test yielded a nonsignificant statistic (P=0 264), indicating that there was no departure from perfect fit. For illustration, the cumulative risk events were performed in training and independent validation cohorts, which showed significantly increased deaths in high-risk group compared with the low-risk group (Fig. 3(C) and (F)).\nPredictive value of COVID-19 scoring system\nComparison of durations in different risk groups between groups with corticosteroids and without corticosteroids. Comparison of hospitalization days in different risk groups between groups with corticosteroids and without corticosteroids (A). The bars represent mean with Standard Error of Mean (SEM). Comparison of survival time in different risk groups between groups with corticosteroids and without corticosteroids (B). The bars represent median with interquartile range.\nFig 4\nIn low-risk group, the number of patients was 60 with 6 non-survivors, and in high-risk group, the number of patients was 53 with 43 non-survivors. The mortality rates were 10 0% in low-risk group and 81 1% in high-risk group (P&lt;0 01). There were also statistical differences in complications in low-risk and high-risk groups except for sepsis. In low-risk group, the median time from illness to death was 34 5 days, whereas it was 21 0 days in high-risk group (P=0 039, Fig. 4(B)), indicating that low-risk patients had a longer survival time. For survivors, the median time from illness to discharge was 20 0 days for low-risk group, and 22 5 for high-risk group (P=0 125, Fig. 4(B)). In low-risk group, 30 survivors received systemic corticosteroids treatment and 24 survivors did not, whose mean hospital durations were 23 0 days and 18 5 days respectively (P=0 036, Fig. 4(A)), and the median time from illness onset to discharge was 34 5 days and 27 0 days (P=0 012, Fig. 4(B)). In high-risk group, 34 non-survivors received systemic corticosteroids treatment and 9 non-survivors did not, and their median survival time were 21 0 days and 15 0 days respectively (P=0 475, Fig. 4(B)). In conclusion, in low-risk group, the absence of systemic corticosteroids could shorten duration of disease by 7 5 days and hospital duration by 4 5 days, meanwhile, whether to use of systemic corticosteroids in high-risk group had no effect on survival.\nDynamic profile of points and comparison of scores between admission and outcomes in severe COVID-19 patients\nDynamic profile of points and comparison of scores between admission and outcomes in severe COVID-19. Dynamic profile of points in non-survivors and survivors (A). The bars represent mean with Standard Error of Mean (SEM). Comparison of scores between admission and discharge or death in severe COVID-19 patients (B).\nFig 5\nData from 20 patients with complete clinical course (including 10 severe survivors, 10 severe non-survivors) were analyzed to track scores from admission to discharge or death (Fig. 5(A)). Among survivors, scores gradually decreased during hospitalization until discharge, whereas scores gradually increased until death in non-survivors. Meanwhile, the last laboratory findings with LYM%, DD, PCT were recorded to obtain discharge or death scores. Finally, 36 non-survivors and 36 survivors were included to compare scores between admission and discharge or death (Fig. 5(B)). For non-survivors, scores at death was higher than that at admission (P&lt;0.0001). For survivors, scores at discharge seemed lower than that at admission, but the difference was not statistically significant (P=0.080).\nDiscussion\nIn this retrospective cohort study, the median time from illness onset to death was 21 0 days for severe COVID-19 non-survivors. A total of 60 2% patients had complications, and the proportion in non-survivors was higher than that of survivors (P&lt;0 05). It was reported that organ damage during hospitalization in patients with COVID-19 was associated with in-hospital mortality. Respiratory failure (41 6%) was the most common complication followed by AMI (38 9%), ALI (25 7%) and AKI (23 0%). For non-survivors, respiratory failure and secondary infection occurred firstly, followed by AMI, AKI, ALI. AMI occurred earlier than AKI and ALI, and that heart becomes the first organ involved might be explained by the fact that the cardiac highly expressed angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) which was a human cell receptor with a strong binding affinity to the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, leading to directly attacked by the virus. COVID-19-induced kidney and liver injury might be related to drug hepatotoxicity or subsequent immune-mediated inflammation, such as cytokine storm, pneumonia-associated hypoxia and shock. It was worth noting that time from AKI to death was shorter than that of AMI or ALI. Cui and co-workers indicated that cytopathic effects of SARS-CoV-2 on podocytes and proximal straight tubule cells may cause AKI in patients with COVID-19. The early monitoring of renal function should be paid more attention.\nThe study identified several factors associated with mortality in severe patients with COVID-19. The aged, CHD condition, decreased LYM%, elevated levels of PCT and DD on admission were associated with high odds of in-hospital death. All non-survivors scored no less than 3 points before death, and dynamic profile of points showed that a high score indicated progression of disease and a higher risk of death (Fig. 5). CSS was established to divide mortality risk of severe cases into high-risk and low-risk groups. The risk of death in high-risk group increased significantly (P&lt;0 01), and there were also statistical differences in complications between low-risk and high-risk group. The CSS demonstrated good predictive performance with ROC curve (AUC=0 919 in training cohort and 0 938 in independent validation cohort) and Calibration curve (P=0 264 in training cohort) analysis. In validation cohort, CSS seemed to underestimate mortality of low-risk patients but overestimate mortality of high-risk patients in the calibration curve (Fig. 3(D)). It could be explained by the low mortality rate in Wuhan Leishenshan Hospital since some critically ill patients were transferred to other hospitals to reduce mortality, which lead to the predicted death inconsistent with the actual observed death. The data from Wuhan Leishenshan Hospital might not reflect the actual mortality rate of severe COVID-19 in Wuhan or China.\nThe elderly was considered an important independent predictor of mortality in SARS and MERS, and also has been confirmed to be associated with mortality in patients with COVID-19, which was also confirmed in current study. The mortality rate was the highest in patients with severe COVID-19 older than 75 years (79 2%), followed by patients aged 60-75 years old (43 1%) and younger than 60 years (16 1%). It was worth noting that the number of patients aged 60-75 years was the largest (Table 1). The elderly patients with COVID-19 deserved special attention.\nMyocardial injury was reported to be a common complication and significantly associated with fatal outcome of COVID-19. Lu et al. demonstrated that patients with underlying cardiovascular disease including CHD was more prone to experience myocardial injury during the course of COVID-19 and higher risk of death. CHD has also been found to be associated with acute cardiac events and poor outcomes in influenza and other respiratory viral infections. In present study, CHD was one of independent risk factors to patients with COVID-19. The mechanism might be that the release of inflammatory cytokines after infection probably caused reduction in coronary blood flow, decreased in oxygen supply, destabilization of coronary plaque, and microthrombogenesis, leading to myocardial injury and heart failure.\nThe majority of patients died of multiple organ failure. Overexpression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines released by activated immune cells and infected cells was involved in the development of organ dysfunction in SARS patients and the COVID-19 mortality. In this analysis, PCT, one of the inflammatory indicators, had a strong correlation with mortality of severe COVID-19 patients, and D-dimer greater than 0 5 mug/mL was also associated with fatal outcome. Elevated D-dimer levels indicating the coagulation activation was considered to be related to sustained inflammatory response. Consequently, COVID-19 mortality might be due to virus-activated cytokine storm. It was valuable to incorporate inflammation indicators into the scoring system to predict the risk of mortality.\nLymphopenia was believed to be related to increased disease severity and decease in COVID-19 patients. Lymphocytopenia was also common in the critically ill patients with MERS infection, which was considered the result of lymphocytes apoptosis. Therefore, it could be postulated that necrosis or apoptosis of lymphocytes also induced lymphocytopenia in severe patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The severity of lymphocytopenia reflected the severity of COVID-19 and possessed the ability to predict mortality as a powerful predictor. Besides, the decreased LYM% partly reflected an increase in the proportion of neutrophils, which may be related to cytokine storm induced by virus invasion.\nThis analysis also tracked antibodies response in serum of patients with COVID-19, which was considered the longest tracking to our best knowledge. It can be seen from Fig. 1 that IgG reached its peak at about 20-30 days both in severe and non-severe COVID-19 patients. In severe patients, the level of IgG declined after 30 days, which might be due to lymphocyte depletion. That IgM levels were still high after 30 days from illness onset in severe patients might be explained that viruses existed in severe patients for a relatively long time. It was reported that the serum antibody in COVID-19 had potential diagnostic value, and a higher titer of antibody was independently associated with a worse clinical classification. But there was no statistically significant difference in antibody levels between severe and non-severe patients in this analysis. The number of severe cases was small in present study, which might result in less accurate results. More cases and time period tests are needed to verify.\nNo antiviral treatment for coronavirus infection has been proven to be effective. Given the high levels of cytokines induced by SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections, systemic corticosteroids were often used to treat severe patients, for possible benefit by reducing inflammatory-induced lung injury. However, it was controversial to use corticosteroids for treating influenza-associated pneumonia or ARDS. Several studies demonstrated the association of corticosteroid use with mortality, bacterial and fungal infection and the emergence of antiviral resistance. Some evidence show that receiving corticosteroids in patients with SARS and MERS did not have an effect on mortality, but rather delayed viral clearance. Further evidence was urgently needed to assess whether systematic corticosteroid treatment was beneficial or harmful for patients with COVID-193. In present cohort, 16 8% of severe COVID-19 patients had complications of secondary infection, but it was not associated with the use of corticosteroids, and the difference was not statistically significant (P=0 203). The secondary infection may be due to the immune deficiency caused by virus. In addition, whether to use corticosteroids had no effect on mortality, but the use of corticosteroids in low-risk group prolonged hospital stay by 4 5 days and durations by 7 5 days. The CSS provided some guidance for the rational application of corticosteroids and the applicable populations.\nOur study had several limitations. Firstly, only 113 severe patients with COVID-19 were included in the training cohort, and in independent validation group, the number of deaths was small. Larger cohort studies are needed to validate the scoring system we have established. Secondly, as a retrospective study, some possible risk factors reported by other studies such as lactate dehydrogenase, and interleukin 6 were not presented in the study because not all laboratory tests were done in all patients resulting in the incomplete data. Their role might be underestimated in predicting in-hospital death. It was reasonable to assume that other possible risk factors not included to analyses might be independently associated with in-hospital death, but the current model based on the five variables has shown good performance to predict clinical outcomes. Thirdly, since the vast majority of chest imaging findings were bilateral lung lesions, we only used the presence of lung lesions on admission as a positive indicator of chest imaging, without considering the severity of lungs, which may underestimate the role of lung lesions. A predictive model of combined lung lesions also needs to be evaluated. Finally, the data for score development and validation are entirely from Wuhan, China. Due to differences in medical resources, the data in this study may not be fully representative of the population in China or even the world, which could potentially limit the generalizability of the risk score in other areas of the world. Additional validation studies from areas outside China should be completed. However, in the absence of a severe COVID-19 death risk scoring system, this scoring system can help clinicians worldwide to judge in-hospital deaths.\nIn conclusion, complications were associated with mortality of COVID-19. The time from AKI to death was the shorter than that of ALI and AMI. Early monitoring of renal function should be paid more attention. The dynamic changes of antibodies were worth tracking, since a higher titer of antibody was considered to be independently associated with a worse clinical classification. We found that the aged, CHD condition, decreased percentage of lymphocyte, elevated D-dimer and PCT at admission were related to mortality of severe patients with COVID-19. The CSS well classified severe patients into low-risk and high-risk groups, which was helpful for predicting in-hospital mortality and complications. CSS could help clinicians to identify high-risk patients and be alert to the occurrence of complications.\nDeclaration of Competing Interest\nAll authors declare no competing interests.\nReferences\nThe novel coronavirus originating in Wuhan, China: challenges for global health governance\nThe species severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus: classifying 2019-nCoV and naming it SARS-CoV-2\nClinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China\nClinical characteristics of 138 hospitalized patients with 2019 novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia in Wuhan, China\nEpidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study\nCoronavirus covid-19 has killed more people than SARS and MERS combined, despite lower case fatality rate\nStrategies to control COVID-19 and future pandemics in Africa and around the globe\nClinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study\nRisk factors for severity and mortality in adult COVID-19 inpatients in Wuhan\nA European Renal Best Practice (ERBP) position statement on the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guidelines on acute kidney injury: part 1: definitions, conservative management and contrast-induced nephropathy\nDefinition and classification of kidney diseases\nCriteria of drug-induced liver disorders.

coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.\n\n Increasing quartile of NLR was statistically significantly associated with secondary outcome.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR is associated with outcomes in unselected critically

recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as

coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing Municipal Science and Technology

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

Full-length genome sequences were obtained from five patients at an early stage of the outbreak.\n The sequences are almost identical and share 79.6% sequence identity to SARS-CoV.\n Furthermore, we show that 2019-nCoV is 96% identical at the whole-genome level to a bat coronavirus.\n Pairwise protein sequence analysis of seven conserved non-structural proteins domains show that this virus belongs to the species of SARSr-CoV.\n In addition, 2019-nCoV virus isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of a critically ill patient could be neutralized by sera from several patients.\n

A first step in understanding SARS pathogenesis","abstract":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an acute infectious disease that spreads mainly via the respiratory route.\n A distinct coronavirus (SARS?CoV) has been identified as the aetiological agent of SARS.\n Recently, a metallopeptidase named angiotensin?converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as the functional receptor for SARS?CoV.\n Although ACE2 mRNA is known to be present in virtually all organs, its protein expression is largely unknown.\n Since identifying the possible route of infection has major implications for understanding the pathogenesis and future treatment strategies for SARS, the present study investigated the localization of ACE2 protein in various human organs (oral and nasal mucosa, nasopharynx, lung, stomach, small intestine, colon, skin, lymph nodes, thymus, bone marrow, spleen, liver, kidney, and brain).\n The most remarkable finding was the surface expression of ACE2 protein on lung alveolar epithelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine.\n Furthermore, ACE2 was present in arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells in all organs studied.\n In conclusion, ACE2 is abundantly present in humans in the epithelia of the lung and small intestine, which might provide possible routes of entry for the SARS?CoV.\n This epithelial expression, together with the presence of ACE2 in vascular endothelium, also provides a first step in understanding the pathogenesis of the main SARS disease manifestations.\n Copyright © 2004

to other areas worldwide.\n Although diffuse alveolar damage and acute respiratory failure were the main features, the involvement of other organs needs to be explored.\n Since information on kidney disease in patients with COVID-19 is limited, we determined the prevalence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with COVID-19. Further, we evaluated the association between markers of abnormal kidney function and death in patients with COVID-19. This was a prospective cohort study of 701 patients with COVID-19 admitted in a tertiary teaching hospital that also encompassed three affiliates following this major outbreak in Wuhan in 2020 of whom 113 (16.1%) died in hospital.\n Median age of the patients was 63 years (interquartile range, 50-71), including 367 men and 334 women.\n On admission, 43.9% of patients had proteinuria and 26.7% had hematuria.\n The prevalence of elevated serum creatinine, elevated blood urea nitrogen and estimated glomerular filtration under 60 ml/min/1.73m2 were 14.4, 13.1 and 13.1%, respectively.\n During the study period, AKI occurred in 5.1% patients.\n Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that patients with kidney disease had a significantly higher risk for in-hospital death.\n Cox proportional hazard regression confirmed that elevated baseline serum creatinine (hazard ratio: 2.10, 95% confidence interval: 1.36-3.26), elevated baseline blood urea nitrogen (3.97, 2.57-6.14), AKI stage 1 (1.90, 0.76-4.76), stage 2 (3.51, 1.49-8.26), stage 3 (4.38, 2.31-8.31), proteinuria 1+ (1.80, 0.81-4.00), 2+?3+ (4.84, 2.00-11.70), and hematuria 1+ (2.99, 1.39-6.42), 2+?3+ (5.56,2.58- 12.01) were independent risk factors for in-hospital death after adjusting for age, sex, disease severity, comorbidity and leukocyte count.\n Thus, our findings show the prevalence of kidney disease on admission and the development of AKI during hospitalization in patients with COVID-19 is high and is associated with in-hospital mortality.\n Hence, clinicians should increase their awareness of kidney disease in patients with severe COVID-19.","id":"PMC7110296","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"International Society of Nephrology.

tested negative for MERS-CoV on RT-PCR.\n\n\nResults\nNone of the reported MERS-CoV presenting symptoms was significantly associated with being infected with MERS-CoV.\n\n On the other hand, WBC count was significantly lower in patients with confirmed MERS-CoV infection (median 5.7 vs 9.3, P: 0.0004).\n\n Neutrophil count was as well significantly lower in MERS-CoV patients (median 3.7 vs 6.7, P: 0.0001).\n\n Both AST, and ALT values were significantly higher in MERS-CoV infected group (AST median 42 vs 36, P: 0.03, and ALT median 33 vs 28, P: 0.003).\n\n Overall our MERS-CoV mortality rate was (10%) below the national figure of (40%).\n\n\nConclusions\nNone of the presenting symptoms are specific for MERS-CoV infection.\n\n And out of all the investigations WBC, neutrophil counts, AST and ALT values have some predictive utility.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7110705","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Hamzah

outcome in patients with RT-PCR confirmed MERS and in those with acute respiratory disease who were MERS-CoV negative, presenting to the King Fahad Medical City (KFMC) in Riyadh between October 2012 and May 2014. The demographics, clinical and laboratory characteristics and clinical outcomes of patients with RT-PCR confirmed MERS-CoV infection was compared with those testing negative MERS-CoV PCR.\n Health care workers (HCW) with MERS were compared with MERS patients who were not health care workers.\n One hundred and fifty nine patients were eligible for inclusion.\n Forty eight tested positive for MERS CoV, 44 (92%) being hospital acquired infections and 23 were HCW.\n There were 111 MERS-CoV negative patients with acute respiratory illnesses included in this study as “negative controls”.\n Patient with confirmed MERS-CoV infection were not clinically distinguishable from those with negative MERS-CoV RT-PCR results although diarrhoea was commoner in MERS patients.\n A high level of suspicion in initiating laboratory tests for MERS-CoV is therefore indicated.\n Variables associated with adverse outcome were older age and diabetes as a co-morbid illness.\n Interestingly, co-morbid illnesses other than diabetes were not significantly associated with poor outcome.\n Health care workers with MERS had a markedly better clinical outcome compared to non HCW MERS

Here we report the identification and characterization of a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which caused an epidemic of acute respiratory syndrome in humans in Wuhan, China.\n The epidemic, which started on 12 December 2019, had caused 2,794 laboratory-confirmed infections including 80 deaths by 26 January 2020. Full-length genome sequences were obtained from five patients at an early stage of the outbreak.\n The sequences are almost identical and share 79.6% sequence identity to SARS-CoV.\n Furthermore, we show that 2019-nCoV is 96% identical at the whole-genome level to a bat coronavirus.\n Pairwise protein sequence analysis of seven conserved non-structural proteins domains show that this virus belongs to the species of SARSr-CoV.\n In addition, 2019-nCoV virus isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of a critically ill patient could be neutralized by sera from several patients.\n Notably, we confirmed that 2019-nCoV uses the same cell entry receptor—angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2)—as SARS-CoV.\n","id":"PMC7095418","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature

China","abstract":"Background\nSince December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without

novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension

pimodivir, and baloxavir are inhibitory in preclinical models for influenza A viruses, including pandemic threat viruses and those resistant to currently approved antivirals, and two (favipiravir and baloxavir) also inhibit influenza B viruses.\n\n All are orally administered, although the dosing regimens vary.\n\n The polymerase basic protein 1 transcriptase inhibitor favipiravir has shown inconsistent clinical effects in uncomplicated influenza, and is teratogenic effects in multiple species, contraindicating its use in pregnancy.\n\n The polymerase basic protein 2 cap-binding inhibitor pimodivir displays antiviral effects alone and in combination with oseltamivir in uncomplicated influenza, although variants with reduced susceptibility emerge frequently during monotherapy.\n\n Single doses of the polymerase acidic protein cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir are effective in alleviating symptoms and rapidly inhibiting viral replication in otherwise healthy and higher risk patients with acute influenza, although variants with reduced susceptibility emerge frequently during monotherapy.\n\n Combinations of newer polymerase inhibitors with neuraminidase inhibitors show synergy in preclinical models and are currently undergoing clinical testing in hospitalized patients.\n\n\nSummary\nThese new polymerase inhibitors promise to add to

A(H1N1pdm09)-related critical illness","abstract":"Background\nPatients with 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1pdm09)-related critical illness were frequently treated with systemic corticosteroids.\n\n While observational studies have reported significant corticosteroid-associated mortality after adjusting for baseline differences in patients treated with corticosteroids or not, corticosteroids have remained a common treatment in subsequent influenza outbreaks, including avian influenza A(H7N9).\n\n Our objective was to describe the use of corticosteroids in these patients and investigate predictors of steroid prescription and clinical outcomes, adjusting for both baseline and time-dependent factors.\n\n\nMethods\nIn an observational cohort study of adults with H1N1pdm09-related critical illness from 51 Canadian ICUs, we investigated predictors of steroid administration and outcomes of patients who received and those who did not receive corticosteroids.\n\n We adjusted for potential baseline confounding using multivariate logistic regression and propensity score analysis and adjusted for potential time-dependent confounding using marginal structural models.\n\n\nResults\nAmong 607 patients, corticosteroids were administered to 280 patients (46.1 %) at a median daily dose of 227 (interquartile range, 154–443) mg of hydrocortisone equivalents for a median of 7.0 (4.0–13.0) days.\n\n Compared with patients who did not receive corticosteroids, patients who received corticosteroids had higher hospital crude mortality (25.5 % vs 16.4 %, p?=?0.007) and fewer ventilator-free days at 28 days (12.5?±?10.7 vs 15.7?±?10.1, p?&lt;?0.001).\n\n The odds ratio association between corticosteroid use and hospital mortality decreased from 1.85 (95 % confidence interval 1.12–3.04, p?=?0.02) with multivariate logistic regression, to 1.71 (1.05–2.78, p?=?0.03) after adjustment for propensity score to receive corticosteroids, to 1.52 (0.90–2.58, p?=?0.12) after case-matching on propensity score, and to 0.96 (0.28–3.28, p?=?0.95) using marginal structural modeling to adjust for time-dependent between-group differences.\n\n\nConclusions\nCorticosteroids were commonly prescribed for H1N1pdm09-related critical illness.\n\n Adjusting for only baseline between-group differences suggested a significant increased risk of death associated with corticosteroids.\n\n However, after adjusting for time-dependent differences, we found no significant association between corticosteroids and mortality.\n\n These findings highlight the challenges and importance in adjusting for baseline and time-dependent confounders when estimating clinical effects of treatments using observational studies.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13054-016-1230-8) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized

It was noted that decreased NLRP3 inflammasome activation was associated with inhibited nuclear factor (NF)-?B activation, reduced reactive oxygen species production and increased autophagy.\n Additionally, the combined treatment reduced the expression of other proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and decreased inflammatory cell infiltration in lung tissue and bronchioalveolar lavage fluid.\n Consistently, it inhibited the mTOR-NF-?B-NLRP3 inflammasome-IL-1? axis in a lung epithelial cell line.\n These results demonstrated that combined treatment with sirolimus and oseltamivir attenuates pH1N1-induced severe lung injury, which is correlated with suppressed mTOR-NLRP3-IL-1? axis and reduced viral titer.\n Therefore, treatment with sirolimus as an adjuvant along with

with influenza A or B infection (FLU-IVIG): a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial","abstract":"Background\nSince the 1918 influenza pandemic, non-randomised studies and small clinical trials have suggested that convalescent plasma or anti-influenza hyperimmune intravenous immunoglobulin (hIVIG) might have clinical benefit for patients with influenza infection, but definitive data do not exist.\n\n We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of hIVIG in a randomised controlled trial.\n\n\nMethods\nThis randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was planned for 45 hospitals in Argentina, Australia, Denmark, Greece, Mexico, Spain, Thailand, UK, and the USA over five influenza seasons from 2013–14 to 2017–18. Adults (?18 years of age) were admitted for hospital treatment with laboratory-confirmed influenza A or B infection and were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive standard care plus either a single 500-mL infusion of high-titre hIVIG (0·25 g/kg bodyweight, 24·75 g maximum; hIVIG group) or saline placebo (placebo group).\n\n Eligible patients had a National Early Warning score of 2 points or greater at the time of screening and their symptoms began no more than 7 days before randomisation.\n\n Pregnant and breastfeeding women were excluded, as well as any patients for whom the treatment would present a health risk.\n\n Separate randomisation schedules were generated for each participating clinical site using permuted block randomisation.\n\n Treatment assignments were obtained using a web-based application by the site pharmacist who then masked the solution for infusion.\n\n Patients and investigators were masked to study treatment.\n\n The primary endpoint was a six-category ordinal outcome of clinical status at day 7, ranging in severity from death to resumption of normal activities after discharge.\n\n The choice of day 7 was based on haemagglutination inhibition titres from a pilot study.\n\n It was analysed with a proportional odds model, using all six categories to estimate a common odds ratio (OR).\n\n An OR greater than 1 indicated that, for a given category, patients in the hIVIG group were more likely to be in a better category than those in the placebo group.\n\n Prespecified primary analyses for safety and efficacy were based on patients who received an infusion and for whom eligibility could be confirmed.\n\n This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.\n\ngov, NCT02287467.\n\n\nFindings\n313 patients were enrolled in 34 sites between Dec 11, 2014, and May 28, 2018. We also used data from 16 patients enrolled at seven of the 34 sites during the pilot study between Jan 15, 2014, and April 10, 2014. 168 patients were randomly assigned to the hIVIG group and 161 to the placebo group.\n\n 21 patients were excluded (12 from the hIVIG group and 9 from the placebo group) because they did not receive an infusion or their eligibility could not be confirmed.\n\n Thus, 308 were included in the primary analysis.\n\n hIVIG treatment produced a robust rise in haemagglutination inhibition titres against influenza A and smaller rises in influenza B titres.\n\n Based on the proportional odds model, the OR on day 7 was 1·25 (95% CI 0·79–1·97; p=0·33).\n\n In subgroup analyses for the primary outcome, the OR in patients with influenza A was 0·94 (0·55–1·59) and was 3·19 (1·21–8·42) for those with influenza B (interaction p=0·023).\n\n Through 28 days of follow-up, 47 (30%) of 156 patients in the hIVIG group and in 45 (30%) of 152 patients in the placebo group had the composite safety outcome of death, a serious adverse event, or a grade 3 or 4 adverse event (hazard ratio [HR] 1·06, 95% CI 0·70–1·60; p=0·79).\n\n Six (4%) patients in the hIVIG group and five (3%) in the placebo group died, but these deaths were not necessarily related to treatment.\n\n\nInterpretation\nWhen administered alongside standard care (most commonly oseltamivir), hIVIG was not superior to placebo for adults hospitalised with influenza infection.\n\n By contrast with our prespecified subgroup hypothesis that hIVIG would result in more favourable responses in patients with influenza A than B, we found the opposite effect.\n\n The clinical benefit of hIVIG for patients with influenza B is supported by antibody affinity analyses, but confirmation is warranted.\n\n\nFunding\nNIAID and NIH.\n\n Partial support was provided by the Medical Research Council (MRC_UU_12023/23) and the Danish National Research Foundation.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6868512","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier","authors":[{"firstname":"Richard

masks in healthcare workers","abstract":"Objective\nThe aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of cloth masks to medical masks in hospital healthcare workers (HCWs).\n\n The null hypothesis is that there is no difference between medical masks and cloth masks.\n\n\nSetting\n14 secondary-level/tertiary-level hospitals in Hanoi, Vietnam.\n\n\nParticipants\n1607 hospital HCWs aged ?18?years working full-time in selected high-risk wards.\n\n\nIntervention\nHospital wards were randomised to: medical masks, cloth masks or a control group (usual practice, which included mask wearing).\n\n Participants used the mask on every shift for 4 consecutive weeks.\n\n\nMain outcome measure\nClinical respiratory illness (CRI), influenza-like illness (ILI) and laboratory-confirmed respiratory virus infection.\n\n\nResults\nThe rates of all infection outcomes were highest in the cloth mask arm, with the rate of ILI statistically significantly higher in the cloth mask arm (relative risk (RR)=13.00, 95% CI 1.69 to 100.07) compared with the medical mask arm.\n\n Cloth masks also had significantly higher rates of ILI compared with the control arm.\n\n An analysis by mask use showed ILI (RR=6.64, 95% CI 1.45 to 28.65) and laboratory-confirmed virus (RR=1.72, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.94) were significantly higher in the cloth masks group compared with the medical masks group.\n\n Penetration of cloth masks by particles was almost 97% and medical masks 44%.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis study is the first RCT of cloth masks, and the results caution against the use of cloth masks.\n\n This is an important finding to inform occupational health and safety.\n\n Moisture retention, reuse of cloth masks and poor filtration may result in increased risk of infection.\n\n Further research is needed to inform the widespread use of cloth masks globally.\n\n However, as a precautionary measure, cloth masks should not be recommended for HCWs, particularly in high-risk situations, and guidelines need to be updated.\n\n\nTrial registration number\nAustralian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry: ACTRN12610000887077.\n","id":"PMC4420971","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BMJ Publishing

(ESICM) H1N1 registry.\n\n\nResults\nTwo hundred twenty patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) with completed outcome data were analyzed.\n\n Invasive mechanical ventilation was used in 155 (70.5%).\n\n Sixty-seven (30.5%) of the patients died in ICU and 75 (34.1%) whilst in hospital.\n\n One hundred twenty-six (57.3%) patients received corticosteroid therapy on admission to ICU.\n\n Patients who received corticosteroids were significantly older and were more likely to have coexisting asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and chronic steroid use.\n\n These patients receiving corticosteroids had increased likelihood of developing hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) [26.2% versus 13.8%, p &lt; 0.05; odds ratio (OR) 2.2, confidence interval (CI) 1.1–4.5].\n\n Patients who received corticosteroids had significantly higher ICU mortality than patients who did not (46.0% versus 18.1%, p &lt; 0.01; OR 3.8, CI 2.1–7.2).\n\n Cox regression analysis adjusted for severity and potential confounding factors identified that early use of corticosteroids was not significantly associated with mortality [hazard ratio (HR) 1.3, 95% CI 0.7–2.4, p = 0.4] but was still
