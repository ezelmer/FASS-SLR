A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was suspected to be the etiology with Phinolophus bat as the alleged origin. In just two months, the virus has spread from Wuhan to the whole China, and another 33 countries. By 24:00 on February 24, accumulative 77,658 confirmed cases with 9,126 severe cases and 2,663 deaths were documented in China, and 2,309 confirmed cased with 33 death were reported in other countries (including Japan, Korea, Italy, Singapore, Iran as the top five countries). As of 24:00 on February 11, a total of 1,716 confirmed cases and 1,303 clinically diagnosed cases of medical personnel were reported from 422 medical institutions, of which 5 died, accounting for 0.4% of the nationwide deaths during the same time period.\nIn absence of specific therapeutic drugs or vaccines for 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), it is essential to detect the diseases at an early stage, and immediately isolate the infected person from the healthy population. According to the latest guideline of Diagnosis and Treatment of Pneumonitis Caused by 2019-nCoV (trial sixth version) published by the China government, the diagnosis of COVID-19 must be confirmed by the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or gene sequencing for respiratory or blood specimens, as the key indicator for hospitalization. However, with limitations of sample collection and transportation, and kit performance, the total positive rate of RT-PCR for throat swab samples was reported to be about 30% to 60% at initial presentation. In the current emergency, the low sensitivity of RT-PCR implies that many COVID-19 patients may not be identified and may not receive appropriate treatment in time; such patients constitute a risk for infecting a larger population given the highly contagious nature of the virus. Chest CT, as a routine imaging tool for pneumonia diagnosis, is relatively easy to perform and can produce fast diagnosis. In this context, chest CT may provide benefit for diagnosis of COVID-19. As recently reported, chest CT demonstrates typical radiographic features in almost all COVID-19 patients, including ground-glass 4 opacities, multifocal patchy consolidation, and/or interstitial changes with a peripheral distribution. Those typical features were also observed in patients with negative RT-PCR results but clinical symptoms. It has been noted in small-scale studies that the current RT-PCR testing has limited sensitivity, while chest CT may reveal pulmonary abnormalities consistent with COVID-19 in patients with initial negative RT-PCR results.\nTo better understand the diagnostic value of chest CT compared with RT-PCR testing, we report the results of chest CT in comparison to the initial and serial RT-PCR results in 1014 patients with suspected COVID-19.\nMaterials and Methods\nPatients and data sources of RT-PCR results\nThe institutional review board of our hospital (Tongji Hospital of Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China) approved this retrospective study and written informed consent was waived. From January 6 to February 6, 2020, a total of 1049 patients (mean age, 51 +- 15 years; 46% male) who were suspected of novel coronavirus infection and underwent both chest CT imaging and laboratory virus nucleic acid test (RT-PCR assay with throat swab samples) were retrospectively enrolled in our hospital (Figure 1). The RT-PCR results were extracted from the patients' electronic medical records in our hospital information system (HIS). The RT-PCR assays were performed by using TaqMan One-Step RT-PCR Kits from Shanghai Huirui Biotechnology Co., Ltd or Shanghai BioGerm Medical Biotechnology Co., Ltd, both of which have approved use by the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA). For patients with multiple RT-PCR assays, the repeated testing conducted up to and including 3 days after the initial test was adopted as confirmation of diagnosis. Repeated testing more than 3 days after the initial RT PCR Test was used to analyze conversion of RT-PCR results, in correlation with the chest CT scan(s).\nFlowchart of this study.\nRT-PCR= reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.\nFor patients with multiple RT-PCR assays, the diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed when any one of the nucleic acid test results was positive. If a patient had multiple 5 chest CT scans, we included the scan with shortest interval (less than or equal to 7 days) to compare with the RT-PCR assay for the analysis of diagnostic performance; any other chest CT scans in the same patient were used to assess the temporal change of the disease. Patients were excluded when the time-interval between chest CT and the RT-PCR assay was longer than 7 days.\nChest CT protocols\nAll images were obtained on one of the three CT systems (uCT 780, United Imaging, China; Optima 660, GE, America; Somatom Definition AS+, Siemens Healthineers, Germany) with patients in supine position. The main scanning parameters were as follow: tube voltage = 120 kVp, automatic tube current modulation (30 - 70 mAs), pitch = 0.99 - 1.22 mm, matrix = 512 x 512, slice thickness = 10 mm, field of view = 350 mm x 350 mm. All images were then reconstructed with a slice thickness of 0.625 - 1.250 mm with the same increment.\nImage analysis\nTwo radiologists (T.A. and Z.L.Y. with 12 and 3 years of experience in interpreting chest CT imaging, respectively), who were blinded to RT-PCR results, reviewed all chest CT images and decided on positive or negative CT findings by consensus. The epidemiological history and clinical symptoms (fever and/ dry cough) were available for both readers. The radiologists classified the chest CT as positive or negative for COVID-19. The radiologists also described main CT features (ground-glass opacity, consolidation, reticulation/thickened interlobular septa, nodules), and lesion distribution (left, right or bilateral lungs).\nStatistical analysis\nThe statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 21.0 (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL). Continuous variables were displayed as mean +- standard deviation and categorical variables were reported as counts and percentages.\nUsing RT-PCR results as reference, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy of chest CT imaging were calculated. A 95% confidence interval was provided by the Wilson score method. The performance of chest CT for identifying COVID-19 in different age groups (&lt;60 years and &gt;= 60 years) and by gender was compared by the Chi-square test.\nFor patients with negative RT-PCR tests but positive CT results, follow-up chest CT images were re-reviewed to further confirm the imaging diagnosis if available. Clinical symptoms, typical imaging features on the initial chest CT scan, and dynamic changes on the serial follow-up chest CT scans were combined to classify the patients into highly likely cases, probable cases and uncertain cases for those without serial CT scans: highly likely cases, defined as patients with clinical symptoms (fever, cough, fatigue and/or shortness of breath), and typical CT features with dynamic changes (obvious progression or improvement in a short time) on serial CT scans; probable cases, defined as patients with clinical symptoms aforementioned and typical CT features, but stable on the follow-up CT scans, or without follow-up CT scans; uncertain cases defined as patients with only one positive chest CT scan, indicating viral pneumonia.\nAs to patients with multiple RT-PCR assays (with time-interval of 4 days or more), the conversion of RT-PCR test results (negative to positive, and positive to negative, respectively) was analyzed in correlation with the corresponding serial chest CT scans if available. Change in RT PCR and CT may reflect viral proliferation or clearance in infected patients.\nResults\nGeneral description\nThirty-five patients were excluded when the time-interval between chest CT and the RT-PCR assay was longer than 7 days. After exclusion of these patients, 1,014 patients (mean age, 51 +- 15 years; 46% [467/1014] men) were available for analysis. Figure 1 shows the flowchart of our study. Of 1014 patients, 601 had positive and 413 had negative RT-PCR results with a positive rate of 59% (601/1014) (95% confidence interval [CI], 56% - 62%) (Figure 1). Of 601 patients with positive RT-PCR results, 97% (580/601) had positive chest CT scans. Of 413 patients with negative RT-PCR result, 75% (308/413) had positive chest CT scans.\nThe median time interval between the paired chest CT exams and RT-PCR assays was 1 day (range of 0-7 days). 88% (888/1014) (95% CI, 86% - 90%) of patients had positive chest CT findings. The main chest CT findings were ground-glass opacity (46% [409/888]) and consolidations (50% [447/888]) (Table 1) (Figure 2-4). Most patients (90% [801/888]) had bilateral chest CT findings.\nCharacteristics of the included 1014 patients.\nChest CT images of a 29-year-old man with fever for 6 days.

With RT-PCR results as reference, the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy of chest CT in indicating COVID-19 infection were 97% (95% CI 95-98%, 580/601 patients), 25% (95% CI 22-30%, 105/413 patients) and 68% (95%CI 65-70%, 685/1014 patients), respectively.\nThe performance of chest CT in diagnosing COVID-19 in different age and sex groups is reported in Table 2. The positive predictive values (PPV) and accuracy of chest CT in diagnosing COVID-19 were higher in patients &gt;= 60 years than that in patients &lt; 60 years (p = 0.001 and 0.009, respectively); and no difference existed for sensitivity, specificity and negative predictive value (NPV) (p = 0.40, 0.41 and 0.58, respectively). The specificity and NPV of chest CT in diagnosing COVID-19 were greater for women than that for men (p = 0.009 and 0.04, respectively); and no difference existed for sensitivity, PPV and accuracy (p = 0.36, 0.74 and 0.25, respectively).\nThe performance of chest CT for COVID-19 infection with RT-PCR result as reference.\nDiscrepant findings between chest CT and RT-PCR\n21 patients (mean age, 46 +- 24 years, 57% male) had positive RT-PCR results but without lesions on initial chest CT. The chest CT images of 308 patients (mean age, 47 +- 14 years, 48% man) suggested COVID-19, while their RT-PCR assays from throat swab samples were negative (Figure 5 and 6). Of 308 patients, most (83% [256/308]) had bilateral lung lesions consisting of ground-glass opacities (41% [126/308])) and 8 consolidations (56% [172/308]) on chest CT.\nChest CT images of a 62-year-old man with fever for 2 weeks, and dyspnea for 1 day.

(column A) Chest CT with multiple axial images shows multiple ground-glass opacities in the bilateral lungs. (column B) Chest CT with multiple axial images shows enlarged multiple ground-glass opacities.

(A-C) Chest CT scans show typical mixed ground-glass opacities and multifocal consolidation shadows in bilateral lungs without evidence of resolution without resolution over 16 days.\nBased on the analysis of clinical symptoms, CT features and serial CT scans if available, 48% (147/308) of patients were considered as highly likely cases, 33 % (103/308) as probable cases and 19 % (58/308) as uncertain cases.\nAnalysis of multiple RT-PCR assays and serial chest CT scans\nA total of 258 patients underwent multiple RT-PCR assays (Table 3). For patients with follow-up RT-PCR testing (with time-interval of more than 3 days), the mean interval time between initial negative to positive RT-PCR results was 5.1 +- 1.5 days with a range of 4-8 days and a median of 4 days (n = 15). The mean interval time between initial positive RT-PCR testing and subsequent negative change was 6.9 +- 2.3 days with a range of 4-15 days and the median was 7 days (n = 57). In the subgroup of negative to positive RT-PCR results, 67% (10/15) cases showed initial positive chest CT imaging before the initial negative RT-PCR results; and 93% (14/15) cases showed that the initial chest CT had typical imaging features consistent with COVID-19 prior (or parallel) to the initial positive RT-PCR results, with a median time-interval of 8 days (range, 0 - 21 days). In the subgroup of positive to negative RT-PCR results, 60% (34/57) cases showed the initial chest CT had typical imaging features consistent with COVID-19 prior (or parallel) to the initial positive RT-PCR results, with a median time-interval of 6 days (range, 0 - 27 days); and almost all patients (56/57) had initial positive chest CT scans before or within 6 days of the initial positive RT-PCR results. In addition, 42% (24/57) cases showed improvement of follow-up chest CT scans before the RT-PCR results turning negative; and only 3.5% (2/57) cases showed disease progression on the follow-up CT scans after the RT-PCR results turning negative (Figure 7).\nDetails of multiple RT-PCR assays in 258 patients.\nAnalysis of serial RT-PCR assays in correlation with serial chest CT scans.

The horizontal axis is the time point of initial chest CT and follow-up chest CT scans relative to the time point of the consecutive two RT-PCR tests (before positive RT-PCR, negative numbers; after RT-PCR, positive numbers).\nDiscussion\nEarly diagnosis of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is crucial for disease treatment and control. Compared to RT-PCR, chest CT imaging may be a more reliable, practical, and rapid method to diagnose and assess COVID-19, especially in the epidemic area. With RT-PCR results as reference in 1014 patients, the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy of chest CT in indicating COVID-19 infection were 97% (580/601), 25% (105/413) and 68% (685/1014), respectively. The positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 65% (580/888) and 83% (105/126), respectively.\nAccording to current diagnostic criterion, viral nucleic acid test by RT-PCR assay plays a vital role in determining hospitalization and isolation for individual patients. However, its lack of sensitivity, insufficient stability, and relatively long processing time were detrimental to the control of the disease epidemic. In our study, the positive rate of RT-PCR assay for throat swab samples was 59% (95%CI, 56%-62%) which was consistent with previous report (30 - 60%). In addition, a number of any external factors may affect RT-PCR testing results including sampling operations, specimens source (upper or lower respiratory tract), sampling timing (different period of the disease development), and performance of detection kits. As such, the results of RT-PCR tests must be cautiously interpreted.\nChest CT is a conventional, non-invasive imaging modality with high accuracy and speed. Based on available data published in recent literature, almost all patients with COVID-19 had characteristic CT features in the disease process, such as different degrees of ground-glass opacities with/without crazy-paving sign, multifocal organizing pneumonia, and architectural distortion in a peripheral distribution. From our study, in addition, about 60% (34/57) cases had typical CT features consistent with COVID-19 prior (or parallel) to the initial positive RT-PCR results, and almost all patients (56/57) had initial positive chest CT scans before or within 6 days of the initial positive RT-PCR results. This indicates that CT imaging can be very useful in early detection of suspected cases.\nIn this study, 97% of patients confirmed by RT-PCR assays showed positive findings on chest CT, which was higher than that reported by Zhong et al.(76.4%). A likely explanation is that patients in this study were all from the largest hospital in Wuhan, China, the central area of the outbreak of COVID-19. In this context, radiologists were more likely to make a diagnosis of COVID-19 when typical CT features were found. Given the sensitivity of chest CT (hence its value to prevent further spread of disease), a clinical diagnosis criteria based on typical CT imaging features was temporarily adopted in the revised 5th edition of the Guideline of Diagnosis and Treatment, which was only applicable in Hubei Province, China. Besides, Pan et al. demonstrated that multiple re-examinations of chest CT can accurately reflect the disease evolution and monitor the treatment effect. We also observed 42% (24/57) of patients showed improvement in follow-up chest CT scans, which was earlier than the RT-PCT results turning negative. Only two of 57 (3.5%) patients showed progression on follow-up chest CT scans after RT-PCR test results turned negative.\nFor patients with negative RT-PCR tests, more than 70% had typical CT manifestations. On the one hand, due to the overlap of CT imaging features between COVID-19 and other viral pneumonia, false-positive cases of COVID-19 can be identified on chest CT. Nevertheless, considering the rapidly spreading epidemic of COVID-19, the priority was to identify any suspicious CT case in order to isolate the patients and administer appropriate treatment. In the context of emergency disease control, some false-positive cases may be acceptable. On the other hand, given the relatively low positive rate of RT-PCR assay, some &quot;false-positive&quot; cases on CT may indeed be &quot;true-positive&quot; if RT-PCR assay is an imperfect standard of reference. In fact, from the results of this study, about 81% of the patients with negative RT-PCR results but positive chest CT scans were re-classified as highly likely or probable cases with COVID-19, by the comprehensive analysis of clinical symptoms, typical CT manifestations, and dynamic CT follow-ups. Based on serial RT-PCR test and CT scans, 90% (14/15) of patients had initial positive chest CT consistent with COVID-19 prior (or parallel) to the initial positive RT-PCR results. As such, it can be speculated that those negative RT-PCR results could be problematic. In patients with negative RT-PCR tests, a combination of exposure history, clinical symptoms, typical CT imaging features, and dynamic changes should be used to identify COVID-19 with higher sensitivity.\nThere are several limitations in the present study. First, by using RT-PCR assays with relatively low positive rate as reference, the sensitivity of chest CT for COVID-19 may be overestimated while the specificity underestimated. In epidemic area, negative RT-PCR but positive CT features can still be highly suggestive of COVID-19. This has important clinical and societal implications; rapid detection with high sensitivity of viral infection may allow better control of viral spread. A second limitation is that clinical and laboratory data were limited during this urgent period when regional hospitals were overloaded. Nevertheless, the results reported in this work from the center of the epidemic area should supply important information regarding the value of CT and RT-PCR in combating the prevalent disease.\nIn conclusion, chest CT imaging has high sensitivity for diagnosis of COVID-19. Our data and analysis suggest that chest CT should be considered for the COVID-19 screening, comprehensive evaluation, and following-up, especially in epidemic areas with high pre-test probability for disease.\nAPPENDIX\nDisclosure of Conflicts of Interest: W.Z.L. is employee of Julei Technology Company.

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.\n\n Increasing quartile of NLR was statistically significantly associated with secondary outcome.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR is associated with outcomes in unselected critically ill patients.\n\n In patients with sepsis, there was no statistically significant relationship between NLR and mortality.\n\n Further investigation is required to increase understanding of the pathophysiology of this relationship and to validate these findings with data collected prospectively.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article

recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as

pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese

Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7121484","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical Society","authors":[{"firstname":"Qun","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuhua","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoye","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yeqing","surname":"Tong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ruiqi","surname":"Ren","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kathy S.M.","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Eric H.Y.","surname":"Lau","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jessica Y.","surname":"Wong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuesen","surname":"Xing","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nijuan","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chao","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tian","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Man","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wenxiao","surname":"Tu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chuding","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lianmei","surname":"Jin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rui","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Suhua","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rui","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yinbo","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ge","surname":"Shao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhongfa","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhiqiang","surname":"Deng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Boxi","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhitao","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yanping","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guoqing","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tommy T.Y.","surname":"Lam","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Joseph T.","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"George F.","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Benjamin J.","surname":"Cowling","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gabriel M.","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zijian","surname":"Feng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"30 January 2020 pneumonia epidemic situation of C SARS-CoV-2 infection in Hubei province, China-Hubei Provincial Health Committee","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"4 February 2020 pneumonia epidemic situation of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Hubei province, China-Hubei Provincial Health Committee","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30211-7","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study","abstract":"Background\nIn December, 2019, a pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China.\n\n We aimed to further clarify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020.

China has had the majority of COVID 19 cases (92%). Patients infected with COVID-19 typically present with fever, cough, dyspnea, and muscle aches while imaging frequently reveals bilateral pneumonia.\nThe standard diagnostic method being used is real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect viral nucleotides from specimens obtained by oropharyngeal swab, nasopharyngeal swab, bronchoalveolar lavage, or tracheal aspirate. However, recent reports have revealed that RT-PCR has a sensitivity as low as 60-71% for detecting COVID-19, which can possibly be attributed to low viral load present in test specimens or laboratory error. These false negatives hinder quarantine efforts, necessitate repeat testing and has the potential to overload the current supply of testing kits and related infrastructure. By contrast, chest CT has demonstrated about 56-98% sensitivity in detecting COVID-19 at initial presentation and can be helpful in rectifying false negatives obtained from RT-PCR during early stages of disease development. Chest CT of COVID-19 patients reveals areas of consolidation and ground-glass opacity (GGO) with bilateral peripheral involvement in multiple lobes progressing to &quot;crazy-paving&quot; patterns and consolidation. CT signs gradually improve beginning approximately 14 days post-symptom onset.\nDespite its high sensitivity in diagnosing COVID-19 in a screening population, chest CT had low specificity (25%) in a recent report of 1014 patients with COVID-19. Prior studies have not directly compared chest CT patterns of COVID-19 from viral pneumonia on chest CT. The purpose of this study was to assess the performance of United States (U.S.) and Chinese radiologists in differentiating COVID-19 from viral pneumonia on chest CT.\nMaterials and Methods\nPatient cohort\nThe institutional review board of all seven hospitals in Hunan Providence, China and Rhode Island Hospital from the U.S. approved this retrospective study and written informed consent was waived. A total of 256 patients with both positive COVID-19 by RT-PCR and chest CT imaging within two weeks were retrospectively identified from 7 Chinese hospitals in Hunan Providence, China from January 6 to February 20, 2020. The RT-PCR results were extracted from the patients' electronic medical records in the hospital information system (HIS). The RT-PCR assays were performed by using TaqMan One-Step RT-PCR Kits from Shanghai Huirui Biotechnology Co., Ltd or Shanghai BioGerm Medical Biotechnology Co., Ltd, both of which have approved use by the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA). For patients with multiple RT-PCR assays, positive result on the last performed test was adopted as confirmation of diagnosis. The number of cases included from each hospital is shown in Supplementary Table 1. Among these patients, 37 with negative chest CT were excluded, resulting in a final cohort of 219 patients. The chest CT protocols from the 7 hospitals are shown in Supplementary Table 2.\nThe radiology search engine MONTAGE (Nuance Communications, Burlington, MA) at Rhode Island Hospital in Providence, RI was used to identify cases that contain the word &quot;pneumonia&quot; in the impression section of the radiology CT reports from 2017 to 2019. The identified CT scans were directly downloaded from the hospital Picture Archiving and Communications Systems (PACS) and non-chest CTs were excluded. Positive results from Respiratory Pathogen Panel (RPP) were used to locate patients of possible viral pneumonia from 2017 to 2019. The tests of ePlex Respiratory Pathogen panel (GenMark Diagnostics, Carlsbad, CA) were performed in the Microbiology Lab of Rhode Island Hospital Pathology Department according to it manufacture protocol. A diagram illustrating the initial breakdown of RPP search results is shown in Supplementary Figure 1. The two lists were cross-matched to generate a final list that contained CT chest scans with the word &quot;pneumonia&quot; in the final impression and positive RPP test within 7 days of each other. Then, the impression sections of these CT reports were reviewed by a research assistant (BH) and a radiologist (HXB) board-certified in general diagnostic radiology and interventional radiology with one year of practice experience to identify 205 cases with final CT impression being &quot;consistent with&quot; or &quot;highly suspicious for&quot; pneumonia. Our final cohort consisted of 424 patients. A diagram illustrating patient inclusion and exclusion is shown in Figure 1. A diagram illustrating the final breakdown of RPP results is shown in Figure 2.\nIllustration of study flow RIH: Rhode Island Hospital\nDistribution of viral pathogens based on RPP test in the final cohort. It is an FDA approved assay that simultaneous detects 19 viruses (influenza A virus; influenza A H1 virus; influenza A 2009 H1 virus; influenza A H3 virus; influenza B virus; adenovirus; coronaviruses [HKU1, OC43, NL63, and 229E]; human rhinovirus/enterovirus; human metapneumovirus; parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, 3, and 4; and respiratory syncytial virus [RSV] [RSV subtype A and RSV subtype B]) and 2 bacteria (Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae). The ePlex panel has been proven to be a highly sensitive and specific multiplex assay for respiratory pathogen detection. In a multicentric study, the positive percent agreement values (equivalent to sensitivity when a perfect reference method is unavailable) ranged from 85.1% to 95.1% and the negative percent agreement values (equivalent to specificity) ranged from 99.5% to 99.8% when compared to another well-established RP panel from BioFire (Salt Lack City, UT) (17).\nRadiologist interpretation\nThree Chinese radiologists, who were blinded to RT-PCR results, reviewed all chest CT images and scored each case as COVID-19, pneumonia of other etiology or neither. Fifty-eight cases age-matched between the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 pneumonia groups were randomly selected from the entire cohort and evaluated in the same way by four U.S. radiologists. All identifying information was removed from the CT studies, which were shuffled and uploaded to 3D slicer for interpretation. Information on the radiologists regarding location of practice, years in practice, cardiothoracic imaging fellowship and COVID-10 specific training experience is shown in Table 1.\nBackgrounds of radiologists who reviewed the cases\nCT features\nDifferent CT features on the entire cohort were recorded by two Chinese radiologists in consensus. If consensus could not be reached, it was resolved by a senior radiologist (X.Z.) with more than 10 years of chest CT experience.\nStatistical analysis\nContinuous variables were expressed as medians and ranges, while categorical variables as counts and percentages. Metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy were calculated to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the radiologists. For the calculations, COVID-19 was considered positive result, while pneumonia of other etiology and neither were considered negative result. Exact binomial 95% confidence intervals were calculated for sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy using the epiR package in the R statistical computing language (R version 3.4.2, The R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria; https://www.r-project.org). P values of &lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant.\nResults\nOur final cohort consisted of 424 patients, including 205 patients with non-COVID-19 pneumonia from the U.S. and 219 patients with COVID-19 from China. The average number of days between CT and positive RT-PCR test result was 4.1+-4.4 days for the COVID-19 group; the average number of days between CT and positive RPP test result was 1.0+-1.7 days. Patients with COVID-19 were younger (mean age of 45 vs. 65 years, p&lt;0.001) and less likely to have elevated white blood cell count (29% vs. 55%, p&lt;0.001), but more likely to have reduced lymphocyte count (16% vs. 44%, p&lt;0.001). Clinical characteristics including comorbidities comparing the two groups are shown in Table 2.\nClinical characteristics of the US non-COVID-19 and Chinese COVID-19 patient cohorts\nFor the entire cohort, the accuracy of the three Chinese radiologists to identify COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 pneumonia was 83% (95 CI: 79-86%), 80% (95% CI: 76-83%), and 60% (95% CI: 55-65%), respectively (Table 3). Sensitivity ranged from 72 to 94%, and specificity showed great variation (24 to 94%) (Table 3).\nPerformance results of the three Chinese radiologists who reviewed all 424 cases\nIn a randomly selected, age-matched cohort of 58 patients, the accuracy of four U.S. radiologists to differentiate COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 pneumonia was 97% (95% CI: 88-100%), 88% (95 CI: 77-95%), 83% (95% CI: 71-91%), and 84% (95% CI: 73-93%), respectively (Table 4). Sensitivity ranged from 70 to 93%, and specificity ranged from 93 to 100% (Table 4).\nThe results of 3 Chinese radiologists and 4 U.S. radiologists who reviewed 58 age-matched cases.\nCompared to non-COVID-19 pneumonia, COVID-19 pneumonia was more likely to have a peripheral distribution (80% vs. 57%, p&lt;0.001), ground-glass opacity (91% vs. 68%, p&lt;0.001), fine reticular opacity (56% vs. 22%, p&lt;0.001), vascular thickening (59% vs. 22%, p&lt;0.001) and reverse halo sign (11% vs. 1%, p=0.005), but less likely to have a central+peripheral distribution (14% vs. 35%, p&lt;0.001), air bronchogram (14% vs. 23%, p=0.014), pleural thickening (15 vs. 33%, p&lt;0.001), pleural effusion (4 vs. 39%, p&lt;0.001) and lymphadenopathy (2.7% vs. 10.2%, p&lt;0.001) (Table 5).\nCT features comparing COVID-19 and viral pneumonia\nFigure 3 demonstrates example cases in which the majority of the radiologists mistook non-COVID-19 pneumonia for COVID-19 infection (A-B) or vice versa (C-H).\nA.

RT-PCR testing has low sensitivity early on in the disease course. Although chest CT has high sensitivity, it has low specificity. This low specificity may stem from the fact that it is difficult to distinguish COVID-19 findings from findings of other disease on chest CT. To optimize patient management, medical care, and disease control it is important to determine the efficacy of chest CT in distinguishing COVID-19 from pneumonia of other etiologies by radiologists. The study conducted herein revealed that radiologists are capable of distinguishing COVID-19 from viral pneumonia on chest CT with high specificity but moderate sensitivity.\nHealthcare providers being able to reliably differentiate COVID-19 from other causes of pneumonia on chest CT would benefit diagnostic workup of the disease by compensating for the poor sensitivity of RT-PCR, particularly during early disease stages. Although chest CT has demonstrated high sensitivity relative to RT-PCR testing for COVID-19 diagnosis, it may not reveal distinct patterns for COVID-19 in all cases. This can make it hard to distinguish COVID-19 from other causes of viral pneumonia. For example, influenza and COVID-19 both demonstrate GGO and consolidation on chest CT. Introducing the possibility of pathologies with similar chest CT findings to those of COVID-19 ultimately complicates the differential diagnosis. Our study is significant because it demonstrates that radiologists are capable of distinguishing COVID-19 from other etiology of pneumonia on chest CT with high specificity. This suggests that there is potential that if the differential diagnosis is between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 pneumonia, a negative diagnosis of COVID-19 by radiologists on chest CT may be good enough to exclude patients from having the disease with fairly good certainty. Our analysis of specific cases where radiologists were wrong reveals that the mistakes were made when the COVID-19 chest CT findings are either subtle (likely reflecting early time in the disease process) (Figures 3C and 3D) or when COVID-19 has atypical chest CT findings (Figures 3E, 3F, 3G, and 3H). It is worth noting that non-COVID-19 pneumonia can also have typical appearance of COVID-19 (Figures 3A and 3B). This poses a dilemma because mandated quarantine for all suspected cases can put significant strain on medical infrastructure, healthcare providers, and the lives of patients, but may need to be followed as a necessary precaution due to variation in presentation with timing of disease and atypical findings on chest CT. Future direction includes development of an artificial intelligence classifier that can further augment radiologist performance in combination with clinical information.\nOur study has several limitations. First, the cohort size was small, especially when it comes to cases reviewed by U.S. radiologists. There is selection bias associated with our screening strategy as well. It remains unclear if diagnostic outcomes would improve in a more well-balanced and larger-scale prospective study of similar design. It is also noteworthy that the U.S. radiologists in this study had minimal training specific to diagnosing COVID-19 and that Chinese radiologists practiced in an area with relatively low prevalence of the disease. It is possible that Chinese radiologists working near the epicenter of the disease with a higher degree of experience specific to COVID-19 would have performed significantly better than either group in the present study. In addition, although RPP test and chest CT findings within 7 days of symptom presentation were used to enrich our &quot;pneumonia of other etiology&quot; cohort with viral pneumonia cases, the cause and effect relationship is not 100%. Thus, it is possible that some of the selected patients had mixed viral and bacterial pneumonia or other diseases entirely. Finally, the radiologists were not given clinical information during the evaluation, which could have further improved their performance.\nAs more research is done, information may be gathered by providers to make this differential more facile to navigate. Until that point, it is recommended that individuals with signs of pneumonia on chest CT be quarantined while RT-PCR testing is performed in conjunction with a thorough medical evaluation including travel history and disease contacts in order to make an accurate COVID-19 diagnosis and prevent disease spread. In conclusion, radiologists had high specificity but moderate sensitivity in distinguishing COVID-19 from viral pneumonia on chest CT.\nAPPENDIX\nH.X.B and B.H. contributed equally to this work. \nAbbreviations:\nCOVID-19\nCoronavirus Disease 2019\nRT-PCR\nReverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction\nFDA\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration\nRPP\nrespiratory pathogen panel\nReferences\nA novel coronavirus from patients with pneumonia in China, 2019\nCoronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Locations with Confirmed COVID-19 Cases\nCoronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Situation Reports - 41\nStatement on the Second Meeting of the International Health Regulations (2005) Emergency Committee Regarding the Outbreak of Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)\nCorrelation of Chest CT and RT-PCR Testing in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China: A Report of 1014 Cases\nSensitivity of Chest CT for COVID-19: Comparison to RT-PCR\nEssentials for Radiologists on COVID-19: An Update:Radiology Scientific Expert Panel\nChest CT for Typical 2019-nCoV Pneumonia: Relationship to Negative RT-PCR Testing\nChest CT Findings in Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-10): Relationship to Duration of Infection\nTime Course of Lung Changes of Chest CT During Recovery From 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pneumonia\nCT Imaging Features of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)\nGenMark Diagnostics, Inc. ePlex Pipeline.

findings associated with COVID-19 pneumonia from initial diagnosis until patient recovery.\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\nThis retrospective review included patients with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 infection presenting between 12 January 2020 to 6 February 2020. Patients with severe respiratory distress and/ or oxygen requirement at any time during the disease course were excluded.\n\n Repeat Chest CT was obtained at approximately 4 day intervals.\n\n The total CT score was the sum of lung involvement (5 lobes, score 1-5 for each lobe, range, 0 none, 25 maximum) was determined.\n\n\nResults\nTwenty one patients (6 males and 15 females, age 25-63 years) with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated.\n\n These patients under went a total of 82 pulmonary CT scans with a mean interval of 4±1 days (range: 1-8 days).\n\n All patients were discharged after a mean hospitalized period of 17±4 days (range: 11-26 days).\n\n Maximum lung involved peaked at approximately 10 days (with the calculated total CT score of 6) from the onset of initial symptoms (R2=0.25), p&lt;0.001).\n\n Based on quartiles of patients from day 0 to day 26 involvement, 4 stages of lung CT were defined: Stage 1 (0-4 days): ground glass opacities (GGO) in 18/24 (75%) patients with the total CT score of 2±2; (2)Stage-2 (5-8d days): increased crazy-paving pattern 9/17 patients (53%) with a increase in total CT score (6±4, p=0.002); (3) Stage-3 (9-13days): consolidation 19/21 (91%) patients with the peak of total CT score (7±4); (4) Stage-4 (?14 days): gradual resolution of consolidation 15/20 (75%) patients with a decreased total CT score (6±4) without crazy-paving pattern.\n\n\nConclusion\nIn patients recovering from COVID-19 pneumonia (without severe respiratory distress during the disease course), lung abnormalities on chest CT showed greatest severity approximately 10 days after initial onset of symptoms.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7233367","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Radiological Society of North

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was identified as the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which became a pandemic infection. As of mid-March, more than 150 000 cases have been confirmed globally and the total number of cases and deaths outside China has overtaken the total number of cases and deaths in China. Most of the infected patients presented with fever, respiratory symptoms, and pulmonary opacities at CT; 20%-30% of the patients required mechanical ventilation, with death subsequently occurring in up to 10% of patients in some reports. A minor proportion of the patients who did not have clinical or radiologic abnormalities still served as a source of transmission.\nThe radiologic manifestations of COVID-19 have been mainly investigated with chest CT, and the typical findings were bilateral predominant ground-glass opacities (GGOs) with or without consolidation in the peripheral lungs. The recognition of the typical CT findings of COVID-19 is particularly important for diagnosing the disease in patients under investigation with a negative result on real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Nevertheless, a minority of patients with COVID-19 have negative CT findings or unilobar abnormalities with a minimal extent, indicating a heterogeneous distribution of the disease.\nChest radiography is the primary imaging modality for evaluating acute respiratory illness in immunocompetent patients. Although COVID-19 can present with evident abnormalities on chest radiographs, in approximately two-thirds of the patients, radiographs were normal. The primary utilization of CT scans instead of chest radiographs might be suggested for evaluating suspected cases of COVID-19 based on the presumed higher sensitivity of the former. Nevertheless, it is operationally more complex to perform CT scans of suspected cases than chest radiographs, considering the preventive measures necessary to prevent the spread of the infectious agent (eg, disinfection of imaging resources). Therefore, it is necessary to understand the diagnostic performance of chest radiographs in comparison with CT images in COVID-19. This study aimed compared the detectability of pulmonary opacities on chest radiographs of patients with COVID-19, correlating these findings with quantitative measurements obtained with CT.\nMaterials and Methods\nA part of the study population was included in another study that qualitatively analyzed the chest radiologic and CT findings of COVID-19 in Korea (nine of 14 patients). The institutional review board of all participating institutions (Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Incheon Medical Center, Seoul Medical Center, and The First Hospital of Lanzhou University) approved this retrospective study, and the requirement for informed consent was waived.\nStudy Population\nThere were 17 patients (mean age, 45.0 years +- 16.5 [standard deviation]; male-to-female ratio, 10:7) from five hospitals in Korea and China (14 patients from Korea and three patients from China) with PCR-proven COVID-19, who underwent a diagnostic chest CT scan and had an available same-day chest radiograph. One patient eventually required mechanical ventilation support during hospitalization; otherwise, patients recovered uneventfully. Thirteen of the patients underwent CT once at baseline, and the other four patients underwent CT twice (at baseline and follow-up). After excluding one normal baseline CT scan, we analyzed 20 CT scans and the corresponding chest radiographs of the patients. To analyze the diagnostic accuracy of chest radiographs for lung opacification caused by COVID-19, we additionally collected 20 chest radiographs as controls from 20 patients at a single hospital who were under investigation for COVID-19 (mean age, 32.0 years +- 13.7; male-to-female ratio, 9:11) but who had both negative PCR results and chest radiographs.\nImage Acquisition\nAll noncontrast CT scans were obtained in the supine position at full inspiration using a multidetector CT scanner with 16 or more detector channels (Emotion 16, Somatom Sensation 64, Somatom Definition, Somatom Definition AS+, and Somatom Force; Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany). The CT tube voltage and current were 120 kVp, and a standard-dose or low-dose setting with automatic exposure control was used according to institutional protocols. Axial CT images were reconstructed with a slice thickness of 1 mm (3 mm in a minority of the cases) and a sharp reconstruction kernel. Chest radiographs were obtained using the following devices: DRX-Revolution (Carestream Health, Rochester, NY); Optima XR220 (GE Healthcare, Chicago, Ill); Fluorospot Compact FD (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany); and CXDI (Canon, Tokyo, Japan). All chest radiographs consisted of single frontal view. Fourteen chest radiographs were taken at upright position with posteroanterior projection, and the remaining were taken with anteroposterior (AP) projection in supine position or sitting position.\nQuantitative CT Analysis\nAfter uploading CT images from each patient to commercially available segmentation software (MEDIP PRO v2.0.0.0; MEDICALIP, Seoul, Korea), a deep neural network (Deep Catch v1.0.0.0; MEDICALIP, Seoul, Korea) automatically generated a volumetric mask of the lungs, lobes, intrapulmonary vessels, and airways. An image technician made a tentative volumetric opacity mask by applying a variable density mask based on CT attenuation thresholds to contain the entire opacity. Then, the pulmonary and airway masks were subtracted from the tentative mask. The mask containing the entire opacity was separated by checking the connectivity across individual opacities, and the separated opacity masks were labeled in numerical order. A chest radiologist (S.H.Y., with 15 years of clinical experience in thoracic imaging) reviewed and confirmed the opacity masks. If any corrections were required, a manual adjustment was applied to the minimum extent necessary (Fig 1a). In addition, the radiologist recorded whether the individual opacities showed AP overlap with the heart or hilum, or if located below the diaphragmatic dome or above the top of the aortic arch on CT, as opacities in these locations often tend to be less visible on radiographs.\nCoronal CT (a) volume/polygonal rendering, (b) anteroposterior projection image, (c) and anteroposterior chest radiograph (d) in a 55-year-old male patient with coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia.

The quantitative CT opacity mass (QCTmass) was defined as the density of lung opacities multiplied by 1.065 (g/mL) and by the combined 3D volume (cm3) of the individual opacities in the whole CT scan. As lung opacities typically had attenuation values below zero, the attenuation values were converted to the density of lung tissue by adding 1000 to the attenuation values of each voxel and dividing by 1000. The attenuations in the range from air (-1024 HU) to water (0 HU) were approximately equal to the physical densities, and the density of the lung tissue was assumed to be 1.065 g/mL.\nRadiograph Interpretation\nEight thoracic radiologists (H.C., J.H.H., H. Ko, E.J.H., C.H.L., K.H.K., H. Kim, and J.M.G., with 5 years to 23 years of clinical experience in thoracic imaging) reviewed 40 anonymized chest radiographs (20 radiographs of patients with COVID-19 and 20 control radiographs) in a random order. The readers independently rated the presence of opacities on the radiographs using a clinical picture archiving and communication system workstation, using a five-point Likert scale (1, definitely absent; 2, probable absent; 3, uncertain; 4, probably present; 5, definitely present). They also recorded the location and type of each opacity (consolidation or GGO) when assigning a rating higher than 3.\nComparisons between CT Images and Radiographs\nThe lung and opacity 3D masks (Fig 1b) on CT images were displayed in different color renderings and viewed as a single image in the AP projection, enabling the estimation of the two-dimensional (2D) area (cm2) on chest radiographs (Fig 1c). A opacity on a CT image was considered to be visible on a chest radiograph if at least three of the eight readers agreed that it was probably or definitely present, and if the recorded location of the opacity on the chest radiograph matched the location of the projected image. In cases where opacities were visible, a radiologist (H.C.) who was blinded to the CT images manually drew a free-hand region of interest on the chest radiographs. For two additional cases of radiograph and CT image comparison, see Figures E1 and E2 (supplement).\nStatistical Analysis\nThe diagnostic performance of the readers on chest radiographs was evaluated through a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, with a Likert score for pulmonary opacity of 4 or 5 as evidence for COVID-19. The relationship between opacity 3D volume and 2D area was assessed by calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient (r). The quantitative parameters were compared using the Mann-Whitney test and the Fisher exact test according to the visibility of opacities on chest radiographs at the patient and lung level. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to evaluate factors affecting opacity visibility on chest radiographs at the opacity level. All statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS software (version 25.0, IBM, Armonk, NY).\nResults\nCT Opacification in COVID-19\nA total of 186 opacities were identified in 20 patients, with an average number of 9.4 +- 8.1 opacities per patient. Table 1 shows the results of the quantitative CT analysis in the 20 patients with COVID-19. The mean QCTmass per patient was 72.4 g +- 120.8 (range, 0.7 to 420.7 g). The mean relative 3D extent of opacities in the lung parenchyma per patient was 3.2% +- 5.8 of the total lung volume (range, 0.1%-19.8%). The mean CT attenuation of all opacities per patient was -448.2 HU +- 173.1 (range, -777.0 to -127.0 HU). The mean QCTmass per opacity was 7.3 g +- 19.5 (range, 0.005 to 111.9 g). The mean attenuation per opacity was -492.4 HU +- 168.8 (range, -816.0 to -126.0 HU). The mean 3D volume of the opacities was 13.2 cm3 +- 35.2 (range, 0.02 to 185.8 cm3).\nQuantitative CT Analysis of Segmented Opacities\nReader Performance for Detecting COVID-19-related Opacities on Chest Radiographs\nThe median sensitivity among readers was 25% (interquartile range [IQR], 20%-26.3%), and the median specificity was 90% (IQR, 88.8%-96.3%) with a median area under the curve of 0.575 (range, 0.525 to 0.725) (Fig 2). Four of the 20 chest radiographs with opacities on CT were correctly diagnosed by all readers, and nine chest radiographs with opacities on CT were missed by all readers. The median number of positive calls on chest radiographs was four (IQR, 3 to 4.75).\nReceiver operating characteristic curve analysis of observer performance for detecting pneumonia.\nReceiver operating characteristic curve analysis of observer performance for detecting pneumonia.\nLung Area and Relative Opacity Extent on AP Projection View\nOn AP projections of the CT images, the average relative opacity extent per patient was 13.9% +- 18.0 (range, 0.5%-57.8%). In the 20 patients, the Pearson correlation coefficient between the 2D area on the AP projection view and the 3D volume on chest CT was 0.978 on a per-patient basis and 0.901 on a per-opacity basis (P &lt; .001). The correlation coefficient between the 2D area on the AP projection view and the QCTmass was 0.878 on a per-patient basis and 0.847 on a per-opacity basis (all P &lt; .001) (Fig 3).\nScatterplots comparing the two-dimensional opacity area (in cm2) and three-dimensional (3D) volume (in cm3) and quantitative opacity mass (in grams) at CT on a (a, b) per-patient and (c, d) per-opacity basis.\nScatterplots comparing the two-dimensional opacity area (in cm2) and three-dimensional (3D) volume (in cm3) and quantitative opacity mass (in grams) at CT on a (a, b) per-patient and (c, d) per-opacity basis.\nScatterplots comparing the two-dimensional opacity area (in cm2) and three-dimensional (3D) volume (in cm3) and quantitative opacity mass (in grams) at CT on a (a, b) per-patient and (c, d) per-opacity basis.\nScatterplots comparing the two-dimensional opacity area (in cm2) and three-dimensional (3D) volume (in cm3) and quantitative opacity mass (in grams) at CT on a (a, b) per-patient and (c, d) per-opacity basis.\nScatterplots comparing the two-dimensional opacity area (in cm2) and three-dimensional (3D) volume (in cm3) and quantitative opacity mass (in grams) at CT on a (a, b) per-patient and (c, d) per-opacity basis.\nScatterplots comparing the two-dimensional opacity area (in cm2) and three-dimensional (3D) volume (in cm3) and quantitative opacity mass (in grams) at CT on a (a, b) per-patient and (c, d) per-opacity basis.\nScatterplots comparing the two-dimensional opacity area (in cm2) and three-dimensional (3D) volume (in cm3) and quantitative opacity mass (in grams) at CT on a (a, b) per-patient and (c, d) per-opacity basis.\nScatterplots comparing the two-dimensional opacity area (in cm2) and three-dimensional (3D) volume (in cm3) and quantitative opacity mass (in grams) at CT on a (a, b) per-patient and (c, d) per-opacity basis.\nComparison between Visible and Invisible Opacities on Chest Radiographs\nNineteen of the 186 opacities were detected on chest radiographs. The median proportion between the identifiable opacity area on the chest radiograph to the projected opacity area based on CT was 55.8% (IQR, 49.9%-57.1%). On a per-patient basis, the visible opacities on chest radiographs showed a significantly greater opacity extent and QCTmass than did the invisible opacities (P &lt; .033 and P &lt; .025, respectively). Five of the six patients with COVID-19 (83.3%) with a CT extent larger than 2% or a QCTmass of greater than 55 g had visible opacities on radiographs (Table 2).\nVisibility and Proportion of Identifiable Opacities on Anteroposterior Projection Images\nOn a per-lung basis, there were significant differences in the number of involved lobes, the number of opacities, the opacity extent, and the QCTmass (P &lt; .027, P &lt; .020, P &lt; .001, and P &lt; .001, respectively). Visible opacities on chest radiographs were detected in 87.5% (seven of eight) with a QCTmass greater than 55 g, and in 100% (seven of seven) of the lungs with a relative volume extent exceeding 4%. There were no significant differences in the mean attenuation between the visible and invisible opacities on both a per-patient and a per-lung basis (P &lt; .933 and P &lt; .636, respectively) (Table 3).\nComparison between Visible and Invisible Opacity on Chest Radiographs\nPredictive Factors of Opacity Visibility on Chest Radiographs\nLogistic regression analysis showed that the QCTmass (P &lt; .001) and 3D opacity volume (P &lt; .001) significantly affected the visibility of opacities on chest radiographs (Table 4), whereas no significant differences in opacity visibility were found according the mean opacity attenuation value (P = .618) or if the opacity was located in a predetermined less visible region (P = .309).\nLogistic Regression Analysis of Factors Affecting Opacity Visibility on Chest Radiographs\nDiscussion\nIn the current study, we performed a quantitative CT analysis to assess the radiologic burden of COVID-19. The mean attenuation of pulmonary opacities was -492.4 HU +- 168.8, and the attenuation was in accordance with the qualitative CT findings reported in the literature, according to which COVID-19 typically manifests as predominant GGO. The QCTmass and 3D opacity extent on CT per patient ranged widely, from 0.7 g to 420.7 g and from 0.1% to 19.8%, respectively, which is in line with observations of a diverse spectrum of disease severity in COVID-19. The diverse radiologic burden in COVID-19 cases with similar radiologic findings indicates that a simple qualitative description of CT findings (ie, predominant GGO in the peripheral lung) may be insufficient for the proper patient management.\nThe prevention of transmission and quarantine of infected patients are vital components of the management of COVID-19. Chest CT was extensively used for diagnosis and monitoring of patients under investigation for COVID-19 in China. Nevertheless, utilizing chest CT as the primary imaging modality for all suspected cases of COVID-19 has logistical limitations, in that disease is thought to spread from person to person, leading to time-consuming disinfection procedures and undesirable downtime of CT facilities, potentially overwhelming the capacity of radiologic services. On the other hand, although chest radiography is a more flexible imaging modality, widely available globally, the assessment of its performance in a head-to-head comparison with CT in COVID-19 was lacking. We found in this study that chest radiographs were remarkably less sensitive for detecting COVID-19-related lung opacities, despite its high specificity. Depending on the probability of infection in suspected cases of COVID-19, the use of chest radiography and CT scans can be appropriately balanced in each institution, considering the available resources of health care personnel, medical facility, and disinfection procedures versus the lower diagnostic performance of the former imaging method.\nOpacities were not only underdetected on chest radiographs, but also underestimated in size when compared with CT. Only about 56% of the opacities on the projected image were actually seen on radiographs. We found that the extension of disease was the main factor driving the visibility of lung opacities on chest radiographs. Therefore, clinicians and radiologists should keep in mind that a greater extent of disease can exist than that suggested by inspection of chest radiographs, and that chest radiographs may also have limitations for monitoring the disease extent.\nOur study had several limitations. First, the study population was relatively small. Second, as aforementioned, we solely evaluated the radiologic burden of COVID-19 and did not investigate correlations of radiologic findings with clinical manifestations or outcomes. Third, as cases were collected from multiple centers, the image quality and positioning of the chest radiographs were not consistent. Although such inconsistencies reflect real clinical practice, they may also have decreased the readers' performance. Fourth, although we excluded pulmonary vessels within the opacity as much as possible, residual intraopacityal vessels after segmentation may have increased the CT attenuation of opacities, potentially affecting the calculated QCTmass.\nIn conclusion, chest radiographs had low sensitivity and high specificity for detecting COVID-19-related lung opacities. The QCTmass and 3D opacity volume at CT, which are quantitative surrogates of disease extension, were significant determinants of opacity visibility on radiographs. It is crucial to properly understand the diagnostic accuracy and limitations of chest radiographs in COVID-19 to improve the quality of patient management by ensuring an appropriate balance between the practicality of chest radiography versus better diagnostic performance of CT scans.\nSUPPLEMENTAL FIGURES\nH.C. and X.Q. contributed equally to this work.\nDisclosures of Conflicts of Interest: H.C. disclosed no relevant relationships.

Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China5.\n This outbreak highlights the ongoing ability of viral spill-over from animals to cause severe disease in humans.\n","id":"PMC7094943","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing Group UK","authors":[{"firstname":"Fan","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Su","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yan-Mei","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wen","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhi-Gang","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Wu","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Wu","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jun-Hua","surname":"Tian","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan-Yuan","surname":"Pei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ming-Li","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yu-Ling","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fa-Hui","surname":"Dai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi-Min","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiao-Jiao","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Edward C.","surname":"Holmes","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong-Zhen","surname":"Zhang","email":"zhangyongzhen@shphc.org.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong-Zhen","surname":"Zhang","email":"zhangyongzhen@shphc.org.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.micinf.2020.01.003","date":"2020-01-24","title":"Measures for diagnosing and treating infections by a novel coronavirus responsible for a pneumonia outbreak originating in Wuhan, China","abstract":"On 10 January 2020, a new coronavirus causing a pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan City in central China was denoted as 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization (WHO).\n As of 24 January 2020, there were 887 confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV infection, including 26 deaths, reported in China and other countries.\n Therefore, combating this new virus and stopping the epidemic is a matter of urgency.\n Here, we focus on advances in research and development of fast diagnosis methods, as well as potential prophylactics and therapeutics to prevent or treat 2019-nCoV infection.\n","id":"PMC7102556","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Institut Pasteur.

P?&lt;?.\n01) was negatively correlated with the CT severity scores.\n The receiver?operating characteristic analysis demonstrated that area under the curve of CRP on the first visit for predicting severe COVID?19 was 0.87 (95% CI 0.10–1.00) at 20.42 mg/L cut?off, with sensitivity and specificity 83% and 91%, respectively.\n CRP in severe COVID?19 patients increased significantly at the initial stage, before CT findings.\n Importantly, CRP, which was associated with disease development, predicted early severe COVID?19.","id":"PMC7262341","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley and Sons Inc.","authors":[{"firstname":"Chaochao","surname":"Tan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fengxia","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kui","surname":"Tan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qionghui","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xixin","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaosong","surname":"Li","email":"lxsong0308@163.com","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.eclinm.2020.100375","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Eosinopenia and elevated C-reactive protein facilitate triage of COVID-19 patients in fever clinic: A retrospective case-control study","abstract":"Background\nCoronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently a pandemic affecting over 200 countries.\n\n Many cities have established designated fever clinics to triage suspected COVID-19 patients from other patients with similar symptoms.\n\n However, given the limited availability of the nucleic acid test as well as long waiting time for both the test and radiographic examination, the quarantine or therapeutic decisions for a large number of mixed patients were often not made in time.\n\n We aimed to identify simple and quickly available laboratory biomarkers to facilitate effective triage at the fever clinics for sorting suspected COVID-19 patients from those with COVID-19-like symptoms.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected clinical, etiological, and laboratory data of 989 patients who visited the Fever Clinic at Wuhan Union Hospital, Wuhan, China, from Jan 31 to Feb 21. Based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) nucleic acid testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection, they were divided into two groups: SARS-CoV-2-positive patients as cases and SARS-CoV-2-negative patients as controls.\n\n We compared the clinical features and laboratory findings of the two groups, and analyzed the diagnostic performance of several laboratory parameters in predicting SARS-CoV-2 infection and made relevant comparisons to the China diagnosis guideline of having a normal or decreased number of leukocytes (?9·5 109/L) or lymphopenia (&lt;1·1 109/L).\n\n\nFindings\nNormal or decreased number of leukocytes (?9·5 109/L), lymphopenia (&lt;1·1 109/L), eosinopenia (&lt;0·02 109/L), and elevated hs-CRP (?4 mg/L) were presented in 95·0%, 52·2%, 74·7% and 86·7% of COVID-19 patients, much higher than 87·2%, 28·8%, 31·3% and 45·2% of the controls, respectively.\n\n The eosinopenia produced a sensitivity of 74·7% and specificity of 68·7% for separating the two groups with the area under the curve (AUC) of 0·717.

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020.

This outbreak has infected all provinces of China and rapidly spread to the rest of the world. At the time of writing this article (March 16, 2020), there have been more than 158 countries and territories affected. Whole-genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis reveal that the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is similar to some beta coronaviruses detected in bats, but it is distinct from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-Cov) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).\nPatients with COVID-19 develop pneumonia with associated symptoms of fever (98%), cough (76%), and myalgia or fatigue (44%). CT imaging plays a critical role in the diagnosis and the monitoring of disease progression. The latest research studies described the characteristic imaging manifestations of COVID-19, including ground-glass opacities (GGO) (57 to 88%), bilateral involvement (76 to 88%), and peripheral distribution (33 to 85%). Other imaging features such as consolidation, cavitation, and interlobular septal thickening are also reported in some patients. However, these imaging manifestations of COVID-19 are nonspecific and are difficult to distinguish from other pneumonia. To our knowledge, there have been no studies explicitly comparing imaging and clinical characteristics between pneumonia patients with and without COVID-19.\nThe current diagnostic criterion for COVID-19 is the positive result of a nucleic acid test by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or next-generation sequencing. However, false-negative results caused by unstable specimen processing are relatively high in clinical practice, which has worsened the spread of the outbreak. Moreover, laboratory testing for SARS-CoV-2 requires a rigorous platform, which is not assembled in all hospitals. Thus, this requires specimen transfer, which may delay diagnosis for days. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial, particularly for critically ill patients who need emergency surgery, and with pneumonia complications. To solve these problems, we hypothesize that a diagnostic model can be developed based on CT imaging and clinical manifestations alone, independent of the nucleic acid test.\nIn this study, we identify the differences in imaging and clinical manifestations between patients with and without COVID-19. We also develop and validate a model for COVID-19 diagnosis based on radiological semantic and clinical features.\nPatients and methods\nPatients\nEthical approvals by the institutional review boards were obtained for this retrospective analysis, and the need to obtain informed consent was waived.\nFrom January 1 to February 8, 2020, seventy consecutive patients with COVID-19 admitted in 5 independent hospitals from 4 cities were enrolled in this study (mean age, 42.9 years; range, 16-69 years), including 41 men (mean age, 41.8 years; range, 16-69 years) and 29 women (mean age, 44.5 years; range, 16-66 years). All patients were confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing. Of these patients, 24 were from Huizhou City, 25 from Shantou City, 15 from Yongzhou City, and the rest 6 from Meizhou City. At the same period, another 66 pneumonia patients without COVID-19 from Meizhou People's Hospital were recruited as controls (mean age, 46.7 years; range, 0.3-93 years), including 43 men (mean age, 46.0 years; range, 0.3-93 years) and 23 women (mean age, 48.0 years; range, 1-86 years). All the controls were confirmed with consecutive negative RT-PCR assays. Figure E1 in the Supplementary Material shows the patient recruitment pathway for the control group, along with the inclusion and exclusion criteria.\nAccording to previous studies, whose sample size is comparable with ours, the ratio between primary and validation cohort is 7:3. In this study, a total of 136 patients were divided into primary (n = 98) and validation (n = 38) cohorts, close to 7:3. A total of 19 COVID-19 patients from two hospitals (6 patients from Meizhou People's Hospital and 13 patients from the First Affiliated Hospital of Shantou University Medical College) and 19 randomly selected controls from Meizhou City were incorporated into the validation cohort. The rest of the patients are incorporated in the primary cohort, including 51 COVID-19 patients from Huizhou, Yongzhou, and Shantou cities and 47 controls from Meizhou City. The primary cohort was utilized to select the most valuable features and build the predictive model, and the validation cohort was used to evaluate and validate the performance of the model.\nImage and clinical data collection\nThe chest CT imaging data without contrast material enhancement were obtained from multiple hospitals with different CT systems, including GE CT Discovery 750 HD (General Electric Company), SCENARIA 64 CT (Hitachi Medical), Philips Ingenuity CT (PHILIPS), and Siemens SOMATOM Definition AS (Siemens). All images were reconstructed into 1-mm slices with a slice gap of 0.8 mm. Detailed acquisition parameters were summarized in the Supplementary Material (Table E1).\nThe clinical history, nursing records, and laboratory findings were reviewed for all patients. Clinical characteristics, including demographic information, daily body temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, clinical symptoms, and history of exposure to epidemic centers, were collected. Total white blood cell (WBC) counts, lymphocyte counts, ratio of lymphocyte, neutrophil count, ratio of neutrophil, procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein level (CRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were measured. All threshold values chosen for laboratory metrics were based on the normal ranges set by each individual hospital.\nImage analysis\nA 23-year-old female with a travel history to Wuhan presenting with fever. Axial noncontrast CT image shows a consolidation with ground-glass opacities in the peripheral region by the right upper lobe. Air bronchogram is found in lesion. The maximum diameter of lesion is 2.8 cm. The right upper lobe score is 1 because of the involved lung parenchyma less than 1/4\nFor extraction of radiological semantic features, two senior radiologists (D.L. and X.C., more than 15 years of experience) reached a consensus, blinded to clinical and laboratory findings. The radiological semantic features included both qualitative and quantitative imaging features. The lesions in the outer third of the lung were defined as peripheral, and lesions in the inner two-thirds of the lung were defined as central. The progression of COVID-19 lesions within each lung lobe was evaluated by scoring each lobe from 0 to 4, corresponding to normal, 1~25% infection, 26~50% infection, 51~75% infection, and more than 75% infection, respectively. The scores were combined for all five lobes to provide a total score ranging from 0 to 20. A total of 41 radiological features (26 quantitative and 15 qualitative) were extracted for the analysis. The descriptions of radiological semantic features are listed in the Supplementary Material (Table E2). Figure 1 is one example of the evaluation of CT imaging.\nClinical and radiological feature selection\nTo obtain the most valuable clinical and radiological semantic features, statistical analysis, univariate analysis, and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method were performed. In statistical analysis, the chi-square test, the Kruskal-Wallis H test, and t test were utilized to compare the radiological semantic and clinical features between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 groups. The features with p value smaller than 0.05 were selected. Then, univariate analysis was performed for clinical and radiological candidate features to determine the COVID-19 risk factors. The features with p value smaller than 0.05 in univariate analysis were also selected. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method was utilized to select the most useful features with penalty parameter tuning that was conducted by 10-fold cross-validation based on minimum criteria. Diagnostic models were then constructed by multivariate logistic regression with the selected features. The flowchart of the feature selection process for these models was presented in the Supplementary Material (Fig. E2).\nDevelopment and validation of the diagnostic model\nWorkflow of data process and analysis in this study. Radiological semantic features, including qualitative and quantitative imaging features, are extracted from axial lung CT section. The clinical manifestation and laboratory parameters are provided by electronic case system. Statistical analysis is performed for comparing the different features between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. Univariate analysis, least absolute shrinkage, and selection operator (LASSO) are further performed to determine the COVID-19 risk factors with p &lt; 0.05 in statistical analysis. Three models based on the selected features are established by multivariate logistic regression. These models include radiological mode (R model), clinical model (C model), and the combination of clinical and radiological model (CR model). The performance and clinical benefits of the prediction model are assessed by the area under a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the decision curve, respectively\nTo develop an optimal model, we evaluated 3 models by analyzing (i) the clinical features model (C model), (ii) radiological semantic features model (R model), and (iii) the combination of clinical and radiological semantic features model (CR model) by multivariate logistic regression analysis. The classification performances of the models were evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were also calculated. A decision curve analysis was conducted to determine the clinical usefulness of the diagnostic model by quantifying the net benefits at different threshold probabilities in the validation dataset. The development of decision curve was described in the Supplementary Materials. Figure 2 depicts the flowchart of the proposed analysis pipeline described above. We also built a nomogram, which was a quantitative tool to predict the individual probability of infection by COVID-19, based on the multivariate logistic analysis of the CR model with the primary cohort. Depending on the coefficient of the predictive factors in multivariate logistic regression model, all values of each predictive factor were assigned points. A total point was obtained by summing all the points of each predictive factor. The scale also showed the relationship between the total point and the prediction probability in the nomogram. The corresponding calibration curves of the CR model in the primary cohort and validation cohort are shown in the Supplementary Material (Fig. E3).\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was conducted with R software (Version: 3.6.4, http: www.r-project.org/). The reported significance levels were all two-sided, and the statistical significance level was set to 0.05. The multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed with the &quot;stats&quot; package. Nomogram construction was performed using the &quot;rms&quot; package. Decision curve analysis was performed using the &quot;dca. R&quot; package.\nResults\nImaging and clinical manifestations between groups\nRadiological semantic features of patients in COVID-19 and non-COVID-19\nFeature	Non-COVID-19 (n = 66)	COVID-19 (n = 70)	p value	 	Number of pure GGO	 	  Total#	1.00 (0.00, 5.05)	3.50 (0.95, 8.05)	0.018b*	 	  Peripheral area#	1.00 (0.00, 4.05)	2.00 (0.00, 6.05)	0.032b*	 	  Central/both peripheral and central area#	0.00 (0.00, 0.00)	0.00 (0.00, 2.00)	0.001b*	 	Number of mixed GGO	 	  Total#	1.00 (0.00, 3.05)	3.00 (1.00, 9.00)	0.001b*	 	  Peripheral area#	0.00 (0.00, 2.00)	2.50 (1.00, 6.00)	&lt; 0.001b*	 	  Central/both peripheral and central area#	0.00 (0.00, 1.05)	0.00 (0.00, 2.00)	0.657b	 	Total number of consolidation	 	  Consolidation#	1.00 (0.00, 3.00)	0.00 (0.00, 0.05)	0.001b*	 	  Pure solid nodules#	0.00 (0.00, 0.00)	0.00 (0.00, 0.00)	0.309b	 	  Solid nodules with GGO#	0.00 (0.00, 0.00)	0.00 (0.00, 1.00)	0.033b*	 	Total number of lesions	 	  Peripheral area#	5.00 (2.00, 9.05)	7.00 (2.00, 13.00)	0.112b	 	  Central area#	0.00 (0.00, 3.00)	0.00 (0.00, 1.05)	0.960b	 	  Both peripheral and central area#	0.00 (0.00, 2.00)	0.00 (0.00, 2.05)	0.582b	 	Interlobular septal thickening			0.009a*	 	  Negative	44 (66.67%)	31 (44.29%)		 	  Positive	22 (33.33%)	39 (55.71%)		 	Crazy paving pattern			&lt; 0.001a*	 	  Negative	60 (90.91%)	32 (45.71%)		 	  Positive	6 (9.09%)	38 (54.29%)		 	Tree-in-bud sign			&lt; 0.001a*	 	  Negative	37 (56.06%)	61 (87.14%)		 	  Positive	29 (43.94%)	9 (12.86%)		 	Pleural thickening			0.030a*	 	  Negative	46 (69.70%)	36 (51.43%)		 	  Positive	20 (30.30%)	34 (48.57%)		 	Offending vessel augmentation in lesions		&lt; 0.001a*	 	  Negative	55 (83.33%)	17 (24.29%)		 	  Positive	11 (16.67%)	53 (75.71%)		 	\nGGO ground-glass opacities\n#Results are median with interquartile range in parentheses, and the remainder results are measurements with corresponding ratio in parentheses\n*Data with statistical significance. pa: chi-square test, pb: Student's t test\nClinical features of patients in COVID-19 and non-COVID-19\nFeature	Non-COVID-19 (n = 66)	COVID-19 (n = 70)	p value	 	Sex	 	  Male#	43 (65.15%)	41 (58.57%)	0.430a	 	  Female#	23 (34.85%)	29 (41.43%)		 	  Age (years)	46.73 +- 25.00	42.93 +- 13.32	0.275b	 	Vital signs	 	  Systolic blood pressure (mmHg)	126.92 +- 23.07	127.07 +- 15.16	0.965b	 	  Diastolic blood pressure (mmHg)	77.74 +- 15.72	80.39 +- 10.51	0.254b	 	  Respiration rate (bpm)	25.20 +- 7.29	19.86 +- 1.90	&lt; 0.001b*	 	  Heart rate (bpm)	101.59 +- 20.36	86.06 +- 13.34	&lt; 0.001b*	 	  Temperature ( C)	37.61 +- 1.06	37.12 +- 0.83	0.003b*	 	Signs	 	  Dry cough#	56 (84.85%)	48 (68.57%)	0.025a*	 	  Fatigue#	8 (12.12%)	22 (31.43%)	0.007a*	 	  Sore throat#	6 (9.09%)	9 (12.86%)	0.483a	 	  Stuffy#	4 (6.06%)	2 (2.86%)	0.623a	 	  Runny nose#	3 (4.55%)	3 (4.29%)	0.731a	 	White blood cell count (x 109/L)	11.48 +- 5.36	5.27 +- 2.33	&lt; 0.001b*	 	White blood cell count category			&lt; 0.001c*	 	  Low#	0 (0.00%)	2 (2.86%)		 	  Normal#	27 (40.91%)	63 (90.00%)		 	  High#	39 (59.09%)	5 (7.14%)		 	Lymphocyte count (x 109/L)	1.57 +- 1.33	1.25 +- 0.68	0.086b	 	Lymphocyte count category			&lt; 0.001c*	 	  Low#	24 (36.36%)	32 (45.71%)		 	  Normal#	35 (53.03%)	37 (52.86%)		 	  High#	7 (10.61%)	1 (1.43%)		 	Neutrophil count (x 109/L)	8.97 +- 4.90	3.53 +- 2.17	&lt; 0.001b*	 	Neutrophil count category			&lt; 0.001c*	 	  Low#	3 (4.55%)	8 (11.43%)		 	  Normal#	23 (34.85%)	59 (84.29%)		 	  High#	40 (60.61%)	3 (4.29%)		 	C-reactive protein (mg/L)	69.30 +- 65.88	26.37 +- 30.97	&lt; 0.001b*	 	Procalcitonin (ng/mL)	3.36 +- 8.98	0.26 +- 0.84	0.007b*	 	\n*Data with statistical significance. pa: chi-square test, pb: Student's t test. pc: Kruskal-Wallis H test\n#Results are measurements with corresponding ratio in parentheses\nThe differences between patients with and without COVID-19 for all 67 features (41 imaging and 26 critical clinical features) are shown in Tables 1 and 2 and the Supplementary Materials (Tables E3 and E4). The differences between the primary cohort and validation cohort for the same features are shown in the Supplementary Materials (Tables E5 and E6). All characteristics except fatigue and white blood cell count in the CR model presented no significant difference between the primary and validation cohorts. A total of 1745 lesions were identified, with 1062 from the COVID-19 group and 683 from the non-COVID-19 group.\nFor imaging manifestations, 7 patients in the COVID-19 group showed normal chest CT (10%). COVID-19 patients have a greater number of pure GGO and mixed GGO than non-COVID-19 patients (p = 0.018 and p = 0.001, respectively). For pure GGO lesions, the differences are significant both in peripheral (p = 0.032) and in central areas (p = 0.001). However, the number of mixed GGO is mainly distributed at the periphery in COVID-19 patients (p &lt; 0.001), with no statistical difference in the central area. The consolidation lesions without GGO occurred less in COVID-19 patients (p = 0.001). More lesions are between 1 and 3 cm (p = 0.027), and fewer lesions are larger than half of the lung segment (p = 0.017) in COVID-19 patients. Other significant differences between the two groups include the pleural traction sign (p = 0.019), bronchial wall thickening (p &lt; 0.001), interlobular septal thickening (p = 0.009), crazy paving (p &lt; 0.001), tree-in-bud (p &lt; 0.001), pleural effusions (p &lt; 0.001), pleural thickening (p = 0.030), and the offending vessel augmentation in lesions (p &lt; 0.001). The lung score presents no significant difference between the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 groups.\nComparison of clinical features between the two groups of patients with and without COVID-19 is reported in Table 2. There is no significant difference in age and sex between the two groups. Significant differences are found in common symptoms between groups, including fever (p = 0.003), dry cough (p = 0.025), and fatigue (p = 0.007). The respiration rate and heart rate also show significant differences between the two groups (both p &lt; 0.001). Compared with non-COVID-19 pneumonia, the reduction of the WBC count is more pronounced in COVID-19 patients (p &lt; 0.001). The ratio of lymphocyte and ratio of neutrophil also show a significant difference between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 groups. Although lymphopenia was observed in 32 COVID-19 patients (45.71%), it is not statistically different compared with that in the non-COVID-19 group. C-creative protein (CRP) level and procalcitonin level are also significantly different between the two groups (p &lt; 0.001 and p = 0.007, respectively). Most COVID-19 patients present normal procalcitonin level (82.86%).\nClinical and radiological feature selection\nSelected features in C, R, and CR models\nModel and individual features	Coefficients	 	R, n = 8 (41)*		 	  Intercept	- 0.307	 	  Total number of mixed GGO in peripheral area	0.359	 	  Total number of consolidation	- 1.262	 	  Total number of solid nodules with ground-glass opacities	0.452	 	  Interlobular septal thickening	- 5.559	 	  Crazy paving pattern	3.566	 	  Tree-in-bud	- 2.548	 	  Pleural thickening	3.265	 	  Offending vessel augmentation in lesions	5.504	 	C, n = 7 (26)*		 	  Intercept	29.273	 	  Respiration	- 0.359	 	  Heart rate	- 0.054	 	  Temperature	- 0.289	 	  White blood cell count	- 0.175	 	  Cough	- 1.866	 	  Fatigue	2.855	 	  Lymphocyte count category	- 0.028	 	CR, n = 10 (67)*		 	  Intercept	45.117	 	  Total number of mixed GGO in peripheral area	0.108	 	  Tree-in-bud	- 1.853	 	  Offending vessel augmentation in lesions	6.000	 	  Respiration	- 0.583	 	  Heart ratio	- 0.084	 	  Temperature	- 0.536	 	  White blood cell count	- 0.471	 	  Cough	- 0.997	 	  Fatigue	- 0.228	 	  Lymphocyte count category	- 2.177	 	\nC, R, and CR indicate the predicted model based on clinical features, radiological features, and the combination of clinical features and clinical radiological features, respectively\n*n means corresponding selected features, and data in parentheses are total features.

Comparison of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves among the radiological mode (R model), clinical model (C model), and the combination of clinical and radiological model (CR model) for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in the primary (a) and validation (b) cohorts\nThe prediction models based on (i) clinical features (C model), (ii) radiological features (R model), and (iii) the combination of clinical features and radiological features (CR model) were developed. ROC analyses for the primary and validation cohort are shown in Table 4 and Fig. 3. The CR model yielded a maximum AUC of 0.986 (95% CI 0.966~1.000) in the primary cohort with the highest accuracy and specificity, which was 0.936 (95% CI 0.866~1.000) in the validation cohort. The AUC for the C model was 0.952 (95% CI 0.988~0.915) and 0.967 (95% CI 0.919~1.000) in the primary and validation cohorts, respectively. For the R model, the AUC of the two cohorts was 0.969 (95% CI 0.940~0.997) and 0.809 (95% CI 0.669~0.948), respectively.\nDecision curve analysis for each model in the primary dataset. The y-axis measures the net benefit, which is calculated by summing the benefits (true-positive findings) and subtracting the harms (false-positive findings), weighting the latter by a factor related to the relative harm of undetected metastasis compared with the harm of unnecessary treatment. The decision curve shows that if the threshold probability is over 10%, the application of the combination of clinical and radiological model (CR model) to diagnose COVID-19 adds more benefit than the clinical model (C model) and radiological model (R model)\nTo determine the clinical usefulness of the diagnostic model, we developed the decision curve (Fig. 4), which showed better performances for the CR model compared with that for the C model and the R model. Across the majority of the range of reasonable threshold probabilities, the decision curve analysis showed that the CR model had a higher overall benefit than the C model and R model.\nNomogram of the CR model in the primary cohort. TN_Mixed_GGO_IP represented the total number of mixed GGO in peripheral area. AVAIL represented offending vessel segmentation in lesions. N was a negative result, and P was a positive result. Norm represented normal. Note that in probability scale, 0 = non-COVID-19, 1 = COVID-19\nThe nomogram (Fig. 5) was developed by the CR model in the primary cohort, with the factors of the total number of mixed GGO in peripheral area (TN_Mixed_GGO_IP), tree-in-bud, offending vessel augmentation in lesions (OVAIL), respiration, heart ratio, temperature, white blood cell count, cough, fatigue and lymphocyte count category incorporated. The total points were calculated by summing the points identified on the &quot;points&quot; scale for each factor. By comparing the &quot;total points&quot; scale and the &quot;probability&quot; scale, the individual probability of COVID-19 infection could be obtained.\nDiscussion\nIn this multi-center study, statistical analysis was performed in comparing imaging and clinical manifestations between pneumonia patients with and without COVID-19. Eighteen radiological semantic features and seventeen clinical features were identified to be significantly different between the two groups (p &lt; 0.05). Three models for COVID-19 diagnosis were developed based on the refined features. The models were validated in the both primary and validation cohorts and achieved an AUC as high as 0.986. These models will play an essential role for early and easy-to-access diagnosis, especially when there are not enough RT-PCT kits or experimental platforms to test for the COVID-19 infection.\nA total of 1745 lesions were evaluated for the qualitative feature, location, and size in this study. Consistent with the previous studies, the ground-glass opacities and consolidation in the lung periphery were considered to be the imaging hallmark in patients with COVID-19 infection. However, when we subdivided the GGO into pure GGO and mixed GGO, we found that the distribution pattern is different between these two lesions. Pure GGO show differences between groups in every location of the lungs, whereas mixed GGO only have significant differences between groups in the lung periphery. Recent studies defined four stages of lung involvement in COVID-19. Therefore, a follow-up analysis of these distributions would be significant. The lesion size in patients with COVID-19 infection was another interesting observation. Most lesions were between 1 and 3 cm, with few lesions larger than half of the lung segment, which was similar to the finding in MERS_CoV. Other features similar to MERS_CoV and SARS_CoV were observed in the laboratory abnormalities, such as lymphopenia, which may be associated with the cellular immune deficiency. However, our results showed no significant difference in lymphopenia between the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients.\nTo our knowledge, no diagnostic model based on imaging and clinical features alone has been proposed for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Our clinical and radiological semantic (CR) models consisted of the following features: total number of GGO with consolidation in the peripheral area, tree-in-bud, offending vessel augmentation in lesions, temperature, heart ratio, respiration, cough and fatigue, WBC count, and lymphocyte count category. The CR model outperformed the individual clinical and radiologic model. This result was in accordance with that in previous study in breast cancer, in which the model based on the combination of radiomics features and clinical features achieved a higher performance. Compared with the radiomics-based model, the extraction of radiological semantic features can overcome the image discrepancy caused by different scanning parameters and/or different CT vendors. A previous study also indicated that models based on semantic features determined by an experienced thoracic radiologist slightly outperformed models based on computed texture features alone.\nThere are a few limitations in this study. First, the sample size is relatively small because this is a retrospective analysis of a new disease and most of the cases outside of Wuhan City are imported. Second, with the multi-center retrospective design, there is a potential bias of patient selection, since there may be some deviations in marking semantic features among readers, though we have taken the effort to reduce this by creating pictorial examples and setting feature criteria (Supplementary Materials). Third, longitudinal CT study was not performed. Whether or not this model can be used to evaluate the follow-ups and help to guide therapy remains an open question to be further explored. Moreover, the rich high-order features of the CT image combined with radiomics or deep learning have not been studied, which may be another way to identify the patients with COVID-19. Besides, one can also focus on the role of radiological features in disease monitoring, treatment evaluation, and prognosis prediction.\nIn conclusion, 1745 lesions and 67 features were compared between pneumonia patients with and without COVID-19. Thirty-five features were significantly different between the two groups. A diagnostic model with AUC as high as 0.986 was developed and validated both in the primary and in the validation cohorts, which may help improve the COVID-19 diagnosis.\nElectronic supplementary material\nAbbreviations\nAUC\nArea under the curve\nC model\nClinical features model\nCOVID-19\nCoronavirus disease 2019\nGGO\nGround-glass opacities\nMERS-CoV\nMiddle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus\nR model\nRadiological semantic features model\nROC\nReceiver operating characteristic\nRT-PCR\nReverse transcription polymerase chain reaction\nSARS-Cov\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus\nSARS-CoV-2\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\nPublisher's note\nSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.\nXiaofeng Chen and Yanyan Tang contributed equally to this work.\nFunding information\nThis study has received funding by the Natural Science Foundation of China (grant numbers 81471730, 31870981) to R.W.; the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province (grant number 2018A030307057) to Z.D.; and the Special Project on Prevention and Control of COVID-19 for Colleges and Universities in Guangdong Province (grant number 2020KZDZX1085) to Z.D.\nCompliance with ethical standards\nGuarantor\nThe scientific guarantor of this publication is Zhuozhi Dai.\nConflict of interest\nOne of the authors of this manuscript (Yuting Liao) is an employee of GE Healthcare.

affected labyrinths of 24 patients with MD were compared to the MRI scans of labyrinths of 29 patients with an idiopathic asymmetrical sensorineural hearing loss.\n\n The 1.5- and 3-T MRI scans had been previously made in a clinical setting between 2008 and 2015. 3D Slicer 4.4 was used to extract several substructures of the labyrinth.\n\n A quantitative analysis of the normalized radiomic image

uses 64 T1-weighted MRI scans acquired from two groups of subjects: 28 typical age range subjects 4–15 years old (14 ASD and 14 DC, age-matched), and 36 non-typical age range subjects 10–24 years old (20 ASD and 16 DC).\n\n GLCM matrices are computed from manually labeled hippocampus and amygdala regions, and then encoded as texture features by applying 11 standard Haralick quantifier

Regional Cerebral Blood Flow in Normal-Appearing White Matter Is Associated with the Severity of White Matter Lesions in Elderly: A Xeon-CT Study","abstract":"White matter lesions (WMLs) in normal elderly are related to chronic ischemia, and progression of WML occurs mostly in moderate to severe disease.\n However, the mechanism is uncertain.\n Thus, we enrolled fifty-six normal elderly patients without large artery disease.\n The severity of WML on MRI was graded as grade 0, I, II and III using the modified Fazekas scale.\n Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured by Xenon-CT.\n We found that CBF (mL/100 g/min) within periventricular lesions and in the right and left centrum semiovales were 20.33, 21.27 and 21.03, respectively, in group I; 16.33, 15.55 and 15.91, respectively, in group II; and 14.05, 14.46 and 14.23, respectively, in group III.\n CBF of normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) around periventricular areas and in the right and left centrum semiovales were 20.79, 22.26 and 22.15, respectively, in group 0; 21.12, 22.17 and 22.25, respectively, in group I; 18.02, 19.45 and 19.62, respectively, in group II; and 16.38, 18.18 and 16.74, respectively, in group III.\n Significant reductions in CBF were observed not only within lesions but also in NAWM surrounding the lesions.\n In addition, CBF was reduced significantly within lesions compared to NAWM of the same grade.\n Furthermore, CBF was reduced significantly in NAWM in grades II and III when compared to grades 0 and I.\n Our finding indicates that ischemia may play a role in the pathogenesis of WML.\n Additionally, our finding provides an alternative explanation for finding that the progression of WML occurred more commonly in patients with moderate to severe WML.\n","id":"PMC4234500","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

in Healthy Older Adults Are Differentially Related to Macro- and Microstructural White Matter Characteristics of the Cerebral Lobes","abstract":"Aging is associated with microstructural white matter (WM) changes.\n WM microstructural characteristics, measured with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), are different in normal appearing white matter (NAWM) and WM hyperintensities (WMH).\n It is largely unknown how the microstructural properties of WMH are associated with cognition and if there are regional effects for specific cognitive domains.\n We therefore examined within 200 healthy older participants (a) differences in microstructural characteristics of NAWM and WMH per cerebral lobe; and (b) the association of macrostructural (WMH volume) and microstructural characteristics (within NAWM and WMH separately) of each lobe with measures of executive function and processing speed.\n Multi-modal imaging (i.\ne.\n, T1, DTI, and FLAIR) was used to assess WM properties.\n The Stroop and the Trail Making Test were used to measure inhibition, task-switching (both components of executive function), and processing speed.\n We observed that age was associated with deterioration of white matter microstructure of the NAWM, most notably in the frontal lobe.\n Older participants had larger WMH volumes and lowest fractional anisotropy values within WMH were found in the frontal lobe.\n Task-switching was associated with cerebral NAWM volume and NAWM volume of all lobes.\n Processing speed was associated with total NAWM volume, and microstructural properties of parietal NAWM, the parietal WMH, and the temporal NAWM.\n Task-switching was related to microstructural properties of WMH of the frontal lobe and WMH volume of the parietal lobe.\n Our results confirm that executive functioning and processing speed are uniquely associated with macro- and microstructural properties of NAWM and WMH.\n We further demonstrate for the first time that these relationships differ by lobar region.\n This warrants the consideration of these distinct WM indices when investigating cognitive function.\n","id":"PMC5715235","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Frontiers Media

(DTI) parameters.\n In parallel, White Matter Hyperintensities (WMH) as observed on a T2-weighted MRI are extremely common in older individuals.\n However, few studies have investigated both phenomena conjointly.\n The present study investigates aging effects on DTI parameters in absence and in presence of WMH.\n Diffusion maps were constructed based on 21 directions DTI scans of young adults (n = 19, mean age = 33 SD = 7.4) and two age-matched groups of older adults, one presenting low-level-WMH (n = 20, mean age = 78, SD = 3.2) and one presenting high-level-WMH (n = 20, mean age = 79, SD = 5.4).\n Older subjects with low-level-WMH presented modifications of DTI parameters in comparison to younger subjects, fitting with the DTI pattern classically described in aging, i.\ne.\n, Fractional Anisotropy (FA) decrease/Radial Diffusivity (RD) increase.\n Furthermore, older subjects with high-level-WMH showed higher DTI modifications in Normal Appearing White Matter (NAWM) in comparison to those with low-level-WMH.\n Finally, in older subjects with high-level-WMH, FA, and RD values of NAWM were associated with to WMH burden.\n Therefore, our findings suggest that DTI modifications and the presence of WMH would be two inter-dependent processes but occurring within different temporal windows.\n DTI changes would reflect the early phase of white matter changes and WMH would appear as a consequence of those changes.\n","id":"PMC4718031","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Frontiers Media

developed to predict tumor invasiveness using quantitative and qualitative features of pulmonary ground-glass nodules (GGNs) on chest CT.\n\n\n Materials and Methods\n A total of 599 GGNs [including 202 preinvasive lesions and 397 minimally invasive and invasive pulmonary adenocarcinomas (IPAs)] were evaluated using univariate, multivariate, and logistic regression analyses to construct a radiomics model that predicted invasiveness of GGNs.\n\n In primary cohort (comprised of patients scanned from August 2012 to July 2016), preinvasive lesions were distinguished from IPAs based on pure or mixed density (PM), lesion shape, lobulated border, and pleural retraction and 35 other quantitative parameters (P &lt;0.05) using univariate analysis.\n\n Multivariate analysis showed that PM, lobulated border, pleural retraction, age, and fractal dimension (FD) were significantly different between preinvasive lesions and IPAs.\n\n After logistic regression analysis, PM and FD were used to develop a prediction nomogram.\n\n The validation cohort was comprised of patients scanned after Jan 2016.\n Results\nThe model showed good discrimination between preinvasive lesions and IPAs with an area under curve (AUC) of 0.76 [95% CI: 0.71 to 0.80] in ROC curve for the primary cohort.\n\n The nomogram also demonstrated good discrimination in the validation cohort with an AUC of 0.79 [95% CI: 0.71 to 0.88].\n\n\n Conclusions\n For GGNs, PM, lobulated border, pleural retraction, age, and FD were features discriminating preinvasive lesions from IPAs.\n\n The radiomics model based upon PM and FD may predict the invasiveness of pulmonary adenocarcinomas appearing as GGNs.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6020660","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Hindawi","authors":[{"firstname":"Xing","surname":"Xue","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yong","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Yong","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qiang","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Feng","surname":"Cui","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Feng","surname":"Cui","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuqing","surname":"Lian","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Siying","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Siying","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Linpeng","surname":"Yao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Peng","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Peng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xin","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xin","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peipei","surname":"Pang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jianhua","surname":"Yan","email":"jianhua.yan@gmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Feng","surname":"Chen","email":"chenfenghz@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Feng","surname":"Chen","email":"chenfenghz@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1053/j.semnuclmed.2018.07.003","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Applications

leucoaraiosis: a review","abstract":"Leucoaraiosis (LA), also referred to as white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), are usually seen as patchy or confluent hyperintense areas on T2-weighted or fluid-attenuated inversion recovery MRI in the elderly.\n It is often asymptomatic in its early stages, yet its persistent evolution to more advanced stages may lead to substantial neurological dysfunction including dementia, stroke and death.\n Despite its clinical significance, the pathogenic mechanisms underlying LA development are uncertain.\n In patients with LA, the pathophysiological changes in white matter (WM) are suggested to be continuous from WMHs to its neighbourhood ‘normal-appearing white matter (NAWM)’ on conventional MRI sequences.\n Multimodal imaging studies revealed that the so-called ‘NAWM’ was actually abnormal with regard to underlying haemodynamic and microstructural changes.\n On the basis of positron emission tomography CT, xenon-CT, perfusion MRI, etc, the cerebral blood flow of NAWM was found to be significantly reduced in patients with LA, compared with healthy controls.\n Meanwhile, the integrity of microstructures and blood–brain barrier in NAWM was also demonstrated to be impaired with diffusion tensor imaging and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI studies, respectively.\n In addition,the integrity of NAWM correlated much stronger with cognitive performance than did WMHs load.\n It is reasonable to assume that the subtle injury of NAWM would be more reversible than WMHs themselves.\n Therefore, multimodal imaging modalities could be appropriately applied to future interventional studies targeting at early pathophysiological changes of NAWM.\n In this paper, we summarise current knowledge about NAWM of LA mainly acquired from multimodal imaging studies in vivo, and attempt to give options for future work.\n","id":"PMC5435207","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BMJ Publishing

cartilage, causing pain, swelling, and stiffness around the joint.\n It is the major cause of disability and pain.\n The prevalence of OA is expected to increase gradually with the aging population and increasing prevalence of obesity.\n Many potential therapeutic advances have been made in recent years due to the improved understanding of the underlying mechanisms, diagnosis, and management of

have the potential to improve cartilage recovery and ultimately restore healthy joints.\n However, despite currently available therapies and advances in research, unfulfilled medical needs persist for OA treatment.\n In this review, we focused on the contents of non-cellular and cellular therapies for OA, and briefly summarized the results of clinical trials for cell-based OA therapy to lay a solid

Particularly important are those studies that examine this issue in young unaffected adults and children before the development of disease.\n Despite some variation across studies, women appear for

on the clinical observation, males and females have different prevalence rates and severity levels of OA.\n Thus, sex-based differences may play essential roles in OA’s prognosis and treatment outcomes.\n To date, the comprehensive understanding of the relationship between sex and OA is still largely lacking.\n In the current study, we analyzed a published transcriptome dataset of knee articular cartilage (GSE114007) from 18 healthy (five females, 13 males) and 20 OA (11 females, nine males) donors to provide a slight insight into this important but complex issue.\n First, comparing female healthy cartilage samples with those of males revealed 36 differential expression genes (DEGs), indicating the fundamental sex-related differences at the molecular level.\n Meanwhile, 923 DEGs were distinguished between OA and healthy female cartilage, which can be enriched to 15 Reactome pathways.\n On the other hand, when comparing OA and healthy male cartilage, there are only 419 DEGs were identified, and only six pathways were enriched against the Reactome database.\n The different signaling response to OA in the male and female cartilage was further enforced by recognizing 50 genes with significantly different OA-responsive expression fold changes in males and females.\n Particularly, 14 Reactome pathways, such as “Extracellular matrix organization”, “Collagen biosynthesis and modifying enzymes”, “Dissolution of fibrin clot”, and “Platelet Aggregation (Plug formation)”, can be noted from these 50 sex-dependent OA-responsive genes.\n Overall, the current study explores the Sex as a Biological Variable (SABV) at the transcriptomic level in the knee articular cartilage in both healthy status and OA event, which could help predict the differential OA prognosis and treatment outcome of males and female patients.\n","id":"PMC8346087","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"MDPI","authors":[{"firstname":"Chenshuang","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhong","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Zhong","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nicola","surname":"Veronese","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nicola","surname":"Veronese","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nicola","surname":"Veronese","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Alfonso","surname":"Baldi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.rehab.2016.01.006","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Risk

traits.\n\n\nMethods\nPubMed and Web of Science were searched for the period from August 1, 2010, to July 31, 2014, for articles that included both male and female rats and that measured diverse aspects of brain function.\n\n Only empirical articles using both male and female gonad-intact adult rats, written in English, and including the number of subjects (or a range) were included.\n\n This resulted in 311 articles for analysis.\n\n Data were extracted from digital images from article PDFs and from manuscript tables and text.\n\n The mean and standard deviation (SD) were determined for each data point and their quotient provided a coefficient of variation (CV) as a measure of trait-specific variability for each sex.\n\n Additionally, the results were coded for the type of research being measured (behavior, electrophysiology, histology, neurochemistry, and non-brain measures) and for the strain of rat.\n\n Over 6000 data points were extracted for both males and females.\n\n Subsets of the data were coded for whether male and female mean values differed significantly and whether animals were grouped or individually housed.\n\n\nResults\nAcross all traits, there were no sex differences in trait variability, as indicated by the CV, and there were no sex differences in any of the four neuroscience categories, even in instances in which mean values for males and females were significantly different.\n\n Female rats were not more variable at any stage of the estrous cycle than male rats.\n\n There were no sex differences in the effect of housing conditions on CV.\n\n On one of four measures of non-brain function, females were more variable than males.\n\n\nConclusions\nWe conclude that even when female rats are used in neuroscience experiments without regard to the estrous cycle stage, their data are not more variable than those of male rats.\n\n This is true for behavioral, electrophysiological, neurochemical, and histological measures.\n\n Thus, when designing neuroscience experiments to include both male and female rats, power analyses based on variance in male measures are sufficient to yield accurate numbers for females as well, even when the estrous cycle is not taken into consideration.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13293-016-0087-5) contains supplementary material, which is

literature review to determine the extent to which sex is reported as a variable in cardiovascular studies on cultured cells.\n\n\nMethods\nArticles from 10 cardiovascular journals with high impact factors (Circulation, J Am Coll Cardiol, Eur Heart J, Circ Res, Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol, Cardiovasc Res, J Mol Cell Cardiol, Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol, J Heart Lung Transplant and J

were excluded.\n\n\nResults\nUsing two separate search strategies, we found that only 25 of 90 articles (28%) and 20 of 101 articles (19.8%) reported the sex of cells.\n\n Of those reporting the sex of cells, most (68.9%; n = 31) used only male cells and none used exclusively female cells.\n\n In studies reporting the sex of cells of cardiovascular origin, 40% used vascular smooth-muscle cells,

joints such as articular cartilage, subchondral bone, synovial membrane, and ligaments.\n No therapy is currently available to completely prevent the initiation or progression of the disease partly due to poor understanding of the mechanisms of the disease pathology.\n Cartilage is the main tissue afflicted by OA, and chondrocytes, the sole cellular component in the tissue, actively participate in the degeneration process.\n Multiple factors affect the development and progression of OA including inflammation that is sustained during the progression of the disease and alteration in biomechanical conditions due to wear and tear or trauma in cartilage.\n During the progression of OA, extracellular matrix (ECM) of cartilage is actively remodeled by chondrocytes under inflammatory conditions.\n This alteration of ECM, in turn, changes the biomechanical environment of chondrocytes, which further drives the progression of the disease in the presence of inflammation.\n The changes in ECM composition and structure also prevent participation of mesenchymal stem cells in the repair process by inhibiting their chondrogenic differentiation.\n This review focuses on how inflammation-induced ECM remodeling disturbs cellular activities to prevent self-regeneration of cartilage in the pathology of OA.\n","id":"PMC3771246","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Hindawi Publishing

osteoarthritis than age-matched males.\n These observations indicate that fluctuating sex hormone levels in young females and loss of ovarian sex hormone production due to menopause likely contribute to observed sex differences in knee joint function and risk for loss of function.\n In studies of osteoarthritis, however, there is a general lack of appreciation for the heterogeneity of hormonal control in both women and men.\n Progress in this field is limited by the relatively few preclinical osteoarthritis models, and that most of the work with established models uses only male animals.\n To elucidate sex differences in osteoarthritis, it is important to examine sex hormone mechanisms in cells from knee tissues and the sexual dimorphism in the role of inflammation at the cell, tissue,

Chest CT sensitivity was high (97%) but with lower specificity (56%).\nSummary\nIn Rome, Italy, COVID-19 pneumonia is characterized by constant presence of peripheral groundglass opacities, associated with multilobe and posterior involvement, bilateral distribution, and subsegmental vessel enlargement.\nKey Results\n  In this prospective study of patients in Rome, Italy, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of CT for COVID-19 were 97%, 56%, and 72%, respectively, using RT-PCR as standard of reference.\n  On chest CT, ground-glass opacities (GGO) were present in 100% of patients with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19. 93% of patients had multilobe and posterior lung involvement; 91% of patients had bilateral pneumonia.\n  On CT, subsegmental vascular enlargement (more than 3 mm diameter) in areas of lung opacity was observed in 89% of patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia, with unclear etiology.\nIntroduction\nA novel coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) was identified related to the new emerging viral pneumonia consequently named COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019). In accordance to the guidelines, the reference standard for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is next-generation sequencing or real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) methods applied to respiratory tract specimens. However, due to intrinsic limitations (i.e. collection and transportation of samples and diagnostic kit performance), sensitivity of RT-PCR at initial presentation ranges between 60% and 71%.\nAs reported by Ai, in a cohort of 1014 patients in Wuhan China, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of chest CT in the detection of COVID-19 pneumonia were 97%, 25% and 68% respectively using RT-PCR results as reference standard. Similar results were found in other studies, suggesting that CT imaging may be helpful in early detection of interstitial pneumonia in patients with high degree of suspicion for COVID-19 pneumonia.\nTypical chest CT patterns of COVID-19 viral pneumonia include multifocal bilateral peripheral ground glass areas associated with sub-segmental patchy consolidations mostly subpleural and predominantly involving lower lung lobes and posterior segments.\nThe aim of this study was to investigate chest CT features of patients with COVID-19 in Rome, Italy, and to compare the diagnostic performance of chest CT with RT-PCR.\nMaterial and Methods\nPatient Population and Study Design\nThis prospective study was approved by our local institutional review board (IRB) and written informed consent was obtained from all study participants. In case of inability of the patients to provide informed consent, it was received from the relatives or the admitting physicians who requested CT examination.\nConsecutive patients admitted at the Emergency Department of Sant'Andrea Hospital, were enrolled from March 4, 2020, until March 19, 2020. Inclusion criteria were (a) patients with fever and respiratory symptoms, such as cough, and dyspnea; (b) patients with mild respiratory symptoms and close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 patient; (c) patients with a previously positive test result.\nExclusion criteria were (a) chest CT with contrast medium performed for vascular indication (ie, pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection, coronary syndrome), (b) patients who refused chest CT or hospitalization, (c) severe motion artifact on chest CT.\nClinical Data\nAll patients underwent a prescreening questionnaire about COVID-19 symptoms in one of the six dedicated tents for COVID-19 located outside the Emergency Department collecting specific clinical information: fever, cough and dyspnea. Fever was defined with a temperature &gt;37.5 C. Thereafter, specific blood tests (COVID-19 panel, internal disposition) and nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were obtained for each patient. To confirm the positivity to SARS-COV2, real-time reverse transcriptase RT-PCR (Charite, Berlin, Germany) was used. All patients received two nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs at a time interval of 24 hours. Patients were considered negative after two consecutive negative RT-PCR results. Patient demographic characteristics, clinical signs and symptoms, and laboratory results were collected. Symptomatic patients (fever &gt;37.5 C, cough and dyspnea) with positive RT-PCR and positive CT were hospitalized, whereas patients with positive RT-PCR but negative CT (see below) and/or mild symptoms (fever &lt;=37.5 C, no dyspnea) were discharged for home isolation per our hospital guidelines. Data about hospitalization or home isolation were also collected.\nCT Acquisition Technique\nAs part of our hospital COVID-19 guidelines, after the RT-PCR swabs, all patients underwent chest CT to determine the presence or absence of viral pneumonia. All chest CT acquisitions were obtained with the patients in supine position during end-inspiration without contrast medium injection. Chest CT performed on a 128-slice CT (GE Revolution EVO 64 Slice CT Scanner, GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI, USA) dedicated only to patients with COVID-19 . The following technical parameters were used: tube voltage: 120 kV; tube current modulation 100-250 mAs; spiral pitch factor: 0.98; collimation width: 0.625. Reconstructions were made with convolution kernel BONEPLUS at a slice thickness of 1.25 mm. Decontamination of the room consisted of surface disinfection with 62-71% ethanol or 01% sodium hypochlorite. After each patient chest CT examination, passive air exchange was performed for 40-60 minutes.\nCT Image Analysis\nDICOM data were transferred onto a PACS workstation (Centricity Universal Viewer v.6.0, GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI, USA). Two radiologists in consensus with 15 and 25 years of thoracic imaging experience evaluated the images using a clinically available dedicated application (Thoracic VCAR v13.1, GE), defining patients as CT-positive when a diagnosis of viral pneumonia was reported.\nThe following CT features were also recorded: (a) ground-glass opacities (GGO), (b) GGO pattern, (c) GGO location, (d) consolidation, (e) multilobe involvement, (f) bilateral distribution, (g) location of consolidation or GGO, (h) pulmonary nodules surrounded by GGO, (i) interlobular septal thickening, (j) air bronchogram, (k) halo sign, (l) presence of cavitation, (m) bronchial wall thickening, (n) bronchiectasis, (o) perilesional vessel diameter, (p) lymphadenopathy (defined as lymph node with short axis &gt; 10mm), (q) pleural and (r) pericardial effusion.\nStatistical Analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 21.0 (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL). All continuous variables were expressed as medians and ranges and categorical variables as counts and percentages. The diagnostic performance of CT was evaluated with sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and diagnostic accuracy considering RT-PCR as the reference standard. CT findings for patients who required hospitalization versus home-isolation were compared by using the Pearson chi-squared test. P values of &lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant. A 95% confidence interval was provided by the Wilson score method.\nResults\nPatient Population and Clinical Data\nStudy population comprised 158 consecutive study participants (83 male and 75 female, mean age 57+-17 y, range 18-89). Fever was observed in 97/158 patients (61%). Cough and dyspnea were present in 88/158 (56%) and 52/158 (33%) patients, respectively.\nLaboratory blood tests on admission showed lymphocytopenia (defined as lymphocyte count &lt;1.1x109/L), with a lymphocyte count of 1.08 +- 0.47 x109/L in 95/158 cases (60%); increased (&gt;0.50 mg/dL) C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (13.64 +- 38.68 mg/dL) in 139/158 (88%) patients; increased (&gt; 220 U/L) lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels (339.50 +- 124.15 U/L) in 128/158 (81%) patients. Full results are reported in Table 1.\nClinical Data\nCT Diagnostic Performance\nSixty-two/158 (39%) patients had positive RT-PCR and 102/158 (64%) patients had positive CT findings. Detailed results are reported in Table 2. Using RT-PCR as reference standard, sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of CT for COVID-19 pneumonia were 97% (60/62)[95% IC, 88-99%], 56% (54/96)[95% IC,45-66%] and 72% (114/158)[95% IC 64-78%], respectively.\nDiagnostic Performance of chest CT for COVID-19 infection with RT-PCR as the standard of reference\nCT Image Analysis\nTo understand the CT features of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, a sub-analysis was performed considering only study participants with positive RT-PCR testing and chest CT findings. Of 158 study participants, 62 participants were RT-PCR-positive and among these, 60 participants were classified as CT-positive. Considering the exclusion of two study participants due to the presence of severe chest CT motion artifact, 58 study participants were evaluated in this subanalysis (Figure 1).\nFlow chart of the study.\nGGO were present in 58/58 patients (100%), multilobe involvement (&gt;= 2 lobes) and posterior involvement were both present in 54/58 (93%) patients, 53/58 (91%) patients had bilateral pneumonia distribution, and peripheral GGO location was observed in 52/58 (89%).\nA simultaneous involvement of all five lobes was observed in 43/58 patients (74%). Right lower lobe was the most affected in 53/58 patients (93%), followed by left lower lobe and right upper lobe involved in 51/58 patients (both 91%). Regarding GGO, three patterns were observed in order of frequency as follows: Crazy paving in 23/58 patients (39%), rounded morphology in 19/58 patients (32%) and linear opacities in 16/58 cases (27%).\nAn enlarged subsegmental vessel, defined as vessel diameter &gt; 3 mm, was observed in 52/58 patients (89%) with mean vessel diameter of 3.9+-0.6 mm. Consolidation was observed in 42/58 patients (72%) including 32/58 (55%) with subsegmental involvement. Presence of lymphadenopathy was reported in 34/58 patients (59%). Less frequent findings are shown in Table 3 and Table 4. Examples of chest CT findings are shown in Figures 2 and 3.\nCT feature in patients with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 infection\nCT feature in patients with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 infection\nComparison of chest CT features in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia versus those referred home for self-isolation (mild disease)\nAxial and coronal thin-section unenhanced CT scan of 65-year-old man with unknown exposure history who presented with fever and cough. (a) Chest CT shows diffuse bilateral confluent and predominantly linear ground-glass opacities with a pronounced peripheral distribution and consolidation with air bronchogram (black arrow). (b) Coronal thin-section unenhanced CT scan shows diffuse bronchiectasis of both lower lobes (white arrows).\nAxial and coronal thin-section unenhanced CT scan of 55-year-old man with history of recent travel to Milan who presented with fever and dyspnea. (a) Scan shows bilateral groundglass opacities with rounded morphology (white arrow) in both upper and lower lobes, and interlobular/intralobular septal thickening (crazy paving). (b) Scan shows predominantly apical ground-glass opacities with tubular size increase of segmental and subsegmental vessels (black arrow).\nChest CT features were compared between patients who required hospitalization (inpatients, 49 patients) versus those patients who were referred for home isolation (outpatients, 9 patients). There were no significant differences in chest CT findings between these groups (Figure 5, all findings p&gt; 0.06).\nDiscussion\nTo date, the majority of results evaluating the use of chest CT for COVID-19 pneumonia were of patient populations in China. We conducted a prospective study at our institution in Rome, Italy comparing chest CT to RT-PCR for COVID-19 infection. Two RT-PCR tests within 24 hours were used to confirm the presence or absence of COVID-19 infection. In 158 study participants, the sensitivity and specificity of chest CT was 97% (60/62) [95% IC, 88-99%] and 56% (54/96) [95% IC,45-66%], respectively. Typical CT features of COVID-19 were ground glass opacities (58/58, 100%), multilobe (&gt;2 lobes) and posterior involvement (both 54/58, 93%) and bilateral pneumonia distribution (53/58, 91%). On CT, subsegmental vascular enlargement (more than 3 mm diameter) in areas of lung opacity was observed in 89% of patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. There were no significant differences of chest CT features for individuals who with severe disease who were hospitalized versus those referred for mild disease referred for self-isolation, although the study size was small for this comparison (49 vs. 9 patients, respectively).\nOur results are in accordance with the systematic review performed by Salehi et al of 919 patients despite some interesting differences: our population showed a higher prevalence of pulmonary consolidations (72% vs 31%), GGO peripheral distribution (89% vs 76%) and ground glass opacities (100% vs 88%), respectively. Our population differs from that of Zhu et al. of 32 patients, where GGO was found in only 47% of patients with COVID-19. Recently, Chung et al analyzed a small population of 21 patients, showing a very low frequency of crazy paving pattern compared to our results (19% vs 39%, respectively). Mediastinal adenopathy was also much more frequent in our population (58%). In general, the patients in our study were somewhat older (mean, 57 years) with more men (52%) described in prior reports.\nAn interesting chest CT feature was the presence of enlarged subsegmental pulmonary vessels 89% of study participants. This finding was described by Albarello et al in two patients in Italy. Bai et al described subsegmental vascular enlargement in 59% of the patients with COVID-19 pneumonia versus those with 22% of those with non-viral pneumonia.. Ye et al suggested vascular enlargement may be due to pro-inflammatory factors. Subsegmental vascular enlargement could reflect the hyperemia induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection versus viral pulmonary infections such as SARS and MERS.\nThe diagnostic performance of chest CT in this study was in accordance with recently published data. Using RT-PCR as reference, we report a high sensitivity of 97%, moderate specificity of 56% and accuracy of 72%. This was similar to results from Ai et al reporting a sensitivity of 97%, specificity of 25% and accuracy of 68% in patients from Wuhan China.\nSeveral limitations should be addressed. In our setting, clinical and laboratory data were limited due to the urgency of the situation. Patient outcomes were not available at the time of this communication. The size of our patient study was limited.\nIn conclusion, typical pattern of COVID-19 pneumonia on chest CT in Rome, Italy was characterized by the consistent presence of peripheral ground glass opacities associated with multilobe and posterior involvement, bilateral distribution, and subsegmental vessel enlargement (&gt;3 mm).\nAbbreviations:\nSARS-CoV-2\nSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2\nCOVID-19\nCoronavirus Disease 2019\nRT-PCR\nreverse transcription polymerase chain reaction\nGGO\nground-glass opacities\nReferences\nClinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China\nNovel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) situation reports\nEvaluating the accuracy of different respiratory specimens in the laboratory diagnosis and monitoring the viral shedding of 2019-nCoV infections\nCorrelation of Chest CT and RT-PCR Testing in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China: A Report of 1014 Cases\nSensitivity of Chest CT for COVID-19: Comparison to RT-PCR\nEssentials for Radiologists on COVID-19: An Update-Radiology Scientific Expert Panel\nImaging Profile of the COVID-19 Infection: Radiologic Findings and Literature Review\nTime Course of Lung Changes On Chest CT During Recovery From 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pneumonia\nCT Imaging Features of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)\nEmerging Coronavirus 2019-nCoV Pneumonia\nInitial CT findings and temporal changes in patients with the novel coronavirus pneumonia (2019-nCoV): a study of 63 patients in Wuhan, China\nChest CT Findings in Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19): Relationship to Duration of Infection\nPerformance of radiologists in differentiating COVID-19 from viral pneumonia on chest CT\nDetection of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by realtime RT-PCR\nChest CT manifestations of new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): a pictorial review\nCoronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): A Systematic Review of Imaging Findings in 919 Patients\nCT Imaging Features of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)\nInitial clinical features of suspected coronavirus disease 2019 in two emergency departments outside of Hubei, China\n-novel Coronavirus severe adult respiratory distress syndrome in two cases in Italy: An uncommon radiological presentation\nAngiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a functional receptor for the SARS coronavirus\nSARS: imaging of severe acute respiratory syndrome\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome: temporal lung changes at thin-section CT in 30 patients\n","References depth 1":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/s0140-6736(20)30154-9","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome

mortality in critical illness: an observational cohort study","abstract":"Introduction\nThe neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a biological marker that has been shown to be associated with outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.\n\n Increasing quartile of NLR was statistically significantly associated with secondary outcome.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR is associated with outcomes in unselected critically ill patients.\n\n In patients with sepsis, there was no statistically significant relationship between NLR and mortality.\n\n Further investigation is required to increase understanding of the pathophysiology of this relationship and to validate these findings with data collected prospectively.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article

a major threat to public health1–3.\n Despite intense research efforts, how, when and where new diseases appear are still a source of considerable uncertainty.\n A severe respiratory disease was recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China5.\n This outbreak highlights the ongoing ability of viral spill-over from animals to cause

virus detection.\n\n\nMethods\nWe compared seven published real-time RT–PCR assays and two new assays that we have developed.\n\n To determine the analytical sensitivity of each assay, we constructed a synthetic universal control ribonucleic acid (uncRNA) containing all of the assays’ target regions on one RNA strand and spiked human blood or urine with known quantities of African or Asian Zika virus strains.\n\n Viral loads in 33 samples from Zika virus-infected patients were determined by using one of the new assays.\n\n\nFindings\nOligonucleotides of the published real-time RT–PCR assays, showed up to 10 potential mismatches with the Asian lineage causing the current outbreak, compared with 0 to 4 mismatches for the new assays.\n\n The 95% lower detection limit of the seven most sensitive assays ranged from 2.1 to 12.1 uncRNA copies/reaction.\n\n Two assays had lower sensitivities of 17.0 and 1373.3 uncRNA copies/reaction and showed a similar sensitivity when using spiked samples.\n\n The mean viral loads in samples from Zika virus-infected patients were 5?×?104 RNA copies/mL of blood and 2?×?104 RNA copies/mL of urine.\n\n\nConclusion\nWe provide reagents and updated protocols for Zika virus detection suitable for the current outbreak strains.\n\n Some published assays might be unsuitable for Zika virus detection, due to the limited sensitivity and potential incompatibility with some strains.\n\n Viral concentrations in the clinical samples were close to the technical detection limit, suggesting that the use of insensitive assays will cause false-negative results.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5153932","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"World Health Organization","authors":[{"firstname":"Victor

severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) during its emergence in humans.\n In spite of intense study, it remains unclear whether the deletion actually reflects adaptation to humans.\n Here we engineered full, partially deleted (?29?nt), and fully deleted ORF8 into a SARS-CoV infectious cDNA clone, strain Frankfurt-1. Replication of the resulting viruses was compared in primate cell cultures as well as Rhinolophus bat cells made permissive for SARS-CoV replication by lentiviral transduction of the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor.\n Cells from cotton rat, goat, and sheep provided control scenarios that represent host systems in which SARS-CoV is neither endemic nor epidemic.\n Independent of the cell system, the truncation of ORF8 (29?nt deletion) decreased replication up to 23-fold.\n The effect was independent of the type I interferon response.\n The 29?nt deletion in SARS-CoV is a deleterious mutation acquired along the initial human-to-human transmission chain.\n The resulting loss of fitness may be due to a founder effect, which has rarely been documented in processes of viral emergence.\n These results have important implications for the retrospective assessment of the threat posed by

infections in adults and children.\n While their clinical representation resembles that of many other agents of the common cold, their evolutionary histories, and host associations could provide important insights into the natural history of past human pandemics.\n For two of these viruses, we have strong evidence suggesting an origin in major livestock species while primordial associations for all four viruses may have existed with bats and rodents.\n HCoV-NL63 and -229E may originate from bat reservoirs as assumed for many other coronaviruses, but HCoV-OC43 and -HKU1 seem more likely to have speciated from rodent-associated viruses.\n HCoV-OC43 is thought to have emerged from ancestors in domestic animals such as cattle or swine.\n The bovine coronavirus has been suggested to be a possible ancestor, from which HCoV-OC43 may have emerged in the context of a pandemic recorded historically at the end of the 19th century.\n New data suggest that HCoV-229E may actually be transferred from dromedary camels similar to Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus.\n This scenario provides important ecological parallels to the present prepandemic pattern of host associations of the MERS coronavirus.\n","id":"PMC7112090","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Inc.","authors":[{"firstname":"Victor

European Virus Archive goes global: A growing resource for research","abstract":"The European Virus Archive (EVA) was created in 2008 with funding from the FP7-EU Infrastructure Programme, in response to the need for a coordinated and readily accessible collection of viruses that could be made available to academia, public health organisations and industry.\n Within three years, it developed from a consortium of nine European laboratories to encompass associated partners in Africa, Russia, China, Turkey, Germany and Italy.\n In 2014, the H2020 Research and Innovation Framework Programme (INFRAS projects) provided support for the transformation of the EVA from a European to a global organization (EVAg).\n The EVAg now operates as a non-profit consortium, with 26 partners and 20 associated partners from 21 EU and non-EU countries.\n In this paper, we outline the structure, management and goals of the EVAg, to bring to the attention of researchers the wealth of products it can provide and to illustrate how end-users can gain access to these resources.\n Organisations or individuals who would like to be considered as contributors are invited to contact the EVAg coordinator,

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7121484","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical
