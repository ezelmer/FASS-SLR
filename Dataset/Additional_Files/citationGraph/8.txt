(Renin-Angiotensin System Blockade Benefits in Clinical Evolution and Ventricular Remodeling After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation [RASTAVI]; NCT03201185)\nCentral Illustration\nThe coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is caused by a new coronavirus, the severe acute respiratory-syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). According to several investigators, the virus internalizes the cell by binding its trimeric spike protein to the human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2). Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibition up-regulates ACE2, which casts doubts on whether the administration of these drugs could predispose a patient to the disease or worsen the course of the disease. With this background, some investigators advise the discontinuation of RAAS blockers either with prophylactic purposes or, in infected patients, to avoid the evolution to SARS. On the other hand, high ACE2 levels have been shown to protect the lung in SARS, and a small series suggests an absence of a deleterious effect in hypertensive patients taking RAAS inhibitors with a decrease in the peak viral load and the inflammatory markers in patients under these medications. Moreover, the well-known cardiorenal effects of RAAS blockade in cardiovascular disease should not be dismissed, particularly in COVID-19 patients, in whom cardiovascular comorbidities favor a severe course of the disease.\nThe ongoing RASTAVI (Renin-Angiotensin System Blockade Benefits in Clinical Evolution and Ventricular Remodeling After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation) clinical trial is a randomized 1:1 open-label study involving 14 Spanish centers. Currently, Spain presents one of the highest rates of confirmed COVID-19 cases and of deaths per million in the world. The RASTAVI trial is investigating the effect of adding ramipril to the standard care in patients successfully treated with percutaneous aortic valve in terms of ventricular remodeling as assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance and in the major clinical outcomes.\nBy May 5, 2020, 3,525,116 people all over the world have been infected by SARS-CoV-2, whereas thousands of patients worldwide are taking RAAS inhibitors daily. In this scenario, we describe for the first time the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in high-risk patients from the RASTAVI trial who were randomly assigned to receive ramipril or standard care.\nMethods\nStudy population\nThe RASTAVI study is a national, multicenter, open-label, and randomized 1:1 trial aiming to determine the effect of ramipril on cardiac events, functional capacity, and cardiac remodeling on patients with aortic stenosis successfully treated with transcatheter aortic valve replacement. The first patient was included on March 26, 2018, and the study will continue recruiting until the end of 2021. Patients are randomized, after signing informed consent, between 1 and 5 days after transcatheter aortic valve replacement procedure to receive either standard care or an initial dose of ramipril (2.5 mg daily). Titration of the ramipril is performed at each monitored visit with the goal of a full dose (10 mg daily) if tolerated. Patients included in the control group if their blood pressure is beyond recommended parameters (140/90 mm Hg) receive any medication to control it, except for RAAS inhibitors.\nPatient Flowchart\nSchematic flowchart of the patients included in the RASTAVI (Renin-Angiotensin System Blockade Benefits in Clinical Evolution and Ventricular Remodeling After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation) trial and the interim analysis showing their rate of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and the mortality. COVID-19 = coronavirus disease-2019.\nAs of April 1, 2020, 109 patients have been included in the study (Figure 1 ). The aim of this non-pre-specified interim analysis is to investigate how SARS-CoV-2 infection has affected this high-risk population and to get further insight on the effect of RAAS inhibitors on the susceptibility to the disease. For this purpose, updated follow-up via phone calls and consulting electronic clinical reports was obtained for all patients. This follow-up was monitored and performed with the approval of the ethics committee.\nCOVID-19 diagnosis\nAll patients from the study were contacted by phone and a questionnaire was performed to determine the presence of symptoms (fever, cough, dyspnea, syncope, myalgia, or others) in the last 5 months, or contact with confirmed cases of the disease. Also, any admission in the last 5 months was recorded as per protocol, and the clinical reports as well as any laboratory exams were gathered. Confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection was performed through real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction of nasopharyngeal sample, and the test was performed as clinically indicated.\nStatistical analysis\nCategorical variables are reported as number (percent) and continuous variables as mean +- SD or median (interquartile range [IQR]), depending on variable distribution. Comparisons between those who were and those who were not developing COVID-19 were performed to determine pre-disposing factors.\nA Cox regression analysis was performed for investigating the effect of ramipril administration on the time symptoms of COVID-19 developed in the study patients. Ramipril was the only factor included in the analysis to avoid overfitting. Also, factors associated with mortality were estimated for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection comparing the characteristics of those who died and those who survived the disease. Pearson chi-square test and Fisher exact test were performed in comparisons between groups with qualitative variables, and Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney U test were performed for continuous variables. All tests were 2-sided at the 0.05 significance level. Statistical analysis was performed with IBM SPSS Statistics version 25 (IBM, Armonk, New York).\nResults\nCOVID-19 Symptoms Onset From January 1, 2020\nDevelopment of symptoms from January 1, 2020, according to the administration of ramipril or standard care. COVID-19 = coronavirus disease-2019.\nAfter careful assessment of the patients randomized in the study (Central Illustration ), a total of 102 patients (50 in the ramipril group and 52 in the control group) were included in this interim analysis. Of them, 11 patients (10.8%), presenting with clinical symptoms compatible with COVID-19, underwent SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction of nasopharyngeal sample with positive result, 5 of them from the ramipril group and 6 from the control group (p = 0.802). No other patients developed symptoms, but 7 of them had the SARS-CoV-2 test performed due to risk contacts and presented negative results.\nBaseline characteristics\nBaseline Characteristics of the RASTAVI Study Population According to COVID-19 Diagnosis\n	COVID-19-Positive (n = 11)	COVID-19-Negative (n = 91)	p Value	 	Age, yrs	86.0 (84.0-88.0)	83.0 (78.0-86.0)	0.019	 	Body mass index, kg/m2	26.3 (24.9-28.7)	27.1 (24.6-30.5)	0.580	 	Female	5 (45.5)	53 (52.8)	0.524	 	Hypertension	6 (54.5)	49 (53.8)	0.965	 	Diabetes	2 (18.2)	19 (20.9)	0.834	 	Dyslipidemia	6 (54.5)	60 (65.9)	0.512	 	Prior atrial fibrillation	6 (54.5)	22 (24.2)	0.066	 	Coronary artery disease	2 (18.2)	24 (26.4)	0.724	 	Prior myocardial infarction	0 (0.0)	6 (6.6)	0.635	 	Prior PCI	2 (18.2)	18 (19.8)	0.999	 	CKD, eGFR &lt;60 ml/min	4 (36.4)	29 (31.9)	0.744	 	Moderate or severe COPD	1 (9.1)	5 (5.5)	0.663	 	Peripheral vascular disease	2 (18.2)	9 (9.9)	0.338	 	Prior stroke/TIA	1 (9.1)	12 (13.2)	0.999	 	Prior blood test parameters	 	 Hematocrit, %	31 (28.6-33.4)	33.1 (31-36.6)	0.084	 	 Creatinine, mg/dl	0.90 (0.80-1.15)	0.80 (0.70-1.10)	0.470	 	 NT-proBNP, pg/ml	1,284 (918-1,894)	1,140 (522-2,724)	0.719	 	Prior treatment	 	 Oral anticoagulation	6 (54.5)	28 (31.1)	0.175	 	 Statins	6 (54.4)	61 (67.8)	0.501	 	 Oral hypoglycemic drug	1 (9.1)	15 (16.7)	0.999	 	Barthel index	92.5 (75.0-100.0)	95.0 (90.0-100.0)	0.584	 	NYHA functional class &gt;=II	11 (100.0)	78 (85.7)	0.351	 	EuroSCORE II, %	5.02 (3.90-5.95)	3.89 (3.20-5.26)	0.112	 	STS-PROM, %	3.90 (2.64-6.60)	3.06 (1.82-4.02)	0.065	 	Echocardiographic findings	 	 LVEF:Simpson's method, %	60.0 (50.0-65.0)	61.5 (56.0-66.0)	0.472	 	 Residual aortic regurgitation &gt;=3	0 (0.0)	4 (4.4)	0.478	 	 Residual peak aortic gradient, mm Hg	18.0 (10.5-21.0)	7.0 (4.5-9.0)	0.276	 	 Aortic velocity-time integral	17.0 (16.0-19.0)	22.0 (19.5-28.5)	0.071	 	 Septal width, mm	13.0 (11.5-15.5)	13.0 (12.0-15.0)	0.947	 	\nValues are median (interquartile range) or n (%).\nCKD = chronic kidney disease; COPD = chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; COVID-19 = coronavirus disease-2019; eGFR = estimated glomerular filtration rate; EuroSCORE = European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation; LVEF = left ventricular ejection fraction; NT-proBNP = N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide; NYHA = New York Heart Association; PCI = percutaneous coronary intervention; RASTAVI = Renin-Angiotensin System Blockade Benefits in Clinical Evolution and Ventricular Remodeling After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation; STS-PROM = Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality; TIA = transient ischemic attack.\nMain baseline characteristics from the 102 patients according to diagnosis of COVID-19 are summarized in Table 1 . Mean age was 82.3 +- 6.1 years and 56.9% were male. In those randomized to the drug, median time under treatment with ramipril was 6 months (IQR: 2.9 to 11.4 months), with all the included cases receiving the therapy at least for 1 month. Time from January 1, 2020, to onset of COVID-19 symptoms is presented in the Central Illustration. The prior administration of ramipril presented a hazard ratio of 1.150 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.351 to 3.768) for the development of COVID-19. Patients developing COVID-19 were significantly older (median: 86 years [IQR: 84 to 88 years] vs. 83 years [IQR: 78 to 86 years]; p = 0.019) and presented a trend to higher rate of prior atrial fibrillation and anemia. No significant differences existed regarding the rate of main cardiovascular risk factors between patients experiencing COVID-19 and those free of the infection, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia. Globally, there were no differences in major comorbidities including coronary artery disease, moderate or severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and chronic kidney disease. However, there was a trend toward worse baseline risk according to the Society of Thoracic Surgeons score (median: 3.90 [IQR: 2.64 to 6.60] vs. 3.06 [IQR: 1.82 to 4.02]; p = 0.065).\nMain features of patients with COVID-19\nMain Characteristics of the Patients Presenting With COVID-19 That Died According to Prior Randomization to Ramipril or Standard of Care\n	Group	 	Randomized to Ramipril	Randomized to Control	 	Patient #1	Patient #2	Patient #3	Patient #4	 	Baseline characteristics	 	 Sex	Male	Female	Female	Male	 	 Age, yrs	86	83	88	89	 	 Body mass index, kg/m2	27.01	30.67	29.2	31.12	 	 Hypertension	No	Yes	No	Yes	 	 Diabetes mellitus	No	No	No	No	 	 Dyslipidemia	No	Yes	No	Yes	 	 Smoker	No	No	No	No	 	 Coronary artery disease	Yes	No	No	No	 	 Chronic pulmonary disease	No	No	No	No	 	 Persistent heart failure	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	 	 NYHA functional class	III	II	II	II	 	 CKD, eGFR &lt;60 ml/min	Yes	Yes	No	Yes	 	 Moderate or severe COPD	No	No	No	No	 	 Atrial fibrillation	Yes	No	Yes	Yes	 	 Anticoagulation	Dabigatran	No	Apixaban	Edoxaban	 	 Peripheral artery disease	No	No	Yes	Yes	 	 Date of TAVR procedure	April 24, 2018	May 17, 2019	September 21, 2018	September 11, 2019	 	 Implanted TAVR device*	Evolut	Evolut	Allegra	Evolut	 	 Residual aortic regurgitation	I	0	I	0	 	 EuroSCORE II, %	4.55	3.08	9.32	6.63	 	 STS-PROM, %	3.95	3.84	12.77	6.60	 	COVID-19 features	 	 Fever	Yes	Yes	No	Yes	 	 Cough	No	Yes	No	Yes	 	 Dyspnea	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	 	 Specific COVID-19 treatment	L/R+HC+A+C	L/R+HC+A+C	L/R+HC+A+C	L/R+HC+A+C+T	 	 Days from diagnosis to death	15	17	12	21	 	 ICU admission	No	No	No	No	 	 Noninvasive mechanical ventilation	No	No	No	Yes	 	 Invasive mechanical ventilation	No	No	No	No	 	\nA= azithromycin; C = corticoids; HC = hydroxychloroquine; ICU = intensive care unit; L/R = lopinavir and ritonavir; T = tocilizumab; TAVR = transcatheter aortic valve implantation; other abbreviations as in Table 1.\nEvolut (Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minnesota); Allegra (New Valve Technology, Muri, Switzerland).\nImpact of BMI on Mortality\nBody mass index (BMI) in patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) according to mortality. The box shows the interquartile range and the T-bars represent the highest and lowest values (the range). The horizontal line in the box is the median. SARS-CoV-2 = severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2.\nAmong patients with COVID-19 (n = 11), fever was the most frequent symptom (63.5%), followed by cough (54.5%), dyspnea (27.3%), and myalgia (9.1%). Five patients presented with severe respiratory disease that required admission to a health care institution and specific treatment (lopinavir and ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and corticoids) as opposed to only symptomatic treatment in those who did not require hospitalization. Four of these 5 hospitalized patients (36.4% of the COVID-19 cases) died as a consequence of bilateral pneumonia with severe acute respiratory distress. The specific characteristics of each of the 4 patients who died are described in detail in Table 2 . No differences were found according to the drug randomization, with 2 of the patients undergoing RAAS-inhibitors treatment and 2 undergoing standard care. All of them presented with persistent heart failure despite successful treatment of their valvular disease. The only factor related to higher mortality in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 was a greater median body mass index (30.7 [IQR: 28.8 to 30.9] in those who died vs. 25.2 [IQR: 23.9 to 26.3] in those who did not; p = 0.039) (Figure 2 ).\nDiscussion\nIn the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, certain publications called for the discontinuation of RAAS inhibitors, both to potentially:we must not miss the hypothetical nuance:prevent the disease and to improve the prognosis in patients who were already diagnosed with or who were suspected of having COVID-19. This call for caution has prevailed in the medical community and the media despite the rise of discordant voices defending alternative hypothesis and has led the American College of Cardiology to issue a request for urgent research to clarify this aspect. Hypertension has been described as one of the most common coexisting conditions in patients admitted in hospital due to COVID-19, probably as a result of its higher prevalence in older patients. Often, this cardiovascular condition is treated with RAAS inhibitors, which explains the great clinical relevance of clarifying the potential role of these drugs in COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe main findings of our study suggest that: 1) age, but not hypertension, seems to be the only factor significantly associated with risk for developing COVID-19 in this comorbid population; 2) &gt;10% of the patients developed COVID-19 and one-third of them died, but the use of RAAS inhibitors was associated with neither risk for the clinically symptomatic infection nor poorer outcomes in the course of the disease; and 3) patients who died due to the infection presented higher body mass index as a unique and characteristic feature. Obesity is a frequent condition among patients who are hospitalized with COVID-19 and is present in up to 42% of those admitted to the hospital, but its influence in the prognosis has not been well described yet. However, experiences with other viruses, such as H1N1 influenza, suggest that patients with obesity, even of young age, may evolve toward severe alveolitis with respiratory failure and death. Therefore, this is not a minor finding and warrants future analysis and research.\nOutbreak of COVID-19\nAs of late 2019, 6 coronavirus species have been described to cause human disease. Four of them:229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1:are responsible for light or mild respiratory disease. The 2 other species can cause severe disease and were the causal agents of the 2002 SARS-CoV and the 2012 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus outbreaks. In early December 2019 in Wuhan, China, the first cases of pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were described. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction of lower respiratory tract samples allowed the sequencing of the genome of a novel ribonucleic acid virus with 79.6% of similarities with SARS-CoV, hence it was named SARS-CoV-2. Person-to-person transmission was rapidly described.\nInterplay of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2\nInterplay of RAAS and SARS-CoV-2\nHypothetic model of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) activation and severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) cell entry. (A) Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) converts angiotensin (Ang) I to Ang-(1-9) and Ang II to Ang-(1-7). When angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) are present, they prevent the conversion of Ang I to Ang II. Angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) act at angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R). (B) When A disintegrin and metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17) binds ACE2, it results in the occurrence of soluble (s) ACE2, which can no longer mediate SARS-CoV-2 entry and which might even prevent such entry by keeping the virus in solution. (C) The SARS-CoV-2 spike links to ACE2 and is internalized after priming by the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2).\nSARS-CoV-2 presents a spike protein to facilitate entry into target cells. It links to ACE2 and is internalized after priming by the transmembrane protease serine 2 (Figure 3 ). Membrane-bound ACE2 is part of a 3-enzyme system to convert angiotensin II to angiotensin-(1-7), with opposing properties to angiotensin II to achieve balance in the human body (Figure 3A). ACE2 is considerably similar to ACE, which converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II, and this second, not ACE2, is the target of ACE inhibitors. ACE2 is 2% in a soluble form:which is not valid for SARS-CoV-2 binding:after cleavage by A disintegrin and metalloprotease 17. Angiotensin I upregulates A disintegrin and metalloprotease 17, thus increasing soluble ACE2 levels (Figure 3B). Furthermore, A disintegrin and metalloprotease 17also mediates the release of membrane-bound precursors of proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-gamma, and interleukin-4) into the circulation. These cytokines down-regulate ACE2 cell surface expression reducing the capability of SARS-CoV-2 to cause damage (Figure 3C). The hypothesis suggesting that RAAS inhibitors might increase the susceptibility of patients who are taking them to COVID-19 and proposing the discontinuation of RAAS inhibitors has its basis in this pathophysiologic explanation. On the other hand, Meng et al. found lower interleukin-6 and peak viral load in peripheral blood and increased CD3 and CD8 T cells in patients with hypertension treated with RAAS inhibitors. Despite this contradictory evidence, the most recent clinical data suggest that the up-regulation of inflammatory cytokines by angiotensin II, which is harmful to the outcomes of patients with COVID-19, can be decreased thanks to the reduced formation of angiotensin II caused by RAAS inhibitors, thus explaining the better clinical outcomes detected by leading-edge research groups.\nClinical impact of management of RAAS inhibitors during COVID-19 pandemic\nThe recommendation of discontinuation of RAAS inhibitors was initially accepted by part of the medical community as a prophylactic measurement aiming to potentially reduce the risk of a severe respiratory disease. However, in this discussion an important issue was forgotten: loss-of-function experiments using ACE2 knockout mice have demonstrated increased susceptibility to myocardial infarction, hypertension and myocardial hypertrophy, microvascular complications, inflammation, fibrosis, diastolic and systolic dysfunction, and oxidative stress. Translated into humans, avoiding these drugs, where indicated, may increase major cardiovascular events causing more damage than the potential of increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2.\nTherefore, in view of the overwhelming evidence of mortality reduction in cardiovascular disease and the lack of impact found in our research, we believe that RAAS inhibitors should be maintained or even initiated in patients with new onset heart failure, hypertension, or myocardial infarction according to current guidelines as tolerated, irrespective of SARS-CoV-2 disease outbreak. The frequently updated information on the disease suggests that, not only has mortality due to COVID-19 has increased, but also other comorbidities are experiencing a rise in their mortality rates. Cardiovascular events are still the greatest cause of mortality in our society and inadequate handling of secondary prevention can have a catastrophic impact on the health status of the population. However, as pointed out by Vaduganathan et al., the effects on ACE2 should not be assumed to be uniform across RAAS inhibitors or even in response to therapies within a given drug class. For this reason, we need to remark that the current research only provided accurate evidence for ramipril and not for other drugs of this group.\nStudy limitations\nThe main limitations of the present study include its retrospective nature and the limited number of cases with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Detection of immunization should be undertaken as soon as confinement allows testing all patients in the trial to verify the real incidence of COVID-19 in this population, otherwise the real incidence of the disease remains unknown. Reporting this information in the near future is warranted but, still, reporting the impact of ramipril on prognosis of symptomatic infection is clinically relevant. The relatively short length of the follow-up precludes us from drawing further conclusions regarding the long term, but a continuous monitoring of patients at risk from the RASTAVI study will be performed.\nConclusions\n COMPETENCY IN PATIENT CARE AND PROCEDURAL SKILLS: In a subset of patients with hypertension after transcatheter aortic valve replacement who were enrolled in a randomized trial, the ACE inhibitor ramipril did not increase the risk of COVID-19 infection or adversely affect its prognosis.\n TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Studies of larger populations are needed to determine whether angiotensin II receptor blockers differ from ACE inhibitors with regard to the risk of infection after exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 or severity of COVID-19.\nMore than 10% of the high-risk patients in the RASTAVI population developed COVID-19 and one-third of them died. Older patients with higher body mass index presented higher risk of infection and mortality. However, the use of ramipril did not increase the risk of infection or impair the prognosis. Hence, the use of RAAS inhibitors during the COVID-19 pandemic seems safe. \nReferences\nCoronaviruses as the cause of respiratory infections\nEpidemiology and cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Guangdong, People's Republic of China, in February, 2003\nIdentification of a novel coronavirus in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome\nIsolation of a novel coronavirus from a man with pneumonia in Saudi Arabia\nClinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China\nA novel coronavirus from patients with pneumonia in China, 2019\nA pneumonia outbreak associated with a new coronavirus of probable bat origin\nGenomic characterization and epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding\nA familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster\nAngiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a functional receptor for the SARS coronavirus\nSARS-CoV-2 cell entry depends on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and is blocked by a clinically proven protease inhibitor\nTissue distribution of ACE2 protein, the functional receptor for SARS coronavirus: a first step in understanding SARS pathogenesis\nEffect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and angiotensin II receptor blockers on cardiac angiotensin-converting enzyme 2\nRenin-angiotensin system blockers and the COVID-19 pandemic: at present there is no evidence to abandon renin-angiotensin system blockers\nAngiotensin converting enzyme 2: a double-edged sword\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): do angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers have a biphasic effect?\nAngiotensin-converting enzyme 2 protects from severe acute lung failure\nRenin-angiotensin system inhibitors improve the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients with hypertension\nRenin-angiotensin system inhibition following transcatheter aortic valve replacement\nImpact of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors on clinical outcomes and ventricular remodelling after transcatheter aortic valve implantation: rationale and design of the RASTAVI randomised multicentre study\nCoronavirus Disease 2019: Situation Report-76.

representation resembles that of many other agents of the common cold, their evolutionary histories, and host associations could provide important insights into the natural history of past human pandemics.\n For two of these viruses, we have strong evidence suggesting an origin in major livestock species while primordial associations for all four viruses may have existed with bats and

have been classified as secondary, occurring from human-to-human transmission through contact with asymptomatic or symptomatic individuals infected with MERS-CoV.\n Hospital outbreaks of MERS-CoV are a hallmark of MERS-CoV infection.\n The clinical features associated with MERS-CoV infection are not MERS-specific and are similar to other respiratory tract infections.\n Thus, the diagnosis of MERS can easily be missed, unless the doctor or health-care worker has a high degree of clinical awareness and the patient undergoes specific testing for MERS-CoV.\n The largest outbreak of MERS-CoV outside the Arabian Peninsula occurred in South Korea in May, 2015, resulting in 186 cases with 38 deaths.\n This outbreak was caused by a traveller with undiagnosed MERS-CoV infection who became ill after returning to Seoul from a trip to the Middle East.\n The traveller visited several health facilities in South Korea, transmitting the virus to many other individuals long before a diagnosis was made.\n With 10 million pilgrims visiting Saudi Arabia each year from 182 countries, watchful surveillance by public health systems, and a high degree of clinical awareness of the possibility of MERS-CoV infection is essential.\n In this Review, we provide a comprehensive update and synthesis of the latest available data on the epidemiology, determinants, and risk factors of primary, household, and nosocomial transmission of MERS-CoV, and suggest measures to reduce risk of transmission.\n","id":"PMC7164784","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

them.\n In February 2018, WHO held an informal expert consultation to review and update the list of priority diseases, employing a prioritization methodology which uses the Delphi technique, questionnaires, multi-criteria decision analysis, and expert review to identify relevant diseases.\n The committee determined that, given their potential to cause a public health emergency and the absence of efficacious drugs and/or vaccines, there is an urgent need for accelerated R&amp;D for (in no order of priority) Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever, Ebola virus and Marburg virus disease, Lassa fever, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Nipah and henipaviral diseases, Rift Valley fever and Zika virus disease.\n The experts also included

and has no approved antiviral therapy.\n\n We aimed to compare ribavirin and interferon alfa-2a treatment for patients with severe MERS-CoV infection with a supportive therapy only.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective cohort study, we included adults (aged ?16 years) with laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection and pneumonia needing ventilation support, diagnosed between Oct 23, 2012, and May 1, 2014, at the Prince Sultan Military Medical City (Riyadh, Saudi Arabia).\n\n All patients received appropriate supportive care and regular clinical and laboratory monitoring, but patients diagnosed after Sept 16, 2013, were also given oral ribavirin (dose based on calculated creatinine clearance, for 8–10 days) and subcutaneous pegylated interferon alfa-2a (180 ?g per week for 2 weeks).\n\n The primary endpoint was 14-day and 28-day survival from the date of MERS-CoV infection diagnosis.\n\n We used ?2 and Fischer's exact test to analyse categorical variables and the t test to analyse continuous variables.\n\n\nFindings\nWe analysed 20 patients who received ribavirin and interferon (treatment group; initiated a median of 3 days [range 0–8] after diagnosis) and 24 who did not (comparator group).\n\n Baseline clinical and laboratory characteristics were similar between groups, apart from baseline absolute neutrophil count, which was significantly lower in the comparator group (5·88?×?109/L [SD 3·95] vs 9·88?×?109/L [6·63]; p=0·023).\n\n 14 (70%) of 20 patients in the treatment group had survived after 14 days, compared with seven (29%) of 24 in the comparator group (p=0·004).\n\n After 28 days, six (30%) of 20 and four (17%) of 24, respectively, had survived (p=0·054).\n\n Adverse effects were similar between groups, apart from reduction in haemoglobin, which was significantly greater in the treatment group than in the comparator group (4·32 g/L [SD 2·47] vs 2·14 g/L [1·90]; p=0·002).\n\n\nInterpretation\nIn patients with severe MERS-CoV infection, ribavirin and interferon alfa-2a therapy is associated with significantly improved survival at 14 days, but not at 28 days.\n\n Further assessment in appropriately designed randomised trials is recommended.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7106357","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Ali

coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.\n\n Increasing quartile of NLR was statistically significantly associated with secondary outcome.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR is associated with outcomes in unselected critically ill patients.\n\n In patients with sepsis, there was no statistically significant relationship between NLR and mortality.\n\n Further investigation is required to increase understanding of the

Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui Ming, Hui Hoy and Chow Sin Lan Charity Fund Limited, Marina Man-Wai Lee, the Hong Kong Hainan Commercial Association South China Microbiology Research Fund, Sanming Project of Medicine (Shenzhen), and High Level-Hospital Program (Guangdong Health Commission).\n\n\n","id":"PMC7159286","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Jasper Fuk-Woo","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shuofeng","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kin-Hang","surname":"Kok","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kelvin Kai-Wang","surname":"To","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hin","surname":"Chu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jin","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fanfan","surname":"Xing","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jieling","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Cyril Chik-Yan","surname":"Yip","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rosana Wing-Shan","surname":"Poon","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hoi-Wah","surname":"Tsoi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Simon Kam-Fai","surname":"Lo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kwok-Hung","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Vincent Kwok-Man","surname":"Poon","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wan-Mui","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jonathan Daniel","surname":"Ip","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jian-Piao","surname":"Cai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Vincent Chi-Chung","surname":"Cheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Honglin","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christopher Kim-Ming","surname":"Hui","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kwok-Yung","surname":"Yuen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30211-7","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study","abstract":"Background\nIn December, 2019, a pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China.\n\n We aimed to further clarify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020.

The combination of eosinopenia and elevated hs-CRP yielded a sensitivity of 67·9% and specificity of 78·2% (AUC=0·730).\n\n The addition of eosinopenia alone or the combination of eosinopenia and elevated hs-CRP into the guideline-recommended diagnostic parameters for COVID-19 improved the predictive capacity with higher than zero of both net reclassification improvement (NRI) and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI).\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe combination of eosinopenia and elevated hs-CRP can effectively triage suspected COVID-19 patients from other patients attending the fever clinic with COVID-19-like initial symptoms.\n\n This finding would be particularly useful for designing triage strategies in an epidemic region having a large number of patients with COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases while limited medical resources for nucleic acid tests and radiographic examination.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7196382","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier","authors":[{"firstname":"Qilin","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiuli","surname":"Ding","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Geqing","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Heng-Gui","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fenghua","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhi","surname":"Geng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Luming","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shijun","surname":"Lei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"An","surname":"Pan","email":"panan@hust.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin","surname":"Wang","email":"lin_wang@hust.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng","surname":"Wang","email":"zhengwang@hust.edu.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1001/jamacardio.2020.0950","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Association of cardiac injury with mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1001/jamacardio.2020.1017","date":"2020-03-09","title":"Cardiovascular Implications of Fatal Outcomes of Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)","abstract":"This case series study evaluates the association of underlying cardiovascular disease and myocardial injury on fatal outcomes in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n","id":"PMC7101506","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"American Medical Association","authors":[{"firstname":"Tao","surname":"Guo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yongzhen","surname":"Fan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ming","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoyan","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tao","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hairong","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Wan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xinghuan","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhibing","surname":"Lu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30566-3","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study","abstract":"Background\nSince December, 2019, Wuhan, China, has experienced an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).\n\n Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (?18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020.

effect of angiotensin?converting enzyme 2 and its effect on the prognosis of COVID?19","abstract":"This article reviews the correlation between angiotensin?converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and severe risk factors for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID?19) and the possible mechanisms.\n ACE2 is a crucial component of the renin?angiotensin system (RAS).\n The classical RAS ACE?Ang II?AT1R regulatory axis and the ACE2?Ang 1?7?MasR counter?regulatory axis play an essential role in maintaining homeostasis in humans.\n ACE2 is widely distributed in the heart, kidneys, lungs, and testes.\n ACE2 antagonizes the activation of the classical RAS system and protects against organ damage, protecting against hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.\n Similar to SARS?CoV, SARS?CoV?2 also uses the ACE2 receptor to invade human alveolar epithelial cells.\n Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a clinical high?mortality disease, and ACE2 has a protective effect on this type of acute lung injury.\n Current research shows that the poor prognosis of patients with COVID?19 is related to factors such as sex (male), age (&gt;60 years), underlying diseases (hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease), secondary ARDS, and other relevant factors.\n Because of these protective effects of ACE2 on chronic underlying diseases and ARDS, the development of spike protein?based vaccine and drugs enhancing ACE2 activity may become one of the most promising approaches for the treatment of COVID?19 in the future.\n","id":"PMC7317908","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley and Sons

ZPHL); 2) the ratio of the rates of their hydrolysis (ZPHL/HHL ratio); 3) the ratio of immunoreactive ACE protein to ACE activity; 4) the pattern of mAbs binding to different epitopes on ACE – ACE

prostate tissues of several patients diagnosed with BPH based on histology, also demonstrated decreased ACE activity and increased immunoreactive ACE protein/ACE activity and ZPHL/HHL ratios, that

cells exposed to angiotensin II (Ang II), leading to endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular disorders.\n Since von Willebrand Factor (vWF) blockade improves endothelial function in coronary patients, we hypothesized that targeting endothelial vWF with short interference RNA (siRNA) prevents Ang II-induced ET-1 upregulation.\n Nearly 65?±?2% silencing of vWF in porcine aortic endothelial cells (PAOECs) was achieved with vWF-specific siRNA without affecting cell viability and growth.\n While showing ET-1 similar to wild type cells at rest, vWF-silenced cells did not present ET-1 upregulation during exposure to Ang II (100?nM/24?h), preserving levels of endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity similar to wild type.\n vWF silencing prevented AngII-induced increase in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX) activity and superoxide anion (O2?) levels, known triggers of ET-1 expression.\n Moreover, no increase in O2? or ET-1 levels was found in silenced cells treated with AngII or NOX-agonist phorbol ester (PMA 5?nM/48?h).\n Finally, vWF was required for overexpression of NOX4 and NOX2 in response to AngII and PMA.\n In conclusion, endothelial vWF knockdown prevented Ang II-induced ET-1 upregulation through attenuation of NOX-mediated O2? production.\n Our findings reveal a new role of vWF in preventing of Ang II-induced

in the pathophysiology of coronary heart disease.\n The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)2-angiotensin-(1–7) [Ang (1–7)]-Mas receptor (MasR) axis is a key regulator in myocardial remodeling and development of heart failure.\n To investigate how ACE2-Ang-(1–7)-MasR axis function on myocardial remodeling and cardiac fibrosis in post-myocardial infarction (MI), male Sprague-Dawley rats (weight, 200±20 g) were used to establish the model of myocardial infarction by ligating the left coronary artery.\n The present study suggests that telmisartan (Tel) and olmesartan (Olm) (5 mg/kg/d) can inhibit myocardial remodeling of post-myocardial infarction through the ACE2-Ang (1–7)-MasR pathway.\n Administration of Tel or Olm was demonstrated to significantly inhibit collagen deposition using Masson staining.\n In addition, telmisartan and olmesartan was indicated to antagonize angiotensin II (Ang II) and upregulate ACE2, MasR, Ang (1–7) expression in myocardial tissue using immunoassay and ELISA test, and the effect of Olm was more marked than that of Tel at the same dosage.\n Simultaneously, compared with the MI or Sham group, the mRNA and protein expression of ACE2, Ang II and MasR in myocardial tissue demonstrated a remarkable increase in the Olm group, when compared with the Tel group.\n Taken together, our data demonstrated that ACE2-Ang (1–7)-MasR axis may present a potential protective role in the development of myocardial remodeling and may provide a new target for drug development of cardiac fibrosis.\n In conclusion, Olm is superior to Tel in inhibiting myocardial local Ang II level reducing myocardial collagen deposition and improving myocardial remodeling by upregulating the expression of ACE2, Ang (1–7) and MasR.\n","id":"PMC5561970","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"D.A.

ACE2 receptors are ubiquitous and widely expressed in the heart, vessels, gut, lung (particularly in type 2 pneumocytes and macrophages), kidney, testis and brain.\n ACE2 is mostly bound to cell membranes and only scarcely present in the circulation in a soluble form.\n An important salutary function of membrane-bound and soluble ACE2 is the degradation of angiotensin II to angiotensin1-7.\n Consequently, ACE2 receptors limit several detrimental effects resulting from binding of angiotensin II to AT1 receptors, which include vasoconstriction, enhanced inflammation and thrombosis.\n The increased generation of angiotensin1-7 also triggers counter-regulatory protective effects through binding to G-protein coupled Mas receptors.\n Unfortunately, the entry of SARS-CoV2 into the cells through membrane fusion markedly down-regulates ACE2 receptors, with loss of the catalytic effect of these receptors at the external site of the membrane.\n Increased pulmonary inflammation and coagulation have been reported as unwanted effects of enhanced and unopposed angiotensin II effects via the ACE?Angiotensin II?AT1 receptor axis.\n Clinical reports of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 show that several features associated with infection and severity of the disease (i.\ne.\n, older age, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease) share a variable degree of ACE2 deficiency.\n We suggest that ACE2 down-regulation induced by viral invasion may be especially detrimental in people with baseline ACE2 deficiency associated with the above conditions.\n The additional ACE2 deficiency after viral invasion might amplify the dysregulation between the ‘adverse’ ACE?Angiotensin II?AT1 receptor axis and the ‘protective’ ACE2?Angiotensin1-7?Mas receptor axis.\n In the lungs, such dysregulation would favor the progression of inflammatory and thrombotic processes triggered by local angiotensin II hyperactivity unopposed by angiotensin1-7.\n In this setting, recombinant ACE2, angiotensin1-7 and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers could be promising therapeutic approaches in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n","id":"PMC7167588","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"European Federation of Internal Medicine.

This includes patients with hypertension, heart disease, diabetes mellitus, and clearly the elderly.\n Many of those patients are treated with renin-angiotensin system blockers.\n Because the ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) protein is the receptor that facilitates coronavirus entry into cells, the notion has been popularized that treatment with renin-angiotensin system blockers might increase the risk of developing a severe and fatal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection.\n The present article discusses this concept.\n ACE2 in its full-length form is a membrane-bound enzyme, whereas its shorter (soluble) form circulates in blood at very low levels.\n As a mono-carboxypeptidase, ACE2 contributes to the degradation of several substrates including angiotensins I and II.\n ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors do not inhibit ACE2 because ACE and ACE2 are different enzymes.\n Although angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers have been shown to upregulate ACE2 in experimental animals, the evidence is not always consistent and differs among the diverse angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers and differing organs.\n Moreover, there are no data to support the notion that ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker administration facilitates coronavirus entry by increasing ACE2 expression in either animals or humans.\n Indeed, animal data support elevated ACE2 expression as conferring potential protective pulmonary and cardiovascular effects.\n In summary, based on the currently available evidence, treatment with renin-angiotensin system blockers should not be discontinued because of concerns with coronavirus infection.\n","id":"PMC7225046","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Lippincott, Williams &amp; Wilkins","authors":[{"firstname":"A.H.

A first step in understanding SARS pathogenesis","abstract":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an acute infectious disease that spreads mainly via the respiratory route.\n A distinct coronavirus (SARS?CoV) has been identified as the aetiological agent of SARS.\n Recently, a metallopeptidase named angiotensin?converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as the functional receptor for SARS?CoV.\n Although ACE2 mRNA is known to be present in virtually all organs, its protein expression is largely unknown.\n Since identifying the possible route of infection has major implications for understanding the pathogenesis and future treatment strategies for SARS, the present study investigated the localization of ACE2 protein in various human organs (oral and nasal mucosa, nasopharynx, lung, stomach, small intestine, colon, skin, lymph nodes, thymus, bone marrow, spleen, liver, kidney, and brain).\n The most remarkable finding was the surface expression of ACE2 protein on lung alveolar epithelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine.\n Furthermore, ACE2 was present in arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells in all organs studied.\n In conclusion, ACE2 is abundantly present in humans in the epithelia of the lung and small intestine, which might provide possible routes of entry for the SARS?CoV.\n This epithelial expression, together with the presence of ACE2 in vascular endothelium, also provides a first step in understanding the pathogenesis of the main SARS disease manifestations.\n Copyright © 2004 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.\n Published by John Wiley &amp;

severe cases resulted in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is a severe form of acute lung injury (ALI) that further contributes to morbidity.\n To date, no effective drugs that improve the clinical outcome of influenza A (H7N9) virus-infected patients have been identified.\n Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and ACE2 are involved in several pathologies such as cardiovascular functions, renal disease, and acute lung injury.\n In the current study, we report that ACE2 could mediate the severe acute lung injury induced by influenza A (H7N9) virus infection in an experimental mouse model.\n Moreover, ACE2 deficiency worsened the disease pathogenesis markedly, mainly by targeting the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1).\n The current findings demonstrate that ACE2 plays a critical role in influenza A (H7N9) virus-induced acute lung injury, and suggest that might be a useful potential therapeutic target for future influenza A (H7N9)

in heart failure and hypertensive heart disease.\n\n They may be similarly beneficial in patients with aortic stenosis (AS), but historical safety concerns have limited their use, and no prospective clinical trials exist.\n\n\nMethods and results\nWe conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 100 patients with moderate or severe asymptomatic AS to examine the physiological effects of ramipril, particularly LV mass (LVM) regression.\n\n Subjects were randomized to ramipril 10 mg daily (n = 50) or placebo (n = 50) for 1 year, and underwent cardiac magnetic resonance, echocardiography, and exercise testing at 0, 6, and 12 months, with follow-up data available in 77 patients.\n\n There was a modest but progressive reduction in LVM (the primary end point) in the ramipril group vs.\n\n the placebo group (mean change ?3.9 vs.\n\n +4.5 g, respectively, P = 0.0057).\n\n There were also trends towards improvements in myocardial physiology: the ramipril group showed preserved tissue Doppler systolic velocity compared with placebo (+0.0 vs.\n\n ?0.5 cm/s, P = 0.04), and a slower rate of progression of the AS (valve area 0.0 cm2 in the ramipril group vs.\n\n ?0.2 cm2 in the placebo arm, P = 0.067).\n\n There were no significant differences in major adverse cardiac events.\n\n\nConclusion\nACE inhibition leads to a modest, but progressive reduction in LVM in asymptomatic patients with moderate–severe AS compared with placebo, with trends towards improvements in myocardial physiology and slower progression of valvular stenosis.\n\n A larger clinical outcome trial to confirm these findings and explore their clinical relevance is required.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4505792","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Oxford University

outbreak in 2002 to 2003. Our decade-long structural studies on the receptor recognition by SARS-CoV have identified key interactions between SARS-CoV spike protein and its host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which regulate both the cross-species and human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV.\n One of the goals of SARS-CoV research was to build an atomic-level iterative framework of virus-receptor interactions to facilitate epidemic surveillance, predict species-specific receptor usage, and identify potential animal hosts and animal models of viruses.\n Based on the sequence of 2019-nCoV spike protein, we apply this predictive framework to provide novel insights into the receptor usage and likely host range of 2019-nCoV.\n This study provides a robust test of this reiterative framework,

By extracting and analyzing all available published clinical data, we identified several major clinical characteristics associated with increased disease severity and mortality among patients with COVID-19. Specifically, preexisting chronic conditions such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes are strongly associated with an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19; surprisingly, however, we found no correlation between chronic liver disease and increased disease severity.\n In addition, we found that both acute cardiac injury and acute kidney injury are highly correlated with an increased risk of COVID-19-related mortality.\n Given the high risk of comorbidity and the high mortality rate associated with tissue damage, organ function should be monitored closely in patients diagnosed with COVID-19, and this approach should be included when establishing new guidelines for managing these high-risk patients.\n Moreover, additional clinical data are needed in order to determine whether a supportive therapy can help mitigate the development of severe, potentially fatal complications, and further studies are needed to identify the pathophysiology and the mechanism underlying this novel coronavirus-associated infectious disease.\n Taken together, these findings provide new insights regarding clinical strategies for improving the management and outcome of patients with COVID-19.","id":"PMC7187729","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"AAAS","authors":[{"firstname":"Xinhui","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xuexian","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Xuexian","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhaoxian","surname":"Cai","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Zhaoxian","surname":"Cai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaotian","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiaotong","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Xiaotong","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Junxia","surname":"Min","email":"junxiamin@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Junxia","surname":"Min","email":"junxiamin@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fudi","surname":"Wang","email":"fwang@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Fudi","surname":"Wang","email":"fwang@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2002032","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China","abstract":"Background\nSince December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020.

2019 (Covid-19) has not been well studied.\n\n\nMethods\nWe carried out a population-based case–control study in the Lombardy region of Italy.\n\n A total of 6272 case patients in whom infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was confirmed between February 21 and March 11, 2020, were matched to 30,759 beneficiaries of the Regional Health Service (controls) according to sex, age, and municipality of residence.\n\n Information about the use of selected drugs and patients’ clinical profiles was obtained from regional databases of health care use.\n\n Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for associations between drugs and infection, with adjustment for confounders, were estimated by means of logistic regression.\n\n\nResults\nAmong both case patients and controls, the mean (±SD) age was 68±13 years, and 37% were women.\n\n The use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs was more common among case patients than among controls, as was the use of other antihypertensive and non-antihypertensive drugs, and case patients had a worse clinical profile.\n\n Use of ARBs or ACE inhibitors did not show any association with Covid-19 among case patients overall (adjusted odds ratio, 0.95 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.86 to 1.05] for ARBs and 0.96 [95% CI, 0.87 to 1.07] for ACE inhibitors) or among patients who had a severe or fatal course of the disease (adjusted odds ratio, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.63 to 1.10] for ARBs and 0.91 [95% CI, 0.69 to 1.21] for ACE inhibitors), and no association between these variables was found according to sex.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn this large, population-based study, the use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs was more frequent among patients with Covid-19 than among controls because of their higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease.\n\n However, there was no evidence that ACE inhibitors or ARBs affected the risk of

inhibitors might influence the severity of COVID-19. We aimed to evaluate whether continuing versus discontinuing renin–angiotensin system inhibitors (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers) affects outcomes in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19.\nMethods\nThe REPLACE COVID trial was a prospective, randomised, open-label trial done at 20 large referral hospitals in seven countries worldwide.\n\n Eligible participants were aged 18 years and older who were admitted to hospital with COVID-19 and were receiving a renin–angiotensin system inhibitor before admission.\n\n Individuals with contraindications to continuation or discontinuation of renin–angiotensin system inhibitor therapy were excluded.\n\n Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to continuation or discontinuation of their renin–angiotensin system inhibitor using permuted block randomisation, with allocation concealed using a secure web-based randomisation system.\n\n The primary outcome was a global rank score in which participants were ranked across four hierarchical tiers incorporating time to death, duration of mechanical ventilation, time on renal replacement or vasopressor therapy, and multiorgan dysfunction during the hospitalisation.\n\n Primary analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population.\n\n The REPLACE COVID trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.\n\ngov, NCT04338009.\n\n\nFindings\nBetween March 31 and Aug 20, 2020, 152 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to either continue or discontinue renin–angiotensin system inhibitor therapy (continuation group n=75; discontinuation group n=77).\n\n Mean age of participants was 62 years (SD 12), 68 (45%) were female, mean body-mass index was 33 kg/m2 (SD 8), and 79 (52%) had diabetes.\n\n Compared with discontinuation of renin–angiotensin system inhibitors, continuation had no effect on the global rank score (median rank 73 [IQR 40–110] for continuation vs 81 [38–117] for discontinuation; ?-coefficient 8 [95% CI ?13 to 29]).\n\n There were 16 (21%) of 75 participants in the continuation arm versus 14 (18%) of 77 in the discontinuation arm who required intensive care unit admission or invasive mechanical ventilation, and 11 (15%) of 75 participants in the continuation group versus ten (13%) of 77 in the discontinuation group died.\n\n 29 (39%) participants in the continuation group and 28 (36%) participants in the discontinuation group had at least one adverse event (?2 test of adverse events between treatment groups p=0·77).\n\n There was no difference in

angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) mitigates the course o\f recent-onset COVID-19.\nMethods\nACEI-COVID was a parallel group, randomised, controlled, open-label trial done at 35 centres in Austria and Germany.\n\n Patients aged 18 years and older were enrolled if they presented with recent symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and were chronically treated with ACEIs or ARBs.\n\n Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to discontinuation or continuation of RAS inhibition for 30 days.\n\n Primary outcome was the maximum sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score within 30 days, where death was scored with the maximum achievable SOFA score.\n\n Secondary endpoints were area under the death-adjusted SOFA score (AUCSOFA), mean SOFA score, admission to the intensive care unit,

We developed a machine learning classifier to identify “sick posts,” in which users report their own or other people’s symptoms and diagnoses related to COVID-19. Using officially reported case counts as the outcome, we then estimated the Granger causality of sick posts and other COVID-19 posts on daily case counts.\n\n For a subset of geotagged posts (3.10% of all retrieved posts), we also ran separate predictive models for Hubei province, the epicenter of the initial outbreak, and the rest of mainland China.\n\n\nResults\nWe found that reports of symptoms and diagnosis of COVID-19 significantly predicted daily case counts up to 14 days ahead of official statistics, whereas other COVID-19 posts did not have similar predictive power.\n\n For the subset of geotagged posts, we found that the predictive pattern held true for both Hubei province and the rest of mainland China regardless of the unequal distribution of health care resources and the outbreak timeline.\n\n\nConclusions\nPublic social media data can be usefully harnessed to predict infection cases and inform timely responses.\n\n Researchers and disease control agencies should pay close attention to the social media infosphere regarding COVID-19. In addition to monitoring overall search and posting activities, leveraging machine learning approaches and theoretical understanding of information sharing behaviors is a promising approach to identify true disease signals and improve the effectiveness of infoveillance.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7257484","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"JMIR Publications","authors":[{"firstname":"Gunther","surname":"Eysenbach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hai","surname":"Liang","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Hai","surname":"Liang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"King-wa","surname":"Fu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Eric","surname":"Lau","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Corey","surname":"Basch","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Cuihua","surname":"Shen","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Cuihua","surname":"Shen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Anfan","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Anfan","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chen","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Chen","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jingwen","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Jingwen","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Feng","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Feng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wang","surname":"Liao","email":"wngliao@ucdavis.edu","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Wang","surname":"Liao","email":"wngliao@ucdavis.edu","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) situation report - 165","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.3760/cma.j.issn.0254-6450.2020.02.003","date":"1970-01-01","title":"[The epidemiological characteristics of an outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) in China]","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.2196/18831","date":"2020-06-13","title":"Mapping of Health Literacy and Social Panic Via Web Search Data During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency: Infodemiological Study","abstract":"Background\nCoronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a type of pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus that was discovered in 2019. As of May 6, 2020, 84,407 cases and 4643 deaths have been confirmed in China.\n\n The Chinese population has expressed great concern since the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\n Meanwhile, an average of 1 billion people per day are using the Baidu search engine to find COVID-19–related health information.\n\n\nObjective\nThe aim of this paper is to analyze web search data volumes related to COVID-19 in China.\n\n\nMethods\nWe conducted an infodemiological study to analyze web search data volumes related to COVID-19. Using Baidu Index data, we assessed the search frequencies of specific search terms in Baidu to describe the impact of COVID-19 on public health, psychology, behaviors, lifestyles, and social policies (from February 11, 2020, to March 17, 2020).\n\n\nResults\nThe search frequency related to COVID-19 has increased significantly since February 11th.\n\n Our heat maps demonstrate that citizens in Wuhan, Hubei Province, express more concern about COVID-19 than citizens from other cities since the outbreak first occurred in Wuhan.\n\n Wuhan citizens frequently searched for content related to “medical help,” “protective materials,” and “pandemic progress.\n\n” Web searches for “return to work” and “go back to school” have increased eight-fold compared to the previous month.\n\n Searches for content related to “closed community and remote office” have continued to rise, and searches for “remote office demand” have risen by 663% from the previous quarter.\n\n Employees who have returned to work have mainly engaged in the following web searches: “return to work and prevention measures,” “return to work guarantee policy,” and “time to return to work.\n\n” Provinces with large, educated populations (eg, Henan, Hebei, and Shandong) have been focusing on “online education” whereas medium-sized cities have been paying more attention to “online medical care.\n\n”\nConclusions\nOur findings suggest that web search data may reflect changes in health literacy, social panic, and prevention and control policies in response to COVID-19.\n","id":"PMC7333795","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"JMIR Publications","authors":[{"firstname":"Gunther","surname":"Eysenbach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Michelle","surname":"Manning Hutson","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Michelle","surname":"Manning Hutson","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dinesh","surname":"Gunasekeran","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Olivia","surname":"Keiser","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chenjie","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Chenjie","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xinyu","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Xinyu","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yaogang","surname":"Wang","email":"wangyg@tmu.edu.cn","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Yaogang","surname":"Wang","email":"wangyg@tmu.edu.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1053/j.jrn.2020.03.006","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Impact of Nutrition and Diet on COVID-19 Infection and Implications for Kidney Health and Kidney Disease Management","abstract":"","id":"PMC7186539","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"by the National Kidney Foundation, Inc.","authors":[{"firstname":"Kamyar","surname":"Kalantar-Zadeh","email":"kkz@uci.edu","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Linda W.","surname":"Moore","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Linda W.","surname":"Moore","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1177/0141076820921107","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Protecting older people from COVID-19: should the United Kingdom\nstart at age 60?","abstract":"","id":"PMC7366331","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"SAGE Publications","authors":[{"firstname":"Tasnime","surname":"Osama","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Bharat","surname":"Pankhania","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Azeem","surname":"Majeed","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.2196/19636","date":"2020-06-15","title":"Identification of Symptoms Prognostic of COVID-19 Severity: Multivariate Data Analysis of a Case Series in Henan Province","abstract":"Background\nThe outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease (COVID-19), has been declared a global pandemic.\n\n Identifying individuals whose infection can potentially become severe is critical to control the case fatality rate of COVID-19. However, knowledge of symptoms that are prognostic of COVID-19 severity is lacking.\n\n\nObjective\nThe objective of our study was to identify symptoms prognostic of COVID-19 infection severity.\n\n\nMethods\nWe analyzed documented symptoms, including fever, cough, fatigue, expectoration, sore throat, chest distress, headache, diarrhea, rhinorrhea, stuffed nose, nausea, vomiting, muscle or joint ache, shortness of breath, and their associations with disease severity using a case series, including 655 confirmed cases from January 23 to February 5, 2020 in Henan Province, China.\n\n We also analyzed the influence of individual characteristics, including age, gender, and comorbidities, on symptoms with prognostic value.\n\n\nResults\nFatigue (95% CI 0.141 to 0.334, P&lt;.\n\n001), expectoration (95% CI 0.107 to 0.305, P&lt;.\n\n001) and stuffed nose (95% CI –0.499 to –0.082, P=.\n\n006) were identified as the prognostic symptoms of COVID-19 patients from the multivariate analysis.\n\n Fever occurred in 603/655 (92.1%) of the patients but was not associated with disease severity.\n\n Fatigue accounted for 184/655 (28.1%) of the patients and was linearly associated with infection severity with statistical significance.\n\n Expectoration occurred in 169/655 (25.8%) patients in the cohort and was the sole prognostic factor for patients with cardiovascular complications, including hypertension.\n\n Shortness of breath, chest distress, muscle or joint ache, and dry cough, which occurred in 33 (5%), 83 (12.7%), 78 (11.9%), and 276 (42.1%) of the 655 patients, respectively, were significantly enriched among patients classified as severe.\n\n Stuffed nose and nausea were associated with favorable disease severity, especially among male patients.\n\n More female than male patients were documented as having muscle or joint ache.\n\n Headache was most enriched in patents aged 15 to 39 years, followed by those aged 40 to 64 years, with statistical significance.\n\n\nConclusions\nFatigue and expectoration are signs of severe COVID-19 infection.\n\n Shortness of breath, chest distress, muscle or joint ache, and dry cough are prevalent in severe patients.\n\n Expectoration is commonly present in older individuals and patients with cardiovascular disorders, including hypertension.\n\n Shortness of breath is prognostic of severe infection in male patients.\n\n Stuffed nose and nausea are favorable prognostic factors of severe infection, especially among male patients.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7332230","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"JMIR

worldwide, contribute to the prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes, and could place these populations at an increased risk for severe COVID-19 pathology and mortality.\n WD consumption activates the innate immune system and impairs adaptive immunity, leading to chronic inflammation and impaired host defense against viruses.\n Furthermore, peripheral inflammation caused by COVID-19 may have long-term consequences in those that recover, leading to chronic medical conditions such as dementia and neurodegenerative disease, likely through neuroinflammatory mechanisms that can be compounded by an unhealthy diet.\n Thus, now more than ever, wider access to healthy foods should be a top priority and individuals should be mindful of healthy eating habits to reduce susceptibility to and

disease (COVID-19) has caused a pneumonia epidemic that began in Wuhan, China, and is rapidly spreading throughout the whole world.\n\n Italy is the hardest hit country after China.\n\n Considering the deleterious consequences of malnutrition, which certainly can affect patients with COVID-19, the aim of this article is to present a pragmatic protocol for early nutritional supplementation of non-critically ill patients hospitalized for COVID-19 disease.\n\n It is based on the observation that most patients present at admission with severe inflammation and anorexia leading to a drastic reduction of food intake, and that a substantial percentage develops respiratory failure requiring non-invasive ventilation or even continuous positive airway pressure.\n\n\nMethods\nHigh-calorie dense diets in a variety of different consistencies with highly digestible foods and snacks are available for all patients.\n\n Oral supplementation of whey proteins as well as intravenous infusion of multivitamin, multimineral trace elements solutions are implemented at admission.\n\n In the presence of 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficit, cholecalciferol is promptly supplied.\n\n If nutritional risk is detected, two to three bottles of protein-calorie oral nutritional supplements (ONS) are provided.\n\n If &lt;2 bottles/d of ONS are consumed for 2 consecutive days and/or respiratory conditions are worsening, supplemental/total parenteral nutrition is prescribed.\n\n\nConclusion\nWe are aware that our straight approach may be debatable.\n\n However, to cope with the current emergency crisis, its aim is to promptly and pragmatically implement nutritional care in patients with COVID-19, which might be overlooked despite being potentially beneficial to clinical outcomes and effective in preventing the consequences of malnutrition in this patient population.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7194616","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

for non-communicable diseases (NCDs); however, its impact on the burden of NCDs has not been systematically evaluated.\n\n This study aimed to evaluate the consumption of major foods and nutrients across 195 countries and to quantify the impact of their suboptimal intake on NCD mortality and morbidity.\n\n\nMethods\nBy use of a comparative risk assessment approach, we estimated the proportion of disease-specific burden attributable to each dietary risk factor (also referred to as population attributable fraction) among adults aged 25 years or older.\n\n The main inputs to this analysis included the intake of each dietary factor, the effect size of the dietary factor on disease endpoint, and the level of intake associated with the lowest risk of mortality.\n\n Then, by use of disease-specific population attributable fractions, mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), we calculated the number of deaths and DALYs attributable to diet for each disease outcome.\n\n\nFindings\nIn 2017, 11 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 10–12) deaths and 255 million (234–274) DALYs were attributable to dietary risk factors.\n\n High intake of sodium (3 million [1–5] deaths and 70 million [34–118] DALYs), low intake of whole grains (3 million [2–4] deaths and 82 million [59–109] DALYs), and low intake of fruits (2 million [1–4] deaths and 65 million [41–92] DALYs) were the leading dietary risk factors for deaths and DALYs globally and in many countries.\n\n Dietary data were from mixed sources and were not available for all countries, increasing the statistical uncertainty of our estimates.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThis study provides a comprehensive picture of the potential impact of suboptimal diet on NCD mortality and morbidity, highlighting the need for improving diet across nations.\n\n Our findings will inform implementation of evidence-based dietary interventions and provide a platform for evaluation of their impact on human health

vaccine should be immunized for uninfected people and health care workers.\n In addition, convalescent plasma should be given to COVID?19 patients if it is available.\n In conclusion, we suggest that all the potential interventions be implemented to control the emerging COVID?19 if the infection is uncontrollable.\n","id":"PMC7166986","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley and

a selected chronic disease, and the relationships between modifiable lifestyle risk factors and age to first of six chronic diseases.\n\n\nMethods\nOntario respondents from 2001 to 2010 of the Canadian Community Health Survey were followed up with administrative data until 2014 for congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive respiratory disease, diabetes, lung cancer, myocardial infarction and stroke.\n\n By sex, the cumulative incidence function of age to first chronic disease was calculated for the six chronic diseases individually and compositely.\n\n The associations between modifiable lifestyle risk factors (alcohol, body mass index, smoking, diet, physical inactivity) and age to first chronic disease were estimated using cause-specific Cox proportional hazards models and Fine-Gray competing risk models.\n\n\nResults\nDiabetes was the most common disease.\n\n By age 70.5?years (2015 world life expectancy), 50.9% of females and 58.1% of males had at least one disease and few had a death free of the selected diseases (3.4% females; 5.4% males).\n\n Of the lifestyle factors, heavy smoking had the strongest association with the risk of experiencing at least one chronic disease (cause-specific hazard ratio?=?3.86; 95% confidence interval?=?3.46, 4.31).\n\n The lifestyle factors were modelled for each disease separately, and the associations varied by chronic disease and sex.\n\n\nConclusions\nWe found that most individuals will have at least one of the six chronic diseases before dying.\n\n This study provides a novel approach using competing risk methods to examine the incidence of chronic diseases relative to the life course and how their incidences are associated with lifestyle

characterized COVID-19 patients at the time at which they were diagnosed in outpatient settings and estimated 30-day hospital admission and fatality rates.\n\n\nMethods\nThis was a population-based cohort study.\n\n\n?\nData were obtained from Information System for Research in Primary Care (SIDIAP)—a primary-care records database covering &gt;6 million people (&gt;80% of the population of Catalonia), linked to COVID-19 reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests and hospital emergency, inpatient and mortality registers.\n\n We included all patients in the database who were ?15?years old and diagnosed with COVID-19 in outpatient settings between 15 March and 24 April 2020 (10 April for outcome studies).\n\n Baseline characteristics included socio-demographics,

(interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and

(ii) the supply of energy to infectious bacteria; (iii) the inflammatory response; and (iv) oxidative stress as a result of bacterial proliferative metabolism.\n Consistent with this evidence, some bacterial infections are typical (and/or have a worse prognosis) in patients with hypercaloric diets and a stressful lifestyle (conditions that promote hyperglycemic episodes).\n On this basis, the present review is particularly focused on: (i) the role of diabetes in the development of some bacterial and viral infections by analyzing preclinical and clinical findings;

Many factors have been associated with both altered ACE2 expression and COVID?19 severity and progression, including age, sex, ethnicity, medication, and several co?morbidities, such as cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome.\n Although ACE2 is widely distributed in various human tissues and many of its determinants have been well recognised, ACE2?expressing organs do not equally participate in COVID?19 pathophysiology, implying that other mechanisms are involved in orchestrating cellular infection resulting in tissue damage.\n Reports of pathologic findings in tissue specimens of COVID?19 patients are rapidly emerging and confirm the established role of ACE2 expression and activity in disease pathogenesis.\n Identifying pathologic changes caused by SARS?CoV?2 infection is crucially important as it has major implications for understanding COVID?19 pathophysiology and the development of evidence?based treatment strategies.\n Currently, many interventional strategies are being explored in ongoing clinical trials, encompassing many drug classes and strategies, including antiviral drugs, biological response modifiers, and RAAS inhibitors.\n Ultimately, prevention is key to combat COVID?19 and appropriate measures are being taken accordingly, including development of effective vaccines.\n In this review, we describe the role of ACE2 in COVID?19 pathophysiology, including factors influencing ACE2 expression and activity in relation to COVID?19 severity.\n In addition, we discuss the relevant pathological changes resulting from SARS?CoV?2 infection.\n Finally, we highlight a selection of potential treatment modalities for COVID?19. © 2020 The Authors.\n The Journal of Pathology published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd on behalf of Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.\n","id":"PMC7276767","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd","authors":[{"firstname":"Arno R","surname":"Bourgonje","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Amaal E","surname":"Abdulle","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Amaal E","surname":"Abdulle","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wim","surname":"Timens","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jan?Luuk","surname":"Hillebrands","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Jan?Luuk","surname":"Hillebrands","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gerjan J","surname":"Navis","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sanne J","surname":"Gordijn","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Marieke C","surname":"Bolling","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Marieke C","surname":"Bolling","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gerard","surname":"Dijkstra","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Adriaan A","surname":"Voors","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Albert DME","surname":"Osterhaus","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peter HJ","surname":"van der Voort","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Douwe J","surname":"Mulder","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Harry","surname":"van Goor","email":"h.van.goor@umcg.nl","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.orcp.2020.05.009","date":"2020-05-29","title":"Obesity prolongs the hospital stay in patients affected by COVID-19, and may impact on SARS-COV-2 shedding","abstract":"\n\n\n•\nSubjects with obesity affected by COVID-19 require longer hospitalization compared to subjects without obesity.\n","id":"PMC7269944","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Asia Oceania Association for the Study of Obesity.

The clear common thread among the top risk groups—vitamin D deficiency—may be being overlooked because of previous overstated claims of vitamin D benefits.\n However, the need to decrease COVID-19 fatalities among high-risk populations is urgent.\n Early researchers reported three striking patterns.\n Firstly, the innate immune system is impaired by vitamin D deficiency, which would predispose sufferers to viral infections such as COVID-19. Vitamin D deficiency also increases the activity of the X-chromosome-linked “Renin-Angiotensin” System, making vitamin D deficient individuals (especially men) more susceptible to COVID-19's deadly “cytokine storm” (dramatic immune system overreaction).\n Secondly, the groups who are at highest risk for severe COVID-19 match those who are at highest risk for severe vitamin D deficiency.\n This includes the elderly, men, ethnic groups whose skin is naturally rich in melanin (if living outside the tropics), those who avoid sun exposure for cultural and health reasons, those who live in institutions, the obese, and/or those who suffer with hypertension, cardiovascular disease, or diabetes.\n And thirdly, the pattern of geographical spread of COVID-19 reflects higher population vitamin D deficiency.\n Both within the USA and throughout the world, COVID-19 fatality rates parallel vitamin D deficiency rates.\n A literature search was performed on PubMed, Google Scholar, and RSMLDS, with targeted Google searches providing additional sources.\n Although randomized controlled trial results may be available eventually, the correlational and causal study evidence supporting a link between vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 risks is already so strong that it supports action.\n The 141 author groups writing primarily about biological plausibility detailed how vitamin D deficiency can explain every risk factor and every complication of COVID-19, but agreed that other factors are undoubtedly at work.\n COVID-19 was compared with dengue fever, for which oral vitamin D supplements of 4,000 IU for 10 days were significantly more effective than 1,000 IU in reducing virus replication and controlling the “cytokine storm” (dramatic immune system over-reaction) responsible for fatalities.\n Among the 47 original research studies summarized here, chart reviews found that serum vitamin D levels predicted COVID-19 mortality rates (16 studies) and linearly predicted COVID-19 illness severity (8 studies).\n Two causal modeling studies and several analyses of variance strongly supported the hypothesis that vitamin D deficiency is a causal, rather than a bystander, factor in COVID-19 outcomes.\n Three of the four studies whose findings opposed the hypothesis relied upon disproven assumptions.\n The literature review also found that prophylactically correcting possible vitamin D deficiency during the COVID-19 pandemic is extremely safe.\n Widely recommending 2,000 IU of vitamin D daily for all populations with limited ability to manufacture vitamin D from the sun has virtually no potential for harm and is reasonably likely to save many lives.\n","id":"PMC7513835","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Frontiers Media S.A.","authors":[{"firstname":"Linda L.","surname":"Benskin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.ajic.2020.06.193","date":"1970-01-01","title":"COVID-19 fatalities, latitude, sunlight, and vitamin D","abstract":"Background\nSince Vitamin D is known to be vital in regulating the immune system, and sunlight UV radiation exposure on the skin produces Vitamin D and UV intensity is highest nearest the equator, a study was done to examine the correlation between the latitude and COVID-19 fatality rates for countries.\n\n\nMethods\nEighty-eight countries were selected based on their likelihood of providing reliable data.\n\n Using death rates/million for each country from the “worldometer” website, a correlation analysis was done between death rates and a country's latitude.\n\n\nResults\nA highly significant, positive correlation was found between lower death rates and a country's proximity to the equator (Pearson r?=?0.40 P &lt; .\n\n0001, 2-tailed t test).\n\n The R squared of 0.16 means that 16% of the variation in death rates among nations is accounted for by the latitude of the country.\n\n Evidence is presented suggesting a direct correlation between sunlight exposure and reduced mortality.\n\n\nDiscussion\nThis study is the first to document a statistically significant correlation between a country's latitude and its COVID-19 mortality and is consistent with other research regarding latitude, Vitamin D deficiency, and COVID-19 fatalities.\n\n Limitations of this study are noted.\n\n\nConclusions\nFurther research is needed to confirm the correlation between latitude and COVID-19 fatalities, and to determine the optimum amounts of safe sunlight exposure and/or vitamin D oral supplementation to reduce COVID-19 fatalities in populations that are at high risk for vitamin D deficiency.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7319635","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc.

The aim of this meeting was to address ongoing controversies and timely topics in vitamin D research, to review available data related to these topics and controversies, to promote discussion to help resolve lingering issues and ultimately to suggest a research agenda to clarify areas of uncertainty.\n Several issues from the first conference, held in 2017, were revisited, such as assays used to determine serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration, which remains a critical and controversial issue for defining vitamin D status.\n Definitions of vitamin D nutritional status (i.\ne.\n sufficiency, insufficiency and deficiency) were also revisited.\n New areas were reviewed, including vitamin D threshold values and how they should be defined in the context of specific diseases, sources of vitamin D and risk factors associated with vitamin D deficiency.\n Non-skeletal aspects related to vitamin D were also discussed, including the reproductive system, neurology, chronic kidney disease and falls.\n The therapeutic role of vitamin D and findings from recent clinical trials were also addressed.\n The topics were considered by 3 focus groups and divided into three main areas: 1) “Laboratory”: assays and threshold values to define vitamin D status; 2) “Clinical”: sources of vitamin D and risk factors and role of vitamin D in non-skeletal disease and 3) “Therapeutics”: controversial issues on observational studies and recent randomized controlled trials.\n In this report, we present a summary of our findings.\n","id":"PMC7113202","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Springer US","authors":[{"firstname":"A.","surname":"Giustina","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"R.

25-hydroxyvitamin D and other metabolites, including 1,25(OH)2D, the ligand for the vitamin D receptor (VDR).\n The effects of the vitamin D endocrine system on bone and its growth plate are primarily indirect and mediated by its effect on intestinal calcium transport and serum calcium and phosphate homeostasis.\n Rickets and osteomalacia can be prevented by daily supplements of 400 IU of vitamin D.\n Vitamin D deficiency (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D &lt;50 nmol/L) accelerates bone turnover, bone loss, and osteoporotic fractures.\n These risks can be reduced by 800 IU of vitamin D together with an appropriate calcium intake, given to institutionalized or vitamin D–deficient elderly subjects.\n VDR and vitamin D metabolic enzymes are widely expressed.\n Numerous genetic, molecular, cellular, and animal studies strongly suggest that vitamin D signaling has many extraskeletal effects.\n These include regulation of cell proliferation, immune and muscle function, skin differentiation, and reproduction, as well as vascular and metabolic properties.\n From observational studies in human subjects, poor vitamin D status is associated with nearly all diseases predicted by these extraskeletal actions.\n Results of randomized controlled trials and Mendelian randomization studies are supportive of vitamin D supplementation in reducing the incidence of some diseases, but, globally, conclusions are mixed.\n These findings point to a need for continued ongoing and future basic and clinical studies to better define whether vitamin D status can be optimized to improve many aspects of human health.\n Vitamin D deficiency enhances the risk of osteoporotic fractures and is associated with many diseases.\n We review what is established and what is plausible regarding the

the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing Municipal Science and Technology

Approximately 41% of the June sample wore a mask.\n At that time, the odds of an individual wearing a mask increased significantly with age and was also 1.5x greater for females than males.\n Additionally, the odds of observing a mask on an urban or suburban shopper were ~4x that for rural areas.\n Mask mandates enacted in late July and August increased mask-wearing compliance to over 90% in all groups, but a small percentage of resistors remained.\n Thus, gender, age, and location factor into whether shoppers in the United States wear a mask or face covering voluntarily.\n Additionally, mask mandates are necessary to increase mask wearing among the public to a level required to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.","id":"PMC7561164","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of Science","authors":[{"firstname":"Michael H.","surname":"Haischer","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rachel","surname":"Beilfuss","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Rachel","surname":"Beilfuss","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Meggie Rose","surname":"Hart","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lauren","surname":"Opielinski","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"David","surname":"Wrucke","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gretchen","surname":"Zirgaitis","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Toni D.","surname":"Uhrich","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sandra K.","surname":"Hunter","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yuka","surname":"Kotozaki","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Yuka","surname":"Kotozaki","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuka","surname":"Kotozaki","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31561-0","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Sex and gender: modifiers of health, disease, and medicine","abstract":"Clinicians can encounter sex and gender disparities in diagnostic and therapeutic responses.\n These disparities are noted in epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, disease progression, and response to treatment.\n This Review discusses the fundamental influences of sex and gender as modifiers of the major causes of death and morbidity.\n We articulate how the genetic, epigenetic, and hormonal influences of biological sex influence physiology and disease, and how the social constructs of gender affect the behaviour of the community, clinicians, and patients in the health-care system and interact with pathobiology.\n We aim to guide clinicians and researchers to consider sex and gender in their approach to diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of diseases as a necessary and fundamental step towards precision medicine, which will benefit men's and women's health.\n","id":"PMC7440877","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Franck","surname":"Mauvais-Jarvis","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Noel","surname":"Bairey Merz","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Peter J","surname":"Barnes","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Roberta D","surname":"Brinton","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Juan-Jesus","surname":"Carrero","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Dawn L","surname":"DeMeo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Geert J","surname":"De Vries","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"C Neill","surname":"Epperson","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ramaswamy","surname":"Govindan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sabra L","surname":"Klein","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Amedeo","surname":"Lonardo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pauline M","surname":"Maki","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Louise D","surname":"McCullough","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Vera","surname":"Regitz-Zagrosek","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Judith G","surname":"Regensteiner","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Joshua B","surname":"Rubin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kathryn","surname":"Sandberg","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ayako","surname":"Suzuki","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"P.

Inhibition of TMPRSS2 may work to block or decrease the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infections.\n\n Intriguingly, TMPRSS2 is an androgen-regulated gene that is up-regulated in prostate cancer where it supports tumor progression and is involved in a frequent genetic translocation with the ERG gene.\n\n First- or second-generation androgen-deprivation therapies (ADTs) decrease the levels of TMPRSS2. Here we put forward the hypothesis that ADTs may protect patients affected by prostate cancer from SARS-CoV-2 infections.\n\n\nMaterials and methods\nWe extracted data regarding 9280 patients (4532 males) with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from 68 hospitals in Veneto, one of the Italian regions that was most affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.\n\n The parameters used for each COVID-19-positive patient were sex, hospitalization, admission to intensive care unit, death, tumor diagnosis, prostate cancer diagnosis, and ADT.\n\n\nResults\nThere were evaluable 9280 SARS-CoV-2-positive patients in Veneto on 1 April 2020.

Since previous reports suggested that viral entry into cells may involve angiotensin converting enzyme 2, there has been growing concern that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) use may exacerbate the disease severity. In this retrospective, single-center US study of adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19, we evaluated the association of ACEI/ARB use with hospital admission. Secondary outcomes included: ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, length of hospital stay, use of inotropes, and all-cause mortality. Propensity score matching was performed to account for potential confounders. Among 590 unmatched patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 78 patients were receiving ACEI/ARB (median age 63 years and 59.7% male) and 512 patients were non-users (median age 42 years and 47.1% male). In the propensity matched population, multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusting for age, gender and comorbidities demonstrated that ACEI/ARB use was not associated with hospital admission (OR 1.2, 95%CI 0.5 to 2.7, p = 0.652). CAD and CKD/end stage renal disease [ESRD] remained independently associated with admission to hospital. All-cause mortality, ICU stay, need for ventilation, and inotrope use was not significantly different between the 2 study groups. In conclusion, among patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19, ACEI/ARB use was not associated with increased risk of hospital admission.\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral pandemic precipitated by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerging in late December 2019 from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. Since then, the number of cases has exponentially increased around the globe, with over 9 million confirmed cases as of June 27, 2020. Early in the pandemic, it was postulated that the use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAS) antagonists may independently affect health outcomes in patients with COVID-19. This hypothesis originates from the intricate interplay between the SARS-CoV-2 and RAS system; membrane bound angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been suggested to play an important role for SARS-CoV-2 entry into human cells. However, direct evidence for infection of cardiac tissue by SARS-CoV-2 and expression levels of ACE2 in different cardiac cell types remain unknown. Furthermore, patients with comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) have higher circulating ACE2 expression, leading to a potentially additive effect with ACEI/ARB use. Yet some experts contend that ACEIs/ARBs may be beneficial in these patients :the main substrate of ACE2 is angiotensin II, converting it to angiotensin 1-7 which causes vasodilation and hypotension. There remains a lack of clinical data regarding association of ACEI/ARB use and outcomes in humans infected with SARS-CoV-2.\nGiven its prevalent usage in the United States coupled with the growing concern that ACEI/ARB use may exacerbate viral disease, there is an urgent need to address the inquiry about continuing ACEI/ARB in patients diagnosed with COVID-19. In the current report, we present a retrospective cohort study evaluating the association of ACEI/ARB use with hospital admission in patients with COVID-19 in the United States.\nMethods\nThis is a retrospective cohort study of all consecutive adult patients (&gt;=18 years) who presented to the outpatient, emergency room, or inpatient setting and were diagnosed with COVID-19 between March 1st, 2020 and April 15th, 2020 at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Health System. The UCLA Health Care System includes 2 academic medical centers (UCLA Ronald Reagan and UCLA Santa Monica) and multiple ambulatory outpatient sites dispersed throughout Los Angeles County. COVID-19 was diagnosed based on a positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction of a nasopharyngeal swab or a bronchoalveolar lavage. This study was exempt from patient informed consent under oversight by the institutional review board of the University of California, Los Angeles.\nData including patient demographics, clinical presentation, laboratory values, past medical history, and outpatient medications were collected from the electronic medical record. Patient demographic information included age, gender, race, and body mass index. The patient's clinical presentation included symptoms (subjective fevers, chills, night sweats, cough, sore throat, congestion, dyspnea, chest pain, myalgia, malaise, headaches, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, loss of smell/taste, decrease appetite, dizziness, syncope, altered mental status), approximate start of symptoms onset and COVID-19 testing date were collected. Comorbidities of interest included history of cardiovascular disease and associated risk-factors (hypertension, diabetes, obesity, prior/present smoking, coronary artery disease [CAD], myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass grafting, cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure [CHF], valvular disease, valvular intervention, atrial fibrillation and other arrhythmias including cardiac arrest, heart block, and cardiac device implantation, cerebrovascular accident [CVA], peripheral artery disease), hypothyroidism, reactive airway disease, chronic lung disease, sleep apnea, CKD and ESRD, organ transplant, deep venous or pulmonary thromboembolism, liver disease, malignancy, gastrointestinal bleeding, inflammatory bowel disease, hematologic disorders, rheumatologic disorders, prior surgeries, and depression, which were abstracted from the electronic medical record. Use of outpatient medications, specifically cardiovascular medications which included ACEIs, ARBs, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, diuretics, statins, anti-platelet therapy, diabetic and immunosuppressive medications were collected from electronic medical records. For those patients that were hospitalized serial cardiovascular (troponin and brain natriuretic peptide) and inflammatory markers (D-Dimer, erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], C-reactive protein [CRP], and Interleukin-6, procalcitonin) were abstracted from electronic medical records.\nA patient's first interaction with a healthcare system to discuss COVID-19 symptoms and testing via phone call, telemedicine visit, outpatient clinic visit, or emergency room visit was defined as the index healthcare COVID-19 contact. Patients who were on an ACEI/ARB at the time of their index healthcare COVID-19 contact were classified as ACEI/ARB group. Those patients who were not on an ACEI/ARB at the time of their index healthcare COVID-19 contact were defined as the non-ACEI/ARB group. Patients in whom ACEI/ARB was discontinued after hospitalization they were included in the ACEI/ARB group for the primary outcome analysis. CVA was defined as a prior stroke or transient ischemic attack. Chronic lung disease was defined as a diagnosis of asthma, chronic obstructive lung disease, bronchitis or emphysema. CKD was defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate of &lt;60 and ESRD disease was defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate of &lt;15 or treatment with dialysis.\nThe primary outcome was inpatient admission. Emergency room visit with subsequent discharge was not considered inpatient admission. Secondary outcomes included: need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission, need for endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, length of hospital stay, all-cause mortality and cardiac and inflammatory biomarkers.\nGiven significant differences in age and other comorbidities between the 2 study groups propensity score-matched cohorts were created to adjust for expected confounders associated with increased likelihood of ACEI/ARB use. Propensity scores derived from logistic regression were used to match ACEI/ARB and non-ACEI/ARB using a matching caliper size of 0.2. Variables used for matching included: age, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes/pre-diabetes, CAD, CHF, CVA, chronic lung disease, and CKD/ESRD. Sensitivity analysis was performed to test the robustness of model by evaluating different combination of confounding variables in the propensity regression model. Of note, propensity matching without hypertension as a covariate resulted in significant imbalance for other cardiovascular comorbidities, therefore it was included in the model as a covariate. Matching was considered robust and successful if no significant difference was observed between the 2 study groups for the covariate using non-parametric testing. Any imbalanced and clinically important variables were further adjusted in the logistic regression model.\nContinuous variables were expressed as median and interquartile range (IQR), and categorical variables were expressed as number and percentage (%). Statistical differences between the 2 groups were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables, while categorical variables were compared using Fisher's exact test for both unmatched and matched cohorts. The risk for the primary outcome and corresponding odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using binary logistic regression models comparing the ACEI/ARB group versus the non-ACEI/ARB group in both unmatched and matched cohorts after adjusting for significant comorbidities. Covariates in the model included gender in addition to variables used in propensity matching, age was categorized into 10-year increments in regression model. Area under curve (AUC) was calculated using receiver operating curves (ROC) to evaluate predictive value of age and number of comorbidities. A 2-side p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Significant factors independently associated with admission to hospital in this matched model included: CAD (OR 4.1, 95%CI 1.2 to 13.2, p = 0.022) and CKD/ESRD (OR 5.6, 95%CI 1.8 to 17.2, p = 0.002) (Table 6).\nDiscussion\nIn this single-center, retrospective, US based cohort study of 590 consecutive patients with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, baseline use of ACEI/ARB was not associated with increased risk of hospital admission. Two recently published studies from China evaluated the association of ACEI/ARB with all-cause in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19.   Our study evaluated the impact of outpatient ACEI/ARB use on outcomes in patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Our study adds to the growing COVID-19 literature, and further strengthens the recommendations put forth by professional societies, including American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association, and Heart Failure Society of America to continue ACEI/ARBs among patients with co-existing hypertension and COVID-19.\nHypertension and use of ACEI/ARB is more common in patients who are older and have other major CV comorbidities including CAD, MI, CHF, CVA and CKD, therefore, these key confounders must be accounted for in the studies evaluating role of ACEI/ARB on outcomes.   In our study, we found that ACEI/ARB users had more comorbidities than non-ACEI/ARB users. This relationship of increased number of comorbidities with ACEI/ARB use was also seen when stratified by primary outcome of in-hospital admission (Figure 1). After our study was propensity matched for known covariates of poor outcomes in COVID-19,   we found no differences in the rate of hospital admissions in ACEI/ARB users versus nonusers. There were also no differences between groups in secondary outcomes, focusing on clinical markers of inpatient prognosis, such as ICU admission, length of hospital stay, mechanical ventilation, inotrope use and all-cause mortality. However; we did find that CAD and CKD/ESRD remained significant independent determinants of admission to hospital in the multivariate analysis.\nInterestingly, after propensity matching, median peak inflammatory markers, including ESR, CRP, Interleukin-6, and D-dimer laboratory values were higher in the non-ACEI/ARB group. This finding is consistent with recently published data by Zhang et al. These results may partially be explained by the intricate interaction of ACEI/ARB with the RAS system. ACEI/ARB upregulates membrane-bound ACE2, which in turn converts angiotensin II to angiotensin-(1 to 7), attenuating the vasoconstrictive and inflammatory effects of angiotensin II. Studies investigating ACEI/ARB use have shown an association with reduction of various inflammatory markers including fibrinogen, D-dimer and CRP. Therefore, ACEI/ARB use during COVID-19 infection may potentially lead to lower levels although in our study they did not translate into improved clinical outcomes.\nOur study adds to the growing body of evidence that in patients with COVID-19 there is no adverse association of ACEI/ARB use with clinical outcomes.   Zhang et al showed a decreased mortality in patients on ACEI/ARB, while the study by Li et al showed no significant difference in mortality in patients with and without ACE or ARB use. The theoretical concerns of ACEI/ARB facilitating SARS-CoV-2 entry into human cells by way of increased ACE2 expression, have not been confirmed in any clinical studies. While future prospective and randomized-controlled trials are needed, this study demonstrates that continuation of ACEI/ARB therapy appears to be safe and warranted. This could be due to downregulation of ACE2 in cardiac tissue as suggested by Nicin et al or due to genetic variance and polymorphism of ACE2 in humans. Additionally, discontinuing ACEI/ARB therapy has potential downstream effects such as clinical deterioration in patients with CHF, myocardial infarction and rebound hypertension.\nThis study has several limitations. First, this cohort was obtained from a single University Health System. While the study does encompass a heterogeneous population, further geographically and racially diverse studies to provide greater generalizability. Second, our sample size was modest, but the findings of our study are consistent with those from other studies evaluating inpatients with COVID-19 and include data verified by physician review. The study sample is not large enough to evaluate differential effects between ACEI/ARBs, varying indications for these medications, such as heart failure with reduced ejection fraction or hypertension or the role of race. Finally, the study was a retrospective analysis and thus prone to inherit biases such as unmeasured confounding between the 2 study groups. Although, we performed propensity matching to account for these disparities, further large-scale prospective and randomized controlled are needed to better understand the efficacy of ACEI/ARB use in patients with COVID-19.\nAmong patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19, ACEI/ARB use was not associated with increased risk of hospital admission. Cardiovascular comorbidities are major determinants of admission to hospital in patients with COVID-19. While future prospective and randomized-controlled trials are needed, this study adds to a growing body of evidence that continuation of ACEI/ARB therapy, appears to be safe and further supports current societal recommendations by American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/and Heart Failure Society of America to continue ACEI/ARB therapy in a heterogenous COVID-19 patient population.\nAuthors' Contribution\nDavid Bae: Conceptualization, Methodology, Investigation, Data Curation, Writing - Original draft preparation, Visualization.

Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China5.\n This outbreak highlights the ongoing ability of viral spill-over from animals to cause severe disease in humans.\n","id":"PMC7094943","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing Group UK","authors":[{"firstname":"Fan","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Su","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yan-Mei","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wen","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhi-Gang","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Wu","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Wu","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jun-Hua","surname":"Tian","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan-Yuan","surname":"Pei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ming-Li","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yu-Ling","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fa-Hui","surname":"Dai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi-Min","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiao-Jiao","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Edward C.","surname":"Holmes","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong-Zhen","surname":"Zhang","email":"zhangyongzhen@shphc.org.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong-Zhen","surname":"Zhang","email":"zhangyongzhen@shphc.org.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.micinf.2020.01.003","date":"2020-01-24","title":"Measures for diagnosing and treating infections by a novel coronavirus responsible for a pneumonia outbreak originating in Wuhan, China","abstract":"On 10 January 2020, a new coronavirus causing a pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan City in central China was denoted as 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization (WHO).\n As of 24 January 2020, there were 887 confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV infection, including 26 deaths, reported in China and other countries.\n Therefore, combating this new virus and stopping the epidemic is a matter of urgency.\n Here, we focus on advances in research and development of fast diagnosis methods, as well as potential prophylactics and therapeutics to prevent or treat 2019-nCoV infection.\n","id":"PMC7102556","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Institut Pasteur.

P?&lt;?.\n01) was negatively correlated with the CT severity scores.\n The receiver?operating characteristic analysis demonstrated that area under the curve of CRP on the first visit for predicting severe COVID?19 was 0.87 (95% CI 0.10–1.00) at 20.42 mg/L cut?off, with sensitivity and specificity 83% and 91%, respectively.\n CRP in severe COVID?19 patients increased significantly at the initial stage, before CT findings.\n Importantly, CRP, which was associated with disease development, predicted early severe COVID?19.","id":"PMC7262341","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley and Sons Inc.","authors":[{"firstname":"Chaochao","surname":"Tan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fengxia","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kui","surname":"Tan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qionghui","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xixin","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaosong","surname":"Li","email":"lxsong0308@163.com","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.eclinm.2020.100375","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Eosinopenia and elevated C-reactive protein facilitate triage of COVID-19 patients in fever clinic: A retrospective case-control study","abstract":"Background\nCoronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently a pandemic affecting over 200 countries.\n\n Many cities have established designated fever clinics to triage suspected COVID-19 patients from other patients with similar symptoms.\n\n However, given the limited availability of the nucleic acid test as well as long waiting time for both the test and radiographic examination, the quarantine or therapeutic decisions for a large number of mixed patients were often not made in time.\n\n We aimed to identify simple and quickly available laboratory biomarkers to facilitate effective triage at the fever clinics for sorting suspected COVID-19 patients from those with COVID-19-like symptoms.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected clinical, etiological, and laboratory data of 989 patients who visited the Fever Clinic at Wuhan Union Hospital, Wuhan, China, from Jan 31 to Feb 21. Based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) nucleic acid testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection, they were divided into two groups: SARS-CoV-2-positive patients as cases and SARS-CoV-2-negative patients as controls.\n\n We compared the clinical features and laboratory findings of the two groups, and analyzed the diagnostic performance of several laboratory parameters in predicting SARS-CoV-2 infection and made relevant comparisons to the China diagnosis guideline of having a normal or decreased number of leukocytes (?9·5 109/L) or lymphopenia (&lt;1·1 109/L).\n\n\nFindings\nNormal or decreased number of leukocytes (?9·5 109/L), lymphopenia (&lt;1·1 109/L), eosinopenia (&lt;0·02 109/L), and elevated hs-CRP (?4 mg/L) were presented in 95·0%, 52·2%, 74·7% and 86·7% of COVID-19 patients, much higher than 87·2%, 28·8%, 31·3% and 45·2% of the controls, respectively.\n\n The eosinopenia produced a sensitivity of 74·7% and specificity of 68·7% for separating the two groups with the area under the curve (AUC) of 0·717.

By extracting and analyzing all available published clinical data, we identified several major clinical characteristics associated with increased disease severity and mortality among patients with COVID-19. Specifically, preexisting chronic conditions such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes are strongly associated with an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19; surprisingly, however, we found no correlation between chronic liver disease and increased disease severity.\n In addition, we found that both acute cardiac injury and acute kidney injury are highly correlated with an increased risk of COVID-19-related mortality.\n Given the high risk of comorbidity and the high mortality rate associated with tissue damage, organ function should be monitored closely in patients diagnosed with COVID-19, and this approach should be included when establishing new guidelines for managing these high-risk patients.\n Moreover, additional clinical data are needed in order to determine whether a supportive therapy can help mitigate the development of severe, potentially fatal complications, and further studies are needed to identify the pathophysiology and the mechanism underlying this novel coronavirus-associated infectious disease.\n Taken together, these findings provide new insights regarding clinical strategies for improving the management and outcome of patients with COVID-19.","id":"PMC7187729","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"AAAS","authors":[{"firstname":"Xinhui","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuexian","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuexian","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhaoxian","surname":"Cai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhaoxian","surname":"Cai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaotian","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaotong","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaotong","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Junxia","surname":"Min","email":"junxiamin@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Junxia","surname":"Min","email":"junxiamin@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fudi","surname":"Wang","email":"fwang@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fudi","surname":"Wang","email":"fwang@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2002032","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China","abstract":"Background\nSince December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the

2019 (Covid-19) has not been well studied.\n\n\nMethods\nWe carried out a population-based case–control study in the Lombardy region of Italy.\n\n A total of 6272 case patients in whom infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was confirmed between February 21 and March 11, 2020, were matched to 30,759 beneficiaries of the Regional Health Service (controls) according to sex, age, and municipality of residence.\n\n Information about the use of selected drugs and patients’ clinical profiles was obtained from regional databases of health care use.\n\n Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for associations between drugs and infection, with adjustment for confounders, were estimated by means of logistic regression.\n\n\nResults\nAmong both case patients and controls, the mean (±SD) age was 68±13 years, and 37% were women.\n\n The use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs was more common among case patients than among controls, as was the use of other antihypertensive and non-antihypertensive drugs, and case patients had a worse clinical profile.\n\n Use of ARBs or ACE inhibitors did not show any association with Covid-19 among case patients overall (adjusted odds ratio, 0.95 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.86 to 1.05] for ARBs and 0.96 [95% CI, 0.87 to 1.07] for ACE inhibitors) or among patients who had a severe or fatal course of the disease (adjusted odds ratio, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.63 to 1.10] for ARBs and 0.91 [95% CI, 0.69 to 1.21] for ACE inhibitors), and no association between these variables was found according to sex.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn this large, population-based study, the use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs was more frequent among patients with Covid-19 than among controls because of their higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease.\n\n However, there was no evidence that ACE inhibitors or ARBs affected the risk of

inhibitors might influence the severity of COVID-19. We aimed to evaluate whether continuing versus discontinuing renin–angiotensin system inhibitors (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers) affects outcomes in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19.\nMethods\nThe REPLACE COVID trial was a prospective, randomised, open-label trial done at 20 large referral hospitals in seven countries worldwide.\n\n Eligible participants were aged 18 years and older who were admitted to hospital with COVID-19 and were receiving a renin–angiotensin system inhibitor before admission.\n\n Individuals with contraindications to continuation or discontinuation of renin–angiotensin system inhibitor therapy were excluded.\n\n Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to continuation or discontinuation of their renin–angiotensin system inhibitor using permuted block randomisation, with allocation concealed using a secure web-based randomisation system.\n\n The primary outcome was a global rank score in which participants were ranked across four hierarchical tiers incorporating time to death, duration of mechanical ventilation, time on renal replacement or vasopressor therapy, and multiorgan dysfunction during the hospitalisation.\n\n Primary analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population.\n\n The REPLACE COVID trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.\n\ngov, NCT04338009.\n\n\nFindings\nBetween March 31 and Aug 20, 2020, 152 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to either continue or discontinue renin–angiotensin system inhibitor therapy (continuation group n=75; discontinuation group n=77).\n\n Mean age of participants was 62 years (SD 12), 68 (45%) were female, mean body-mass index was 33 kg/m2 (SD 8), and 79 (52%) had diabetes.\n\n Compared with discontinuation of renin–angiotensin system inhibitors, continuation had no effect on the global rank score (median rank 73 [IQR 40–110] for continuation vs 81 [38–117] for discontinuation; ?-coefficient 8 [95% CI ?13 to 29]).\n\n There were 16 (21%) of 75 participants in the continuation arm versus 14 (18%) of 77 in the discontinuation arm who required intensive care unit admission or invasive mechanical ventilation, and 11 (15%) of 75 participants in the continuation group versus ten (13%) of 77 in the discontinuation group died.\n\n 29 (39%) participants in the continuation group and 28 (36%) participants in the discontinuation group had at least one adverse event (?2 test of adverse events between treatment groups p=0·77).\n\n There was no difference in blood pressure, serum potassium, or creatinine during follow-up across the two groups.\n\n\nInterpretation\nConsistent with international society recommendations, renin–angiotensin system inhibitors can be safely continued in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19.\nFunding\nREPLACE COVID Investigators, REPLACE COVID Trial Social Fundraising Campaign, and

enzyme 2, which can be upregulated by inhibitors of the renin–angiotensin system (RAS).\n\n We aimed to test our hypothesis that discontinuation of chronic treatment with ACE-inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) mitigates the course o\f recent-onset COVID-19.\nMethods\nACEI-COVID was a parallel group, randomised, controlled, open-label trial done at 35 centres in Austria and Germany.\n\n Patients aged 18 years and older were enrolled if they presented with recent symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and were chronically treated with ACEIs or ARBs.\n\n Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to discontinuation or continuation of RAS inhibition for 30 days.\n\n Primary outcome was the maximum sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score within 30 days, where death was scored with the maximum achievable SOFA score.\n\n Secondary endpoints were area under the death-adjusted SOFA score (AUCSOFA), mean SOFA score, admission to the intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, and death.\n\n Analyses were done on a modified intention-to-treat basis.\n\n This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.\n\ngov, NCT04353596.\n\n\nFindings\nBetween April 20, 2020, and Jan 20, 2021, 204 patients (median age 75 years [IQR 66–80], 37% females) were randomly assigned to discontinue (n=104) or continue (n=100) RAS inhibition.\n\n Within 30 days, eight (8%) of 104 died in the discontinuation group and 12 (12%) of 100 patients died in the continuation group (p=0·42).\n\n There was no significant difference in the primary endpoint between the discontinuation and continuation group (median [IQR] maximum SOFA score 0·00 (0·00–2·00) vs 1·00 (0·00–3·00); p=0·12).\n\n Discontinuation was associated with a significantly lower AUCSOFA (0·00 [0·00–9·25] vs 3·50 [0·00–23·50]; p=0·040), mean SOFA score (0·00 [0·00–0·31] vs 0·12 [0·00–0·78]; p=0·040), and 30-day SOFA score (0·00 [10–90th percentile, 0·00–1·20] vs 0·00 [0·00–24·00]; p=0·023).\n\n At 30 days, 11 (11%) in the discontinuation group and 23 (23%) in the continuation group had signs of organ dysfunction (SOFA score ?1) or were dead (p=0·017).\n\n There were no significant differences for mechanical ventilation (10 (10%) vs 8 (8%), p=0·87) and admission to intensive care unit (20 [19%] vs 18 [18%], p=0·96) between the discontinuation and continuation

Using data from 228,722 Veterans with a history of hypertension who received COVID-19 testing at the VA, we investigated whether the use of ACEI or ARB over the two years prior to the index date was associated with increased odds of (1) a positive COVID-19 test, and (2) a severe outcome (hospitalization, mortality, and use of intensive care unit (ICU) and/or mechanical ventilation) among COVID-19-positive patients.\n\n We used logistic regression with and without propensity score weighting (PSW) to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for the association between ACEI/ARB use and a positive COVID-19 test result.\n\n The association between medication use and COVID-19 outcome severity was examined using multinomial logistic regression comparing participants who were not hospitalized to participants who were hospitalized, were admitted to the ICU, used a mechanical ventilator, or died.\n\n All models were adjusted for relevant covariates, including demographics (age, sex, race, ethnicity), selected comorbidities, and the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI).\n\n\nResults\nThe use of ACEI significantly decreased the odds of a positive COVID-19 test among Veterans with hypertension (OR = 0.917, (0.887, 0.948) and OR = 0.926, (0.894, 0.958) with PSW).\n\n The use of ACEI, but not of ARB, was also associated with significantly increased odds of using mechanical ventilators (OR = 1.265, (1.010, 1.584) and OR = 1.210, (1.053, 1.39) with PSW) among all COVID-19 inpatients compared to outpatients.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn this study of Veterans with hypertension, ACEI was significantly associated with decreased odds of testing positive for COVID-19.

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

It has been suggested that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), which are commonly used in patients with hypertension or diabetes and may raise tissue ACE2 levels, could increase the risk of severe COVID-19 infection.\nMethods and results\nWe evaluated this hypothesis in a consecutive cohort of 1200 acute inpatients with COVID-19 at two hospitals with a multi-ethnic catchment population in London (UK). The mean age was 68 +- 17 years (57% male) and 74% of patients had at least one comorbidity. Overall, 415 patients (34.6%) reached the primary endpoint of death or transfer to a critical care unit for organ support within 21 days of symptom onset. A total of 399 patients (33.3%) were taking ACEi or ARB. Patients on ACEi/ARB were significantly older and had more comorbidities. The odds ratio for the primary endpoint in patients on ACEi and ARB, after adjustment for age, sex and co-morbidities, was 0.63 (95% confidence interval 0.47-0.84, P &lt; 0.01).\nConclusions\nThere was no evidence for increased severity of COVID-19 in hospitalised patients on chronic treatment with ACEi or ARB. A trend towards a beneficial effect of ACEi/ARB requires further evaluation in larger meta-analyses and randomised clinical trials.\nIntroduction\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is a major medical and socioeconomic challenge with at least 3 million confirmed cases to date. Data on the clinical characteristics of patients who require hospital admission for COVID-19 from China, Italy and the US consistently show that patients with cardiovascular comorbidities are over-represented and may have an increased risk of severe COVID-19 disease. The reasons underlying the increased incidence of severe COVID-19 infection in those with comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes and other cardiovascular conditions are unknown.\nThe SARS-CoV-2 virus requires the binding of its viral surface spike protein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor expressed on epithelial cells in order to be internalised and then undergo replication. Previous studies suggest that the expression of ACE2 may be increased by chronic treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB). As such, it has been hypothesized that treatment with ACEi or ARB could increase the likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 binding and entry into epithelial or other cells. Furthermore, it is hypothesised that such a mechanism could account for the increased incidence of severe COVID-19 infection among patients with cardiovascular comorbidities, who are frequently treated with ACEi/ARB. Whether or not treatment with ACEi/ARB increases the risk of severe COVID-19 disease is a very important question in view of the large numbers of patients potentially on these drugs, especially in western countries with older populations. The issue is controversial because ACEi/ARB may potentially be beneficial in severe lung injury by reducing activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Furthermore, increased levels of ACE2 itself have been shown to be protective during severe lung injury. The potential effect of ACEi and ARB during infection with SARS-CoV-2 therefore requires urgent clarification.\nWe tested for association between treatment with ACEi/ARB and disease severity in a consecutive series of 1200 patients with COVID-19 disease admitted to two UK hospitals, King's College Hospital and Princess Royal University Hospital, that have been at the epicentre of the pandemic in London. We used an established and validated informatics pipeline to allow rapid evaluation of this important question during the pandemic.\nMethods\nThis project operated under London South East Research Ethics Committee approval (reference 18/LO/2048) granted to the King's Electronic Records Research Interface (KERRI); specific work on COVID-19 research was reviewed with expert patient input on a virtual committee with Caldicott Guardian oversight.\nStudy design\nThe study cohort was defined as all adult inpatients testing positive for COVID-19 by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction at King's College Hospital and Princess Royal University Hospital from 1 March to 13 April 2020. Only symptomatic patients who required inpatient admission were included. Presenting symptoms included but were not limited to fever, cough, dyspnoea, myalgia, chest pain, or delirium. The primary endpoint was defined as death or admission to a critical care unit for organ-support within 21 days of symptom onset. Data were collected for a range of clinical and demographic parameters (Table  1 ). To ascertain chronic treatment with ACEi, ARB and other relevant medications, we captured information from clinical notes, outpatient clinic letters and inpatient medication orders. If a drug was a regular medication in the community but withheld on admission, we considered this to be on chronic treatment. The primary endpoint was manually verified by clinician review of the electronic health record.\nCharacteristics of the 1200 patients positive for COVID-19 at Princess Royal University Hospital and King's College Hospital, London, UK\n	All Patients	On ACEi/ARB	Not on ACEi/ARB	P-value	 	n	1200	399	801		 	Age, years, mean (SD)	67.96 (17.07)	73.02 (13.46)	65.45 (18.1)	&lt;0.001	 	Sex					 	Male	686 (57.2%)	231 (57.9%)	455 (56.8%)	1.0	 	Female	514 (42.8%)	168 (42.1%)	346 (43.2%)	1.0	 	Ethnicity					 	Caucasian	512 (42.7%)	170 (42.6%)	342 (42.7%)	1.0	 	Black	310 (25.8%)	105 (26.3%)	205 (25.6%)	1.0	 	Asian	58 (4.8%)	21 (5.3%)	37 (4.6%)	1.0	 	Unknown/mixed/other	320 (26.7%)	103 (25.8%)	217 (27.1%)	1.0	 	Comorbidity					 	HTN	645 (53.8%)	339 (85.0%)	306 (38.2%)	&lt;0.001	 	Diabetes	418 (34.8%)	215 (53.9%)	203 (25.3%)	&lt;0.001	 	HF	107 (8.9%)	65 (16.3%)	42 (5.2%)	&lt;0.001	 	IHD	160 (13.3%)	83 (20.8%)	77 (9.6%)	&lt;0.001	 	COPD	121 (10.1%)	42 (10.5%)	79 (9.9%)	1.0	 	Asthma	169 (14.1%)	58 (14.5%)	111 (13.9%)	1.0	 	CKD	206 (17.2%)	108 (27.1%)	98 (12.2%)	&lt;0.001	 	Previous stroke/TIA	235 (19.6%)	112 (28.1%)	123 (15.4%)	&lt;0.001	 	BMI, kg/m2, mean (SD)	26.3 (8.7)	27.0 (8.5)	25.8 (8.4)	1.0	 	BMI &gt;=30 kg/m2	182 (15.2%)	69 (17.3%)	113 (14.1%)	1.0	 	No. of comorbidities					 	0	310 (25.8%)	19 (4.8%)	291 (36.3%)	&lt;0.001	 	1	283 (23.6%)	73 (18.3%)	210 (26.2%)	0.08	 	&gt;1	607 (50.6%)	307 (76.9%)	300 (37.5%)	&lt;0.001	 	Drugs					 	ACEi	260 (21.7%)	260 (65.2%)	0 (0.0%)		 	ARB	147 (12.2%)	147 (36.8%)	0 (0.0%)		 	Statin	472 (39.3%)	268 (67.2%)	204 (25.5%)	&lt;0.001	 	Beta-blocker	337 (28.1%)	184 (46.1%)	153 (19.1%)	&lt;0.001	 	Vital signs					 	Systolic BP, mmHg, mean (SD)	124 (27)	126 (28)	123 (26)	0.17	 	Diastolic BP, mmHg, mean (SD)	71 (18)	71 (18)	71 (18)	1.0	 	Primary endpoint by 21 days					 	Death or critical care admission	415 (34.6%)	127 (31.8%)	288 (36.0%)	1.0	 	Death	288 (24.0%)	106 (26.6%)	182 (22.7%)	1.0	 	Critical care admission and alive	127 (10.6%)	21 (5.3%)	106 (13.2%)	&lt;0.01	 	\nData were available on all patients except for ethnicity (n = 925), systolic BP (n = 1120), diastolic BP (n = 1120), BMI (n = 621).\nACEi, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor; ARB, angiotensin II receptor blocker; BMI, body mass index; BP, blood pressure; CKD, chronic kidney disease; COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; HF, heart failure; HTN, hypertension; IHD, ischaemic heart disease; SD, standard deviation; TIA, transient ischaemic attack.\n\nP-value comparing the group on ACEi /ARB vs. not on ACEi/ARB with Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. Continuous variables compared with t-test, binary variables compared with Chi-squared test.\nData processing\nThe data (demographic, emergency department letters, discharge summaries, clinical notes, radiology reports, medication orders, lab results) was retrieved and analysed in near real-time from the structured and unstructured components of the electronic health record using a variety of well-validated natural language processing (NLP) informatics tools belonging to the CogStack ecosystem, namely DrugPipeline, MedCAT and MedCATTrainer. The CogStack NLP pipeline captures negation, synonyms, and acronyms for medical SNOMED-CT concepts as well as surrounding linguistic context using deep learning and long short-term memory networks. DrugPipeline was used to annotate medications and MedCAT produced unsupervised annotations for all SNOMED-CT concepts under parent terms Clinical Finding, Disorder, Organism, and Event with disambiguation, pre-trained on MIMIC-III. Further supervised training improved detection of annotations and meta-annotations such as experiencer (is the concept annotated experienced by the patient or other), negation (is the concept annotated negated or not) and temporality (is the concept annotated in the past or present) with MedCATTrainer. Meta-annotations for hypothetical and experiencer were merged into irrelevant meaning that any concept annotated as either hypothetical or where the experiencer was not the patient was annotated as irrelevant. Performance of the MedCAT NLP pipeline for disorders mentioned in the text was evaluated on 5617 annotations for 265 documents by a domain expert (JTHT) and F1, precision and recall recorded. Additional full case review for correct subsequent diagnosis assignment was performed by three clinicians (JTHT, KOG, RZ) for key comorbidities. The performance of DrugPipeline has previously been described. Manual review of 100 detections gave F1 = 0.91 for exclusion of drug allergies by DrugPipeline.\nStatistical analysis\nIn order to investigate the association between ACEi/ARB and disease severity measured as critical care admission or death, we performed a series of logistic regressions. In a first step, we explored independently the association for ACEi/ARB (baseline model). In a second step, we adjusted the model for age and sex (Model 1). Then, we additionally adjusted for hypertension (Model 2) and finally, additionally adjusted for other comorbidities, i.e. diabetes, ischaemic heart disease, heart failure and chronic kidney disease (Model 3). We also explored the independent association for hypertension following the same modelling approach. In addition, we assessed the robustness to unmeasured confounders of the fully adjusted estimate of ACEi/ARB effect using the e-value approach, which are defined as the minimum strength of association on the risk ratio scale that an unmeasured confounder would need to have with both the treatment assignment and the outcome to fully explain away a specific treatment-outcome association, conditional on the measured covariates. Sensitivity analyses were performed (i) requiring at least two detections of medication for positive exposure; (ii) using only structured data on in-hospital medication orders; (iii) ignoring our 21-day window for medications; and (iv) testing sensitivity to unmeasured confounders.\nRole of the funding source\nThe funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.\nResults\nOur total cohort consisted of 1200 confirmed positive symptomatic inpatients aged 63 +- 20 years with 52% being male (Table  1 ). The patients were of diverse ethnicities with over 30% from minority ethnic groups. Nearly 75% of patients had one or more comorbidities. The commonest comorbidities were hypertension (51.2%), diabetes (30.2%), chronic kidney disease (17.2%), and ischaemic heart disease or heart failure (22.2%). Overall, 15.2% of patients had a body mass index &gt;30 kg/m2. A total of 399 patients (33.2%) were on chronic treatment with ACEi or ARB; 415 of the 1200 patients (34.6%) required admission to the critical care unit or had died within 21 days of symptom onset. Among patients who achieved the primary endpoint (death or critical care admission), the percentage who had positive mentions for various disorders derived via the NLP for medical concept annotations with F1 &gt;80% and more than 10 annotated mentions, as compared to those not achieving the primary endpoint, is shown in Figure  1 . The performance of the NLP pipeline is shown in online supplementary  Figure S1 . Manual validation of the presence of comorbidities was performed in a sample of 200 patients and showed excellent performance, for example a false positive rate of 1% for hypertension and 0% for diabetes.\nDistribution of disorders between patients achieving the primary outcome (death or critical care admission) and those not achieving it by 21 days after symptom onset. The percentage of patients that have a positive mention of a disorder in each of the two groups is shown. All diseases were extracted from free-text using CogStack and MedCAT. Only medical concept annotations with F1 &gt;80%, more than 10 annotated samples and present in at least 10% of either group are shown. Disease names that start &quot;Any:&quot; are aggregate concepts for multiple specific conditions that are used in our analysis. CKD, chronic kidney disease; COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; HTN, hypertension; IHD, ischaemic heart disease.\nWe next compared the outcome of patients on chronic treatment with ACEi/ARB vs. those not on these agents. The group on ACEi/ARB were significantly older but had a similar male/female split and a similar ethnicity profile to those not on ACEi/ARB (Table  1 ). The body mass index was similar between groups. There was a greater proportion of patients with cardiovascular comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, heart failure, ischaemic heart disease) and chronic kidney disease in the group on ACEi/ARB than those not taking these drugs, as would be expected. Therefore, the patients on ACEi/ARB had a higher prevalence of factors associated with worse outcome of COVID-19 disease in prior studies. The ACEi/ARB group also had higher rates of treatment with beta-blockers and statins than those not on ACEi/ARB, consistent with their higher rates of cardiovascular morbidities. Figure  2  shows Kaplan-Meier curves for the primary endpoint in patients on ACEi/ARB and those not on these drugs.\nKaplan-Meier curves for the primary endpoint in COVID-19 patients on chronic treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) vs. those not on these drugs. The unadjusted odds ratio (OR) for the primary endpoint for those on ACEi/ARB was 0.83 (P = 0.16); the adjusted OR was 0.63 (P &lt; 0.01). CI, confidence interval.\nTo assess the independent effect of ACEi/ARB on the primary outcome, we first performed an unadjusted logistic regression analysis. This indicated that the likelihood of a severe outcome was similar in individuals on ACEi/ARB as compared to those not on these drugs, with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.83 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64-1.07] (baseline model in Table  2 ). However, after adjustments for age and sex (Model 1 in Table  2 ), the likelihood of severe disease was significantly lower in those on ACEi/ARBs (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.53-0.91; P &lt; 0.01). Additional adjustment for hypertension (Model 2 in Table  2 ) and for the other major comorbidities, including diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and ischaemic heart disease/heart failure (Model 3 in Table  2 ), had a modest further effect. The OR for the primary outcome in Model 3 was 0.63 (95 CI 0.47-0.84; P &lt; 0.01). Online supplementary  Table S1  shows the OR and P-values for all variables in each model. Male patients were found to have a higher likelihood of severe disease in Model 3 (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.17-1.93; P &lt;0.01).\nSummary of odds ratios for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and/or angiotensin II receptor blocker drug use and the primary endpoint\nModel	Adjustments	OR (95% CI) ACEi/ARB vs. neither drug	P-value	 	Baseline	-	0.83 (0.64-1.07)	0.16	 	Model 1	Age, sex	0.70 (0.53-0.91)	&lt;0.01	 	Model 2	Age, sex, hypertension	0.64 (0.48-0.86)	&lt;0.01	 	Model 3	Age, sex, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, ischaemic heart disease, heart failure	0.63 (0.47-0.84)	&lt;0.01	 	\nACEi, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor; ARB, angiotensin II receptor blocker; CI, confidence interval; OR, odds ratio.\nOR and P-values calculated from logistic regressions.\nWe also examined the independent association between hypertension and disease severity. The results showed that individuals with hypertension had a similar likelihood of suffering a severe outcome as those without hypertension, either in unadjusted models (OR 1.25, 95% CI 0.98-1.59; P = 0.069) or in models adjusted for age and gender (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.80-1.32; P = 0.83).\nSensitivity analyses were performed using criteria for ACEi exposure that were either more strict (requiring multiple mentions in the clinical notes or using only in-hospital medication orders as evidence) or less strict (including any mention of ACEi treatment even outside a 21-day window from onset of symptoms). In all cases, the estimates of the impact of ACEi treatment were consistent with those in Table  2 . In analysis requiring at least two mentions of chronic treatment with ACEi/ARB, we found that this was significant in the uncorrected baseline model (a lower OR). We estimated an e-value of 1.82, which suggests that the estimate, though clearly significant, could yet be vulnerable to possible confounders not yet included.\nDiscussion\nThis study in a large consecutive cohort of 1200 patients in the UK suggests that chronic treatment with ACEi and ARB is not associated with an increase in severe outcome of COVID-19 disease, defined as death or admission to a critical care unit. The hypothetical relationship between treatment with ACEi/ARB and severe COVID-19 disease has been intensely debated. There are theoretical mechanisms whereby chronic treatment with ACEi/ARB might increase propensity to SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as other mechanisms whereby treatment with these agents might be beneficial. It is a particularly important question because chronic treatment with ACEi/ARB is of proven benefit in conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease and heart failure, and an unwarranted cessation of therapy in patients with these conditions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could have serious long-term detrimental effects.\nThe general clinical characteristics and the rates of severe outcome of the patients in our study were broadly similar to those that have been described in recent large series from Italy and the USA. We found that patients who were on chronic treatment with ACEi/ARB had many demographic and comorbidity features that have been associated in previous studies with worse outcome in COVID-19 disease, such as an older age and a higher prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, heart failure and other morbidities. Treatment with ACEi/ARB was nevertheless not associated with an increase in rates of severe outcomes, with or without adjustment for age, sex and comorbidities. A number of very recent studies have now also reported on the relationship between ACEi/ARB and outcome of COVID-19 disease in hospitalised patients. In a single centre study from Wuhan in which only 115 of 1178 patients (&lt;10%) were taking ACEi/ARB, the authors did not find any relationship between these drugs and outcome; the data are however limited by the low numbers on ACEi/ARB and potential confounding by other factors. A second report from China was a retrospective multi-centre study including 1128 patients but again had only 188 patients (16.6%) on treatment with ACEi/ARB. This study suggested that treatment with ACEi/ARB was associated with a lower rate of severe outcome with COVID-19 infection. Mancia et al. reported a case control series from Italy in which 617 patients had severe COVID-19 disease among 6272 SARS-CoV-2 positive cases, and the rates of ACEi/ARB usage were higher. These authors found no association between ACEi/ARB and the likelihood of infection or fatal disease. However, no data on ethnicity were included in this study. At the time of submission, our study was the first to be conducted on an ethnically mixed population in the western world and to include significant proportions of both White and minority ethnic (Black, Asian) patients. The rates of usage of ACEi/ARB in our study (33.2%) are in line with those expected in well-treated patients with comorbidities and are therefore, in principle, more applicable to patients in Europe and the Americas. Ethnicity is a very pertinent issue in this regard due to the recognised ethnicity-related differences in response to drugs affecting the RAS. Of relevance, the ethnicity profiles of the patients on ACEi/ARB in our study were similar to those not taking these drugs. A recent study from New York also reports on a multi-ethnic population among whom 1002 patients developed severe COVID-19 illness. These authors found no evidence of an increased risk of severe COVID-19 in patients taking ACEi or ARB. Finally, an analysis of patients with heart failure reports no association between ACEi/ARB treatment and the concentrations of plasma ACE2. Although the relevance of plasma ACE2 to susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 (which binds to cell surface ACE2) is unclear, this study also fails to provide evidence in support of the theoretical risks of ACEi/ARB with respect to COVID-19.\nIn the current study, when we adjusted for age, sex and comorbidities in logistic regression analyses, the OR for a severe outcome was significantly lower in patients on ACEi/ARB than those not on these agents. This suggestion of a favourable association of treatment with ACEi/ARB and less severe outcome in COVID-19 disease would be consistent with the hypothesised beneficial effects of inhibition of RAS activation in patients with severe lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome. However, due to the possibility of unmeasured confounding factors, the confirmation of a potential therapeutic benefit of treatment with ACEi/ARB in COVID-19 disease would require further studies and randomised controlled trials.\nThis study used an NLP approach to perform very rapid analysis of high volume, unstructured real-world clinical data. This however introduces the possibility of missing circumlocutory mentions of disease, symptoms, or medications. We mitigated against this by manually validating annotations in a subset of records and also verifying drug treatments against inpatient electronic prescription data. Moreover, we performed sensitivity analyses to test the impact of different criteria to define the ACEi/ARB exposed cohort on our results, and found that the OR remained &lt;1.0 and significant for ACEi/ARB exposure in all adjusted analyses. We therefore consider our analysis pipeline to be robust to specific details of the pipeline that are not clinically relevant. However, we did find that the estimated OR may be sensitive to unmeasured confounding, which suggests caution in the interpretation of any protective effect, and the need for replication in a larger sample remains.\nOur study has some potential limitations. Although the patients and data were prospectively collected, the analyses were retrospective. The study was conducted on two hospital sites in a single geographical, albeit ethnically mixed, locus in the UK over a relatively short follow-up period. However, the duration of follow-up is sufficient to accurately detect early severe outcomes based on the data from multiple studies during the current pandemic. We used the covariates identified as important in the previous large case series on COVID-19, including age, sex and common comorbidities, to adjust our analyses. However, it is possible that other unmeasured confounders could have influenced the results. For example, the patients on chronic ACEi/ARB treatment were also more frequently treated with statins than those not on these drugs, which could suggest that their medical conditions were generally better managed. However, the ACEi/ARB group was also older and had higher rates of hypertension, diabetes and multiple morbidities, making it unlikely that these patients were physiologically healthier. Our study was performed in patients with COVID-19 who required hospitalisation; the effect of chronic treatment with ACEi/ARB on less severe infection with SARS-CoV-2 in the non-hospital setting requires further study. Whether the current results are applicable to other global populations, such as in Africa, will also require additional study.\nIn summary, the results of this study in 1200 patients show no evidence of a detrimental effect of chronic treatment with ACEi/ARB in patients presenting with severe COVID-19 infection. Patients on treatment with ACEi/ARB should continue these drugs during their COVID-19 illness as per current European Society of Cardiology guidelines. \nSupporting information\nReferences\nClinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 in China\nBaseline characteristics and outcomes of 1591 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 admitted to ICUs of the Lombardy Region, Italy\nPresenting characteristics, comorbidities, and outcomes among 5700 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the New York City area\nSARS-CoV-2 cell entry depends on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and is blocked by a clinically proven protease inhibitor\nHuman intestine luminal ACE2 and amino acid transporter expression increased by ACE-inhibitors\nCOVID-19 and the cardiovascular system\nRenin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors in patients with Covid-19\nSARS-CoV2: should inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system be withdrawn in patients with COVID-19?\nCOVID-19 and heart failure: from infection to inflammation and angiotensin II stimulation.

highly specialized prostate epithelial cells by tumor cells results in dramatic decrease in ACE production in prostate tissues.\n We performed detailed characterization of ACE status in prostate tissues from patients with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer (PC) using new approach- ACE phenotyping, that includes evaluation of: 1) ACE activity with two substrates (HHL and ZPHL); 2) the ratio of the rates of their hydrolysis (ZPHL/HHL ratio); 3) the ratio of immunoreactive ACE protein to ACE activity; 4) the pattern of mAbs binding to different epitopes on ACE – ACE conformational fingerprint - to reveal conformational changes in prostate ACE due to prostate pathology.\n ACE activity dramatically decreased and the ratio of immunoreactive ACE protein to ACE activity increased in PC tissues.\n The catalytic parameter, ZPHL/HHL ratio, increased in prostate tissues from all patients with PC, but was did not change for most |BPH patients.\n Nevertheless, prostate tissues of several patients diagnosed with BPH based on histology, also demonstrated decreased ACE activity and increased immunoreactive ACE protein/ACE activity and ZPHL/HHL ratios, that could be considered as more early indicators of prostate cancer development than routine histology.\n Thus, ACE phenotyping of prostate biopsies has a potential to be an effective approach for early

mechanisms and applications","abstract":"Viral and bacterial infections are involved in the development of human cancers, such as liver, nasopharyngeal, cervical, head and neck, and gastric cancers.\n Aberrant DNA methylation is frequently present in these cancers, and some of the aberrantly methylated genes are causally involved in cancer development and progression.\n Notably, aberrant DNA methylation can be present even in non-cancerous or precancerous tissues, and its levels correlate with the risk of cancer development, producing a so-called ‘epigenetic field for cancerization’.\n Mechanistically, most viral or bacterial infections induce DNA methylation indirectly via chronic inflammation, but recent studies have indicated that some viruses have direct effects on the epigenetic machinery of host cells.\n From a translational viewpoint, a recent multicenter prospective cohort study demonstrated that assessment of the extent of alterations in DNA methylation in non-cancerous tissues can be used to predict cancer risk.\n Furthermore, suppression of aberrant DNA methylation was shown to be a useful strategy for cancer prevention in an animal model.\n Here, we review the involvement of aberrant DNA methylation in various types of infection-associated cancers, along with individual induction mechanisms, and we discuss the application of these findings for cancer prevention, diagnosis, and therapy.\n","id":"PMC4731931","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

(COVID-19) pandemic.\n Strikingly, men account for the majority of COVID-19 deaths, with current figures ranging from 59% to 75% of total mortality.\n However, despite clear implications in relation to COVID-19 mortality, most research has not considered sex as a critical factor in data analysis.\n Here, we highlight fundamental biological differences that exist between males and females, and how these may make significant contributions to the male-biased COVID-19 mortality.\n We present preclinical evidence identifying the influence of biological sex on the expression and regulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the main receptor used by SARS-CoV-2 to enter cells.\n However, we note that there is a lack of reports showing that sexual dimorphism of ACE2 expression exists and is of functional relevance in humans.\n In contrast, there is strong evidence, especially in the context of viral infections, that sexual dimorphism plays a central role in the genetic and hormonal regulation of immune responses, both of the innate and the adaptive immune system.\n We review evidence supporting that ineffective anti-SARS-CoV-2 responses, coupled with a predisposition for inappropriate hyperinflammatory responses, could provide a biological explanation for the male bias in COVID-19 mortality.\n A prominent finding in COVID-19 is the increased risk of death with pre-existing cardiovascular comorbidities, such as hypertension, obesity, and age.\n We contextualize how important features of sexual dimorphism and inflammation in COVID-19 may exhibit a reciprocal relationship with comorbidities, and explain their increased mortality risk.\n Ultimately, we demonstrate that biological sex is a fundamental variable of critical relevance to our mechanistic understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the pursuit of effective COVID-19 preventative and therapeutic

55%).\n\n Chronic hypertension and other cardiovascular comorbidities were more frequent among deceased patients (54 (48%) and 16 (14%)) than recovered patients (39 (24%) and 7 (4%)).\n\n Dyspnoea, chest tightness, and disorder of consciousness were more common in deceased patients (70 (62%), 55 (49%), and 25 (22%)) than in recovered patients (50 (31%), 48 (30%), and 1 (1%)).\n\n The median time from disease onset to death in deceased patients was 16 (interquartile range 12.0-20.0) days.\n\n Leukocytosis was present in 56 (50%) patients who died and 6 (4%) who recovered, and lymphopenia was present in 103 (91%) and 76 (47%) respectively.\n\n Concentrations of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, creatinine, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, cardiac troponin I, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, and D-dimer were markedly higher in deceased patients than in recovered patients.\n\n Common complications observed more frequently in deceased patients included acute respiratory distress syndrome (113; 100%), type I respiratory failure (18/35; 51%), sepsis (113; 100%), acute cardiac injury (72/94; 77%), heart failure (41/83; 49%), alkalosis (14/35; 40%), hyperkalaemia (42; 37%), acute kidney injury (28; 25%), and hypoxic encephalopathy (23; 20%).\n\n Patients with cardiovascular comorbidity were more likely to develop cardiac complications.\n\n Regardless of history of cardiovascular disease, acute cardiac injury and heart failure were more common in deceased patients.\n\n\nConclusion\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection can cause both pulmonary and systemic inflammation, leading to multi-organ dysfunction in patients at high risk.\n\n Acute respiratory distress syndrome and respiratory failure, sepsis, acute cardiac injury, and heart failure were the most common critical complications during exacerbation of covid-19.\n","id":"PMC7190011","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BMJ Publishing

manifestations, including death.\n\n Several studies and meta-analyses have evaluated the role of hypertension on prognosis, but with important limitations and conflicting results.\n\n Therefore, we decided to perform a new meta-analysis of the observational studies that explored the relationship between pre-existing hypertension and mortality risk in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, using more stringent inclusion criteria to overcome the limitations inherent previous meta-analyses.\n\n\nMethods\nA systematic search of the on-line databases available up to 31 March 2022 was conducted, including peer-reviewed original articles, involving the adult population, where the role of hypertension on mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 infection was determined by Cox-proportional hazard models.\n\n Pooled hazard ratio (HR) was calculated by a random effect model.\n\n Sensitivity, heterogeneity, publication bias, subgroup and meta-regression analyses were performed.\n\n\nResults\nTwenty-six studies (222,083 participants) met the pre-defined inclusion criteria.\n\n In the pooled analysis, pre-existing hypertension was significantly associated with mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, both in unadjusted and adjusted models (HR: 1.55; 95% CI: 1.22 to 1.97).\n\n However, in separate analyses including results adjusted for crucial and strong predictors of mortality during SARS-CoV-2 infection (e.\n\ng.\n\n body weight), the association disappeared.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe results of this meta-analysis indicate that pre-existing hypertension is not an independent predictor of mortality during SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n Further studies should nevertheless be carried out worldwide to evaluate this role, independent of, or in interaction with, other confounders that may affect the mortality risk.\n\n\n","id":"PMC9671636","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"European Federation of Internal Medicine.

(ACE2) is a type I integral membrane that exists in two forms: the first is a transmembrane protein; the second is a soluble catalytic ectodomain of ACE2. The catalytic ectodomain of ACE2 undergoes shedding by a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 17 (ADAM17), in which calmodulin mediates the calcium signaling pathway that is involved in ACE2 release, resulting in a soluble catalytic ectodomain of ACE2 that can be measured as soluble ACE2 plasma activity.\n The shedding of the ACE2 catalytic ectodomain plays a role in cardiac remodeling and endothelial dysfunction and is a predictor of all-cause mortality, including cardiovascular mortality.\n Moreover, considerable evidence supports that the ACE2 catalytic ectodomain is an essential entry receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.\n Additionally, endotoxins and the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1? and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF?) all enhanced soluble catalytic ectodomain ACE2 shedding from the airway epithelia, suggesting that the shedding of ACE2 may represent a mechanism by which viral entry and infection may be controlled such as some types of betacoronavirus.\n In this regard, ACE2 plays an important role in inflammation and thrombotic response, and its down-regulation may aggravate COVID-19 via the renin-angiotensin system, including by promoting pathological changes in lung injury.\n Soluble forms of ACE2 have recently been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n Furthermore, given that vitamin D enhanced the shedding of ACE2, some studies reported that vitamin D treatment is associated with prognosis improvement in COVID-19.

Enzyme 2: SARS-CoV-2 Receptor and Regulator of the Renin-Angiotensin System","abstract":"ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) has a multiplicity of physiological roles that revolve around its trivalent function: a negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system, facilitator of amino acid transport, and the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2 receptor.\n ACE2 is widely expressed, including, in the lungs, cardiovascular system, gut, kidneys, central nervous system, and adipose tissue.\n ACE2 has recently been identified as the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, the infective agent responsible for coronavirus disease 2019, providing a critical link between immunity, inflammation, ACE2, and cardiovascular disease.\n Although sharing a close evolutionary relationship with SARS-CoV, the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 differs in several key amino acid residues, allowing for stronger binding affinity with the human ACE2 receptor, which may account for the greater pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. The loss of ACE2 function following binding by SARS-CoV-2 is driven by endocytosis and activation of proteolytic cleavage and processing.\n The ACE2 system is a critical protective pathway against heart failure with reduced and preserved ejection fraction including, myocardial infarction and hypertension, and against lung disease and diabetes mellitus.\n The control of gut dysbiosis and vascular permeability by ACE2 has emerged as an essential mechanism of pulmonary hypertension and diabetic cardiovascular complications.\n Recombinant ACE2, gene-delivery of Ace2, Ang 1–7 analogs, and Mas receptor agonists enhance ACE2 action and serve as potential therapies for disease conditions associated with an activated renin-angiotensin system.\n rhACE2 (recombinant human ACE2) has completed clinical trials and efficiently lowered or increased plasma angiotensin II and angiotensin 1-7 levels, respectively.\n Our review summarizes the progress over the past 20 years, highlighting the critical role of ACE2 as the novel SARS-CoV-2 receptor and as the negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system, together with implications for the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and associated cardiovascular diseases.\n","id":"PMC7188049","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Lippincott Williams &amp;

coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in critically ill patients, nationwide data on the outcome of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 and PE are still limited.\n\n Thus, we investigated seasonal trends and predictors of in-hospital death in patients with COVID-19 and PE in Germany.\n\n\nMethods\nWe used a German nationwide inpatient sample to analyse data on hospitalisations among COVID-19 patients with and without PE during 2020, and to detect changes in PE prevalence and case fatality in comparison with 2019.\nResults\nWe analysed 176?137 COVID-19 hospitalisations in 2020; PE was recorded in 1.9% (n=3362) of discharge certificates.\n\n Almost one-third of patients with COVID-19 and PE died during the in-hospital course (28.7%) compared with COVID-19 patients without PE (17.7%).\n\n Between 2019 and 2020, numbers of PE-related hospitalisations were largely unchanged (98?485 versus 97?718), whereas the case fatality rate of PE increased slightly in 2020 (from 12.7% to 13.1%; p&lt;0.001).\n\n Differences in case fatality were found between PE patients with and without COVID-19 in 2020 (28.7% versus 12.5%; p&lt;0.001), corresponding to a 3.1-fold increased risk of PE-related death (OR 3.16, 95% CI 2.91–3.42; p&lt;0.001) in the presence of COVID-19.\nConclusions\nIn Germany, the prevalence of PE events during hospitalisations was similar in 2019 and 2020. However, the fatality rate among patients with both COVID-19 and PE was substantially higher than that in those with only one of these diseases, suggesting a life-threatening additive prognostic impact of the COVID-19–PE combination.\n\n\n","id":"PMC9411730","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"European Respiratory Society","authors":[{"firstname":"Lukas","surname":"Hobohm","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ingo","surname":"Sagoschen","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Ingo","surname":"Sagoschen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Stefano","surname":"Barco","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ioannis T.","surname":"Farmakis","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Ioannis T.","surname":"Farmakis","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ugo","surname":"Fedeli","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Ugo","surname":"Fedeli","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sebastian","surname":"Koelmel","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tommaso","surname":"Gori","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Christine","surname":"Espinola-Klein","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Thomas","surname":"Münzel","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Stavros","surname":"Konstantinides","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Karsten","surname":"Keller","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Karsten","surname":"Keller","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.052","date":"2020-02-25","title":"SARS-CoV-2 Cell Entry Depends on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and Is Blocked by a Clinically Proven Protease Inhibitor","abstract":"The recent emergence of the novel, pathogenic SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China and its rapid national and international spread pose a global health emergency.\n Cell entry of coronaviruses depends on binding of the viral spike (S) proteins to cellular receptors and on S protein priming by host cell proteases.\n Unravelling which cellular factors are used by SARS-CoV-2 for entry might provide insights into viral transmission and reveal therapeutic targets.\n Here, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 uses the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 for entry and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming.\n A TMPRSS2 inhibitor approved for clinical use blocked entry and might constitute a treatment option.\n Finally, we show that the sera from convalescent SARS patients cross-neutralized SARS-2-S-driven entry.\n Our results reveal important commonalities between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection and identify a potential target for antiviral intervention.\n","id":"PMC7102627","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Inc.","authors":[{"firstname":"Markus","surname":"Hoffmann","email":"mhoffmann@dpz.eu","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hannah","surname":"Kleine-Weber","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Simon","surname":"Schroeder","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nadine","surname":"Krüger","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tanja","surname":"Herrler","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sandra","surname":"Erichsen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tobias S.","surname":"Schiergens","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Georg","surname":"Herrler","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nai-Huei","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Andreas","surname":"Nitsche","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Marcel A.","surname":"Müller","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christian","surname":"Drosten","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Stefan","surname":"Pöhlmann","email":"spoehlmann@dpz.eu","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1177/1745691614568352","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Loneliness and social isolation as risk factors for mortality: a meta-analytic review","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.vph.2017.05.005","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species in endothelial dysfunction associated with cardiovascular and metabolic diseases","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.cpcardiol.2022.101541","date":"1970-01-01","title":"COVID-19, Heart Failure Hospitalizations, and Outcomes: A Nationwide Analysis","abstract":"Heart Failure (HF) patients are at a higher risk of adverse events associated with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n Large population-based reports of the impact of COVID-19 on patients hospitalized with HF are limited.\n The National Inpatient Sample database was queried for HF admissions during 2020 in the United States (US), with and without a diagnosis of COVID-19 based on ICD-10-CM U07.

complications.\n Several studies have identified metabolic signatures and disrupted metabolic pathways associated with COVID-19, however there are no reports evaluating the role of obesity in the COVID-19 metabolic regulation.\n In this study we highlight the involvement of obesity metabolically in affecting SARS-CoV-2 infection and the consequent health complications, mainly cardiovascular disease.\n We measured one hundred and forty-four (144) metabolites using ultra high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF-MS) to identify metabolic changes in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, in lean and obese COVID-19 positive (n=82) and COVID-19 negative (n=24) patients.\n The identified metabolites are found to be mainly correlating with glucose, energy and steroid metabolisms.\n Further data analysis indicated twelve (12) significantly yet differentially abundant metabolites associated with viral infection and health complications, in COVID-19 obese patients.\n Two of the detected metabolites, n6-acetyl-l-lysine and p-cresol, are detected only among the COVID-19 cohort, exhibiting significantly higher levels in COVID-19 obese patients when compared to COVID-19 lean patients.\n These metabolites have important roles in viral entry and could explain the increased susceptibility of obese patients.\n On the same note, a set of six metabolites associated with antiviral and anti-inflammatory functions displayed significantly lower abundance in COVID-19 obese patients.\n In conclusion, this report highlights the plasma metabolome of COVID-19 obese patients as a metabolic feature and signature to help improve clinical outcomes.\n We propose n6-acetyl-l-lysine and p-cresol as potential metabolic markers which warrant

coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection is one of the key determinants of COVID-19 severity and mortality.\n SARS-CoV-2 entry to host cells is initiated by binding with its receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2, and the ACE2 abundance is thought to reflect the susceptibility to infection.\n Here, we report that ibudilast, which we previously identified as a potent inhibitor of protein complex between transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) 3 and NADPH oxidase (Nox) 2, attenuates the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein pseudovirus-evoked contractile and metabolic dysfunctions of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs).\n Epidemiologically reported risk factors of severe COVID-19, including cigarette sidestream smoke (CSS) and anti-cancer drug treatment, commonly upregulate ACE2 expression level, and these were suppressed by inhibiting TRPC3-Nox2 complex formation.\n Exposure of NRCMs to SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, as well as CSS and doxorubicin (Dox), induces ATP release through pannexin-1 hemi-channels, and this ATP release potentiates pseudovirus entry to NRCMs and human iPS cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPS-CMs).\n As the pseudovirus entry followed by production of reactive oxygen species was attenuated by inhibiting TRPC3-Nox2 complex in hiPS-CMs, we suggest that TRPC3-Nox2 complex formation triggered by panexin1-mediated ATP release participates in exacerbation of myocardial

In this narrative review, we discuss how the pandemic may affect general CV risk for years to come and explore the mitigating potential of telehealth interventions.\n From a health care perspective, the shift away from in-person office visits may have led many to defer routine risk- factor management and may have had unforeseen effects on continuity of care and adherence.\n Fear of COVID-19 has led some patients to forego care for acute CV events.\n Curtailment of routine outpatient laboratory testing has likely delayed intensification of risk-factor–modifying medical therapy, and drug shortages and misinformation may have negative impacts on adherence to antihypertensive, glucose-lowering, and lipid-lowering agents.\n From a societal perspective, the unprecedented curtailment of social and economic activities has led to loss of income, unemployment, social isolation, decreased physical activity, and increased frequency of depression and anxiety, all of which are known to be associated with worse CV risk-factor control and outcomes.\n We must embrace and evaluate measures to mitigate these potential harms to avoid an epidemic of CV morbidity and mortality in the coming years that could dwarf the initial health effects of COVID-19.","id":"PMC7667463","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Canadian Cardiovascular Society.

The mortality data were also acquired.\n\n Then we assessed the incidence and mortality trends of MetS in the United States.\n\n\nResults\nOur study included 14171 participants with a mean age of 46.8 ± 19.3 years, of whom 7354 (51.9%) were women.\n\n Among them, 4789 participants were subsequently diagnosed with MetS.\n\n From 1999 to 2014, the overall trend of MetS incidence increased (from 27.6

(LDL) receptors with a role in cholesterol metabolism and cardiovascular disease.\n It has since emerged as a major risk factor (causative gene) for Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative disorders.\n Detailed understanding of the structural features of the three isoforms (apoE2, apoE3, and apoE4), which differ by only a single amino acid interchange, has elucidated their unique functions.\n ApoE2 and apoE4 increase the risk for heart disease: apoE2 increases atherogenic lipoprotein levels (it binds poorly to LDL receptors), and apoE4 increases LDL levels (it binds preferentially to triglyceride-rich, very low density lipoproteins, leading to downregulation of LDL receptors).\n ApoE4 also increases the risk for neurodegenerative diseases, decreases their age of onset, or alters their progression.\n ApoE4 likely causes neurodegeneration secondary to its abnormal structure, caused by an interaction between its carboxyl- and amino-terminal domains, called domain interaction.\n When neurons are stressed or injured, they synthesize apoE to redistribute cholesterol for neuronal repair or remodeling.\n However, because of its altered structure, neuronal apoE4 undergoes neuron-specific proteolysis, generating neurotoxic fragments (12–29 kDa) that escape the secretory pathway and cause mitochondrial dysfunction and cytoskeletal alterations, including tau phosphorylation.\n ApoE4-associated pathology can be prevented by small-molecule structure correctors that block domain interaction by converting apoE4 to a molecule that resembles apoE3 both structurally and functionally.\n Structure correctors are a potential therapeutic approach to reduce apoE4 pathology in both cardiovascular and neurological disorders.\n","id":"PMC4921111","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","authors":[{"firstname":"Robert

pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiorgan failure in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n However, the molecular mechanisms underlying endothelial activation in COVID-19 patients remain unclear.\n In this study, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral proteins that potently activate human endothelial cells were screened to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in endothelial activation.\n It was found that nucleocapsid protein (NP) of SARS-CoV-2 significantly activated human endothelial cells through Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)/NF-?B and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways.\n Moreover, by screening a natural microbial compound library containing 154 natural compounds, simvastatin was identified as a potent inhibitor of NP-induced endothelial activation.\n Remarkably, though the protein sequences of N proteins from coronaviruses are highly conserved, only NP from SARS-CoV-2 induced endothelial activation.\n The NPs from other coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), HUB1-CoV, and influenza virus H1N1 did not activate endothelial cells.\n These findings are consistent with the results from clinical investigations showing broad endotheliitis and organ injury in severe COVID-19 patients.\n In conclusion, the

Spike Protein Induces Degradation of Junctional Proteins That Maintain Endothelial Barrier Integrity","abstract":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) uses the Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor present on the cell surface to enter cells.\n Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 is present in many cell types including endothelial cells, where it functions to protect against oxidative damage.\n There is growing evidence to suggest that coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients exhibit a wide range of post-recovery symptoms and shows signs related to cardiovascular and specifically, endothelial damage.\n We hypothesized that these vascular symptoms might be associated with disrupted endothelial barrier integrity.\n This was investigated in vitro using endothelial cell culture and recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 Receptor-Binding Domain (Spike).\n Mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells from normal (C57BL/6 mice) and diabetic (db/db) mice were used.\n An endothelial transwell permeability assay revealed increased permeability in diabetic cells as well as after Spike treatment.\n The expression of VE-Cadherin, an endothelial adherens junction protein, JAM-A, a tight junctional protein, Connexin-43, a gap junctional protein, and PECAM-1, were all decreased significantly after Spike treatment in control and to a greater extent, in diabetic cells.\n In control cells, Spike treatment increased association of endothelial junctional proteins with Rab5a, a mediator of the endocytic trafficking compartment.\n In cerebral arteries isolated from control and diabetic animals, Spike protein had a greater effect in downregulating expression of endothelial junctional proteins in arteries from diabetic animals than from control animals.\n In conclusion, these experiments reveal that Spike-induced degradation of endothelial junctional proteins affects endothelial barrier function and is the likely cause of vascular damage observed in COVID-19 affected individuals.\n","id":"PMC8225996","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Frontiers Media

A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","abstract":"Recent meta-analysis studies have reported that metabolic comorbidities such as diabetes, obesity, dyslipidaemia and hypertension are associated with higher risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and mortality in patients with COVID-19. This meta-analysis aims to investigate the relationship between metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its components with SARS and mortality in COVID-19 patients.\n Methods: A systematic search was conducted in the several databases up until 1 September 2021. Primary observational longitudinal studies published in peer review journals were selected.\n Two independent reviewers performed title and abstract screening, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale.\n Results: The random effects meta-analysis showed that MetS was significantly associated with SARS with a pooled OR (95% CI) of 3.21 (2.88–3.58) and mortality with a pooled OR (95% CI) of 2.32 (1.16–4.63).\n According to SARS, the pooled OR for MetS was 2.19 (1.71–2.67), p &lt; 0.001; significantly higher than the hypertension component.\n With regard to mortality, although the pooled OR for MetS was greater than for its individual components, no significant differences were observed.\n Conclusions: this meta-analysis of cohort studies, showed that MetS is better associated to SARS and mortality in COVID-19 patients than its individual

Role of Platelet-Endothelium Interactions in the Pathogenesis of Severe SARS-CoV-2 Infection-Associated Myocardial Injury","abstract":"Cardiovascular dysfunction and disease are common and frequently fatal complications of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.\n Indeed, from early on during the SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic it was recognized that cardiac complications may occur, even in patients with no underlying cardiac disorders, as part of the acute infection, and that these were associated with more severe disease and increased morbidity and mortality.\n The most common cardiac complication is acute cardiac injury, defined by significant elevation of cardiac troponins.\n The potential mechanisms of cardiovascular complications include direct viral myocardial injury, systemic inflammation induced by the virus, sepsis, arrhythmia, myocardial oxygen supply-demand mismatch, electrolyte abnormalities, and hypercoagulability.\n This review is focused on the prevalence, risk factors and clinical course of COVID-19-related myocardial injury, as well as on current data with regard to disease pathogenesis, specifically the interaction of platelets with the vascular endothelium.\n The latter section includes consideration of the role of SARS-CoV-2 proteins in triggering development of a generalized endotheliitis that, in turn, drives intense activation of platelets.\n Most prominently, SARS-CoV-2–induced endotheliitis involves interaction of the viral spike protein with endothelial angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) together with alternative mechanisms that involve the nucleocapsid and viroporin.\n In addition, the mechanisms by which activated platelets intensify endothelial activation and dysfunction, seemingly driven by release of the platelet-derived calcium-binding proteins, SA100A8 and SA100A9, are described.\n These events create a SARS-CoV-2–driven cycle of intravascular inflammation and coagulation, which contributes significantly to a poor clinical outcome in patients with severe disease.\n","id":"PMC8854752","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Frontiers Media

started in the Western world, with the spread of the Western lifestyle across the globe, it has become now a truly global problem.\n The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome is often more in the urban population of some developing countries than in its Western counterparts.\n The two basic forces spreading this malady are the increase in consumption of high calorie-low fiber fast food and the decrease in physical activity due to mechanized transportations and sedentary form of leisure time activities.\n The syndrome feeds into the spread of the diseases like type 2 diabetes, coronary diseases, stroke, and other disabilities.\n The total cost of the malady including the cost of health care and loss of potential economic activity is in trillions.\n The present trend is not sustainable unless a magic cure is found (unlikely) or concerted global/governmental/societal efforts are made to change the lifestyle that is promoting it.\n There are certainly some elements in the causation of the metabolic syndrome that cannot be changed but many are amenable for corrections and curtailments.\n For example, better urban planning to encourage active lifestyle, subsidizing consumption of whole grains and possible taxing high calorie snacks, restricting media advertisement of unhealthy food, etc.\n Revitalizing old fashion healthier lifestyle, promoting old-fashioned foods using healthy herbs rather than oil and sugar, and educating people about choosing healthy/wholesome food over junks are among the steps that can be

By extracting and analyzing all available published clinical data, we identified several major clinical characteristics associated with increased disease severity and mortality among patients with COVID-19. Specifically, preexisting chronic conditions such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes are strongly associated with an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19; surprisingly, however, we found no correlation between chronic liver disease and increased disease severity.\n In addition, we found that both acute cardiac injury and acute kidney injury are highly correlated with an increased risk of COVID-19-related mortality.\n Given the high risk of comorbidity and the high mortality rate associated with tissue damage, organ function should be monitored closely in patients diagnosed with COVID-19, and this approach should be included when establishing new guidelines for managing these high-risk patients.\n Moreover, additional clinical data are needed in order to determine whether a supportive therapy can help mitigate the development of severe, potentially fatal complications, and further studies are needed to identify the pathophysiology and the mechanism underlying this novel coronavirus-associated infectious disease.\n Taken together, these findings provide new insights regarding clinical strategies for improving the management and outcome of patients with COVID-19.","id":"PMC7187729","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"AAAS","authors":[{"firstname":"Xinhui","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuexian","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuexian","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhaoxian","surname":"Cai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhaoxian","surname":"Cai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaotian","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaotong","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaotong","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Junxia","surname":"Min","email":"junxiamin@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Junxia","surname":"Min","email":"junxiamin@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fudi","surname":"Wang","email":"fwang@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fudi","surname":"Wang","email":"fwang@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2002032","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China","abstract":"Background\nSince December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020.

patients and controls, the mean (±SD) age was 68±13 years, and 37% were women.\n\n The use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs was more common among case patients than among controls, as was the use of other antihypertensive and non-antihypertensive drugs, and case patients had a worse clinical profile.\n\n Use of ARBs or ACE inhibitors did not show any association with Covid-19 among case patients overall (adjusted odds ratio, 0.95 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.86 to 1.05] for ARBs and 0.96 [95% CI, 0.87 to 1.07] for ACE inhibitors) or among patients who had a severe or fatal course of the disease (adjusted odds ratio, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.63 to 1.10] for ARBs and 0.91 [95% CI, 0.69 to 1.21] for ACE inhibitors), and no association between these variables was found according to sex.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn this large, population-based study, the use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs was more frequent among patients with Covid-19 than among controls because of their higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease.\n\n However, there was no evidence that ACE inhibitors or ARBs affected the risk of COVID-19.\n","id":"PMC7206933","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical

inhibitors might influence the severity of COVID-19. We aimed to evaluate whether continuing versus discontinuing renin–angiotensin system inhibitors (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers) affects outcomes in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19.\nMethods\nThe REPLACE COVID trial was a prospective, randomised, open-label trial done at 20 large referral hospitals in seven countries worldwide.\n\n Eligible participants were aged 18 years and older who were admitted to hospital with COVID-19 and were receiving a renin–angiotensin system inhibitor before admission.\n\n Individuals with contraindications to continuation or discontinuation of renin–angiotensin system inhibitor therapy were excluded.\n\n Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to continuation or discontinuation of their renin–angiotensin system inhibitor using permuted block randomisation, with allocation concealed using a secure web-based randomisation system.\n\n The primary outcome was a global rank score in which participants were ranked across four hierarchical tiers incorporating time to death, duration of mechanical ventilation, time on renal replacement or vasopressor therapy, and multiorgan dysfunction during the hospitalisation.\n\n Primary analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population.\n\n The REPLACE COVID trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.\n\ngov, NCT04338009.\n\n\nFindings\nBetween March 31 and Aug 20, 2020, 152 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to either continue or discontinue renin–angiotensin system inhibitor therapy (continuation group n=75; discontinuation group n=77).\n\n Mean age of participants was 62 years (SD 12), 68 (45%) were female, mean body-mass index was 33 kg/m2 (SD 8), and 79 (52%) had diabetes.\n\n Compared with discontinuation of renin–angiotensin system inhibitors, continuation had no effect on the global rank score (median rank 73 [IQR 40–110] for continuation vs 81 [38–117] for discontinuation; ?-coefficient 8 [95% CI ?13 to 29]).\n\n There were 16 (21%) of 75 participants in the continuation arm versus 14 (18%) of 77 in the discontinuation arm who required intensive care unit admission or invasive mechanical ventilation, and 11 (15%) of 75 participants in the continuation group versus ten (13%) of 77 in the discontinuation group died.\n\n 29 (39%) participants in the continuation group and 28 (36%) participants in the discontinuation group had at least one adverse event (?2 test of adverse events between treatment groups p=0·77).\n\n There was no difference in

angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) mitigates the course o\f recent-onset COVID-19.\nMethods\nACEI-COVID was a parallel group, randomised, controlled, open-label trial done at 35 centres in Austria and Germany.\n\n Patients aged 18 years and older were enrolled if they presented with recent symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and were chronically treated with ACEIs or ARBs.\n\n Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to discontinuation or continuation of RAS inhibition for 30 days.\n\n Primary outcome was the maximum sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score within 30 days, where death was scored with the maximum achievable SOFA score.\n\n Secondary endpoints were area under the death-adjusted SOFA score (AUCSOFA), mean SOFA score, admission to the intensive care unit,

They were randomized in two groups.\n\n The former dosage of ACEis/ARBs was continued in one group while in another group, the ACEis/ARBs were replaced by amlodipine ± carvedilol according to the dose equivalents.\n\n The primary outcomes were length of stay in hospitals and intensive care units.\n\n Other outcomes include mechanical ventilation, non-invasive ventilation, readmission, and COVID-19 symptoms after discharge.\n\n\nResults\n We randomized 64 patients with COVID-19 into two groups.\n\n Most patients were aged 66-80 and 46-65 years-old, 33 (51.6%) and 27 (42.2%), respectively.\n\n The study groups were nearly similar in baseline vital signs and characteristics.\n\n In addition, there was no significant difference in terms of recorded systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements between groups.\n\n Furthermore, we did not find a significant difference between the days of intensive care unit or ward admission, the discharge rate, or readmission rates between the two groups.\n\n\nConclusions\n This randomized triple-blind multi-centric clinical trial did not show any deleterious effects of ACEi/ARB medications in hypertensive COVID-19 patients.\n\n\n","id":"PMC8344947","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Oxford University Press","authors":[{"firstname":"Farhad","surname":"Najmeddin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Maedeh","surname":"Solhjoo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Haleh","surname":"Ashraf","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mohammadreza","surname":"Salehi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fatemeh","surname":"Rasooli","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Morteza","surname":"Ghoghaei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Abbas","surname":"Soleimani","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Maryam","surname":"Bahreini","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1002/sim.5984","date":"2013-09-03","title":"The use of propensity score methods with survival or time-to-event outcomes: reporting measures of effect similar to those used in randomized experiments","abstract":"Propensity score methods are increasingly being used to estimate causal treatment effects in observational studies.\n In medical and epidemiological studies, outcomes are frequently time-to-event in nature.\n Propensity-score methods are often applied incorrectly when estimating the effect of treatment on time-to-event outcomes.\n This article describes how two different propensity score methods (matching and inverse probability of treatment weighting) can be used to estimate the measures of effect that are frequently reported in randomized controlled trials: (i) marginal survival curves, which describe survival in the population if all subjects were treated or if all subjects were untreated; and (ii) marginal hazard ratios.\n The use of these propensity score methods allows one to replicate the measures of effect that are commonly reported in randomized controlled trials with time-to-event outcomes: both absolute and relative reductions in the probability of an event occurring can be determined.\n We also provide guidance on variable selection for the propensity score model, highlight methods for assessing the balance of baseline covariates between treated and untreated subjects, and describe the implementation of a sensitivity analysis to assess the effect of unmeasured confounding variables on the estimated treatment effect when outcomes are time-to-event in nature.\n The methods in the paper are illustrated by estimating the effect of discharge statin prescribing on the risk of death in a sample of patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction.\n In this tutorial article, we describe and illustrate all the steps necessary to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the effect of treatment on time-to-event outcomes.\n © 2013 The authors.\n Statistics in Medicine published by John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.\n","id":"PMC4285179","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BlackWell Publishing Ltd","authors":[{"firstname":"Peter C","surname":"Austin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1093/eurheartj/ehs114","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Do observational studies using propensity score methods agree with randomized trials?

(ACEIs) and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) in COVID-19 disease susceptibility, severity, and treatment is unclear.\n\n\nPurpose:\nTo evaluate, on an ongoing basis, whether use of ACEIs or ARBs either increases risk for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection or is associated with worse COVID-19 disease outcomes, and to assess the efficacy of these medications for COVID-19 treatment.\n\n\nData Sources:\nMEDLINE (Ovid) and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from 2003 to 4 May 2020, with planned ongoing surveillance for 1 year; the World Health Organization database of COVID-19 publications and medRxiv.\n\norg through 17 April 2020; and ClinicalTrials.\n\ngov to 24 April 2020, with planned ongoing surveillance.\n\n\nStudy Selection:\nObservational studies and trials in adults that examined associations and effects of ACEIs or ARBs on risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease severity and mortality.\n\n\nData Extraction:\nSingle-reviewer abstraction confirmed by another reviewer, independent evaluation by 2 reviewers of study quality, and collective assessment of certainty of evidence.\n\n\nData Synthesis:\nTwo retrospective cohort studies found that ACEI and ARB use was not associated with a higher likelihood of receiving a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result, and 1 case–control study found no association with COVID-19 illness in a large community (moderate-certainty evidence).\n\n Fourteen observational studies, involving a total of 23 565 adults with COVID-19, showed consistent evidence that neither medication was associated with more severe COVID-19 illness (high-certainty evidence).\n\n Four registered randomized trials plan to evaluate ACEIs and ARBs for treatment of COVID-19.\nLimitation:\nHalf the studies were small and did not adjust for important confounding variables.\n\n\nConclusion:\nHigh-certainty evidence suggests that ACEI or ARB use is not associated with more severe COVID-19 disease, and moderate-certainty evidence suggests no association between use of these medications and positive SARS-CoV-2 test results among symptomatic patients.\n\n Whether these medications increase the risk for mild or asymptomatic disease or are beneficial in COVID-19 treatment remains uncertain.\n\n\nPrimary Funding Source:\nNone.\n\n (PROSPERO: registration number

with confirmed COVID-19 in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from January 1st to February 5th.\n\n The cases were divided into general and refractory COVID-19 groups according to the clinical efficacy after hospitalization, and the difference between groups were compared.\n\n\nResults\nCompared with general COVID-19 patients (45.2%), refractory patients had an older age, male sex, more underlying comorbidities, lower incidence of fever, higher levels of maximum temperature among fever cases, higher incidence of breath shortness and anorexia, severer disease assessment on admission, high levels of neutrophil, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and C-reactive protein, lower levels of platelets and albumin, and higher incidence of bilateral pneumonia and pleural effusion (P&lt;0.05).\n\n Refractory COVID-19 patients were more likely to receive oxygen, mechanical ventilation, expectorant, and adjunctive treatment including corticosteroid, antiviral drugs and immune enhancer (P&lt;0.05).\n\n After adjustment, those with refractory COVID-19 were also more likely to have a male sex and manifestations of anorexia and fever on admission, and receive

COVID-19 according to sputum testing on the day of admission.\n\n He also had elevated troponin I (Trop I) level (up to 11.37 g/L) and diffuse myocardial dyskinesia along with a decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) on echocardiography.\n\n The highest level of interleukin-6 was 272.40 pg/ml.\n\n Bedside chest radiographs showed typical ground-glass changes indicative of viral pneumonia.\n\n Laboratory test results for viruses that cause myocarditis were all negative.\n\n The patient conformed to the diagnostic criteria of the Chinese expert consensus statement for fulminant myocarditis.\n\n After receiving antiviral therapy and mechanical life support, Trop I was reduced to 0.10 g/L, and interleukin-6 was reduced to 7.63 pg/mL.\n\n Moreover, the LVEF of the patient gradually recovered to 68%.\n\n The patient died of aggravation of secondary infection on the 33rd day of hospitalization.\n\n\nConclusion\nid='Par3'>COVID-19 patients may develop severe cardiac complications such as myocarditis and heart failure.\n\n This is the first report of COVID-19 complicated with fulminant myocarditis.\n\n The mechanism of cardiac pathology caused by COVID-19 needs further study.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7146072","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Springer Berlin

Initial immune and inflammatory responses induce a severe cytokine storm [interleukin (IL)-6, IL-7, IL-22, IL-17, etc.\n] during the rapid progression phase of COVID-19. Early evaluation and continued monitoring of cardiac damage (cTnI and NT-proBNP) and coagulation (D-dimer) after hospitalization may identify patients with cardiac injury and predict COVID-19 complications.\n Preventive measures (social distancing and social isolation) also increase cardiovascular risk.\n Cardiovascular considerations of therapies currently used, including remdesivir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, ribavirin, interferons, and lopinavir/ritonavir, as well as experimental therapies, such as human recombinant ACE2 (rhACE2), are discussed.\n","id":"PMC7197627","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Oxford University Press","authors":[{"firstname":"Tomasz

and we consider the possibility of inferring information despite de-identification.\n\n\nResults\nTrue PIs were masked with 98.8% precision and 97.6% recall.\n\n As anticipated, potential PIs did appear, owing to misspellings entered within the EHRs.\n\n We found one potential breach.\n\n In a separate performance test, with a different set of notes, CRIS yielded 100% precision and 88.5% recall, while MIST yielded a 95.1% and 78.1%, respectively.\n\n We discuss how we overcome the realistic possibility – albeit of low probability – of potential breaches through implementation of the security model.\n\n\nConclusion\nCRIS is a de-identified psychiatric database sourced from EHRs, which protects patient anonymity and maximises data available for research.\n\n CRIS demonstrates the advantage of combining an effective de-identification algorithm with a carefully designed security model.\n\n The paper advances much needed discussion of EHR de-identification – particularly in relation to criteria to assess de-identification, and considering the contexts of de-identified research databases when assessing the risk of breaches of confidential patient information.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3751474","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Andrea C","surname":"Fernandes","email":"andrea.1.fernandes@kcl.ac.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Danielle","surname":"Cloete","email":"dcloete@hotmail.co.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Matthew TM","surname":"Broadbent","email":"matthew.broadbent@kcl.ac.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Richard D","surname":"Hayes","email":"Richard.hayes@kcl.ac.uk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chin-Kuo","surname":"Chang","email":"chin-kuo.chang@kcl.ac.uk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Richard G","surname":"Jackson","email":"richard.g.jackson@slam.nhs.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Angus","surname":"Roberts","email":"a.roberts@sheffield.ac.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jason","surname":"Tsang","email":"jason.tsang@kcl.ac.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Murat","surname":"Soncul","email":"murat.soncul@slam.nhs.uk","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Jennifer","surname":"Liebscher","email":"Jennifer.liebscher@kcl.ac.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Robert","surname":"Stewart","email":"Robert.stewart@kcl.ac.uk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Felicity","surname":"Callard","email":"felicity.callard@kcl.ac.uk","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1136/amiajnl-2011-000183","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Automated concept-level information extraction to reduce the need for custom software and rules development","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"An Overview of the Tesseract OCR Engine","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0112774","date":"2014-10-18","title":"Negation’s Not Solved: Generalizability Versus Optimizability in Clinical Natural Language Processing","abstract":"A review of published work in clinical natural language processing (NLP) may suggest that the negation detection task has been “solved.\n” This work proposes that an optimizable solution does not equal a generalizable solution.\n We introduce a new machine learning-based Polarity Module for detecting negation in clinical text, and extensively compare its performance across domains.\n Using four manually annotated corpora of clinical text, we show that negation detection performance suffers when there is no in-domain development (for manual methods) or training data (for machine learning-based methods).\n Various factors (e.\ng.\n, annotation guidelines, named entity characteristics, the amount of data, and lexical and syntactic context) play a role in making generalizability difficult, but none completely explains the phenomenon.\n Furthermore, generalizability remains challenging because it is unclear whether to use a single source for accurate data, combine all sources into a single model, or apply domain adaptation methods.\n The most reliable means to improve negation detection is to manually annotate in-domain training data (or, perhaps, manually modify rules);

sequencing, imaging, sensor, societal and publicly available data present a rapidly expanding digital trace of health.\n\n We aimed to critically review, for the first time, the challenges and potential of big data across early and late stages of translational cardiovascular disease research.\n\n\nMethods and results\nWe sought exemplars based on literature reviews and expertise across the BigData@Heart Consortium.\n\n We identified formidable challenges including: data quality, knowing what data exist, the legal and ethical framework for their use, data sharing, building and maintaining public trust, developing standards for defining disease, developing tools for scalable, replicable science and equipping the clinical and scientific work force with new inter-disciplinary skills.\n\n Opportunities claimed for big health record data include: richer profiles of health and disease from birth to death and from the molecular to the societal scale; accelerated understanding of disease causation and progression, discovery of new mechanisms and treatment-relevant disease sub-phenotypes, understanding health and diseases in whole populations and whole health systems and returning actionable feedback loops to improve (and potentially disrupt) existing models of research and care, with greater efficiency.\n\n In early translational research we identified exemplars including: discovery of fundamental biological processes e.\n\ng.\n\n linking exome sequences to lifelong electronic health records (EHR) (e.\n\ng.\n\n human knockout experiments); drug development: genomic approaches to drug target validation; precision medicine: e.\n\ng.\n\n DNA integrated into hospital EHR for pre-emptive pharmacogenomics.\n\n In late translational research we identified exemplars including: learning health systems with outcome trials integrated into clinical care; citizen driven health with 24/7 multi-parameter patient monitoring to improve outcomes and population-based linkages of multiple EHR sources for higher resolution clinical epidemiology and public health.\n\n\nConclusion\nHigh volumes of inherently diverse (‘big’) EHR data are beginning to

and extraction services in a large National Health Service Foundation Trust hospital","abstract":"Background\nTraditional health information systems are generally devised to support clinical data collection at the point of care.\n\n However, as the significance of the modern information economy expands in scope and permeates the healthcare domain, there is an increasing urgency for healthcare organisations to offer information systems that address the expectations of clinicians, researchers and the business intelligence community alike.\n\n Amongst other emergent requirements, the principal unmet need might be defined as the 3R principle (right data, right place, right time) to address deficiencies in organisational data flow while retaining the strict information governance policies that apply within the UK National Health Service (NHS).\n\n Here, we describe our work on creating and deploying a low cost structured and unstructured information retrieval and extraction architecture within King’s College Hospital, the management of governance concerns and the associated use cases and cost saving opportunities that such components present.\n\n\nResults\nTo date, our CogStack architecture has processed over 300 million lines of clinical data, making it available for internal service improvement projects at King’s College London.\n\n On generated data designed to simulate real world clinical text, our de-identification algorithm achieved up to 94% precision and up to 96% recall.\n\n\nConclusion\nWe describe a toolkit which we feel is of huge value to the UK (and beyond) healthcare community.\n\n It is the only open source, easily deployable solution designed for the UK healthcare environment, in a landscape populated by expensive proprietary systems.\n\n Solutions such as these provide a crucial foundation for the genomic revolution in medicine.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6020175","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

Risk Score focusing on older people in acute care settings using electronic hospital records: an observational study","abstract":"Background\nOlder people are increasing users of health care globally.\n\n We aimed to establish whether older people with characteristics of frailty and who are at risk of adverse health-care outcomes could be identified using routinely collected data.\n\n\nMethods\nA three-step approach was used to develop and validate a Hospital Frailty Risk Score from International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnostic codes.\n\n First, we carried out a cluster analysis to identify a group of older people (?75 years) admitted to hospital who had high resource use and diagnoses associated with frailty.\n\n Second, we created a Hospital Frailty Risk Score based on ICD-10 codes that characterised this group.\n\n Third, in separate cohorts, we tested how well the score predicted adverse outcomes and whether it identified similar groups as other frailty tools.\n\n\nFindings\nIn the development cohort (n=22?139), older people with frailty diagnoses formed a distinct group and had higher non-elective hospital use (33·6 bed-days over 2 years compared with 23·0 bed-days for the group with the next highest number of bed-days).\n\n In the national validation cohort (n=1?013?590), compared with the 429?762 (42·4%) patients with the lowest risk scores, the 202?718 (20·0%) patients with the highest Hospital Frailty Risk Scores had increased odds of 30-day mortality (odds ratio 1·71, 95% CI 1·68–1·75), long hospital stay (6·03, 5·92–6·10), and 30-day readmission (1·48, 1·46–1·50).\n\n The c statistics (ie, model discrimination) between individuals for these three outcomes were 0·60, 0·68, and 0·56, respectively.\n\n The Hospital Frailty Risk Score showed fair overlap with dichotomised Fried and Rockwood scales (kappa scores 0·22, 95% CI 0·15–0·30 and 0·30, 0·22–0·38, respectively) and moderate agreement with the Rockwood Frailty Index (Pearson's correlation coefficient 0·41, 95% CI 0·38–0·47).\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe Hospital Frailty Risk Score provides hospitals and health systems with a low-cost, systematic way to screen for frailty and identify a group of patients who are at greater risk of adverse outcomes and for whom a frailty-attuned approach might be useful.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Institute for Health

United States Community Practice: Findings From the ORBIT?AF Registry","abstract":"Background\nThe prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) continues to increase; however, there are limited data describing the division of care among practitioners in the community and whether care differs depending on provider specialty.\n\n\nMethods and Results\nUsing the Outcomes Registry for Better Informed Treatment of AF (ORBIT?AF) Registry, we described patient characteristics and AF management strategies in ambulatory clinic practice settings, including electrophysiology (EP), general cardiology, and primary care.\n\n A total of 10 097 patients were included; of these, 1544 (15.3%) were cared for by an EP provider, 6584 (65.2%) by a cardiology provider, and 1969 (19.5%) by an internal medicine/primary care provider.\n\n Compared with those patients who were cared for by cardiologists or internal medicine/primary care providers, patients cared for by EP providers were younger (median age, 73 years [interquartile range, IQR, 64, 80 years, Q1, Q3] versus 75 years [IQR, 67, 82 years] for cardiology and versus 76 years [IQR, 68, 82 years] for primary care).\n\n Compared with cardiology and internal medicine/primary care providers, EP providers used rhythm control (versus rate control) management more often (44.2% versus 29.7% and 28.8%, respectively, P&lt;0.0001; adjusted odds ratio [OR] EP versus cardiology, 1.66 [95% confidence interval, CI, 1.05 to 2.61]; adjusted OR for internal medicine/primary care versus cardiology, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.65 to 1.26]).\n\n Use of oral anticoagulant therapy was high across all providers, although it was higher for cardiology and EP providers (overall, 76.1%; P=0.02 for difference between groups).\n\n\nConclusions\nOur data demonstrate important differences between provider specialties, the demographics of the AF patient population treated, and treatment strategies—particularly for rhythm control and anticoagulation

Concerns arose about possible interactions between renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors and SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and virulence. An opposite hypothesis suggests that SARS-CoV-2 down-regulates ACE2 expression after cell entry, increasing RAAS activation and angiotensin II levels. Early evidence suggested that angiotensin II serum levels are increased in COVID-19 patients, and directly correlated with viral load and lung injury, while large observational studies did not detect harmful associations between ACEi/ARB therapy and the likelihood of COVID-19 or in-hospital mortality. However, no evidence is available on the effect on mortality of ACEi/ARB continuation or discontinuation in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.\nConsecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to Humanitas Clinical and Research Hospital (Rozzano-Milan, Lombardy, Italy) up to 1 April 2020 were enrolled in a prospective registry, which complies with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by our institutional Ethics Committee.\nDiscontinuation was defined as ACEi/ARB interruption at the time of hospital admission in patients known to be taking ACEis/ARBs at home. Patients suspending ACEis/ARBs during hospitalization for clinical reasons (e.g. hypotension, worsening renal function, etc.) were considered as the ACEi/ARB continuation group. The primary outcome was mortality. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated with binary logistic regression. Clinical follow-up was censored at the date of death or discharge. ORs for mortality were adjusted with multivariable logistic backward regression analysis. The following covariates were included in the model (only vital parameters and laboratory values obtained within 24 h since hospital admission were included): age &gt;75 years, body mass index &gt;30 kg/m2, body temperature &gt;37.5 C, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;60 mL/min/m2, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;50%, malignancy, heart rate &gt;100 b.p.m., respiratory rate &gt;20 breaths/min, cardiac involvement [high sensitivity troponin I (hs-TnI &gt;=19.6 ng/L) and brain natriuretic protein (BNP) &gt;=100 pg/mL], C-reactive protein, white blood cells &gt;10 000/mm3, and D-dimer (per 1 unit increase, ng/mL).\nA total of 397 patients with COVID-19 were included; 14.1% continued ACEi/ARB therapy, 29.5% discontinued ACEis/ARBs at time of hospitalization, and 56.4% did not take these drugs at home.\nMortality rates were 12.5% in the continuation group, 27.4% in the discontinuation group, and 17.4% in patients not taking ACEis/ARBs at home (P = 0.036). Cumulative event rates for mortality are displayed in Figure 1A. Crude and adjusted mortality risk estimates according to ACEi/ARB therapy are displayed in Figure 1B. Risk of mortality was significantly reduced in patients who continued ACEis/ARBs as compared with those who discontinued, those not taking ACEi/ARB therapy, and both these groups pooled. Changes in blood pressure values during hospitalization were similar between groups (Figure 1C). \nImpact of ACEi/ARB therapy on mortality. (A) Kaplan-Meier curves for mortality, stratified by ACEi/ARB therapy; (B) risk of mortality stratified by ACEi/ARB therapy; (C) box plots of blood pressure changes during hospitalization, stratified by ACEi/ARB therapy.\nThis is the first study investigating continuation and discontinuation of ACEis/ARBs in COVID-19 patients. Our findings can be summarized as follows: (i) 44% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients are on ACEi/ARB therapy at hospital hospitalization; (ii) approximately two-thirds of these patients discontinued ACEis/ARBs at hospital admission; and (iii) ACEi/ARB continuation during hospitalization was shown to be protective against mortality.\nDue to hypothetical safety concerns, prior to any recommendations from scientific societies, some front-line physicians switched patients from ACEis/ARBs to other antihypertensive drugs.\nA large case-control study has shown improved survival in COVID-19 patients taking ACEis. However, there are no data evaluating the prognostic role of ACEi/ARB continuation/discontinuation in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. By showing a significantly lower risk of mortality in the continuation group after adjustment for several covariates, our findings support continuation of ACEi/ARB therapy during COVID-19 hospitalization.\nPotential mechanisms of an ACEi/ARB-mediated protective effect include reduced severity of COVID-19 pneumonia, preserved hypoxic vasoconstriction, limited deterioration of renal function, and protection against myocardial injury. Moreover, ACEi/ARB discontinuation may lead to decompensations of pre-existing chronic heart failure and blood pressure instability. However, we did not observe a significant difference in changes of blood pressure values between groups during hospitalization.\nOur study has some limitations. First, we are unaware of the reasons leading to ACEi/ARB discontinuation. However, this would not have changed our findings. Moreover, despite some significant differences in comorbidities and vital parameters between groups, covariate adjustment strengthened the results observed at unadjusted comparisons. Finally, the observational nature of our registry does not prove a causal relationship between ACEi/ARB continuation and reduced mortality. Nevertheless, our findings add urgently needed evidence in support of in-hospital ACEi/ARB continuation in COVID-19 patients.\nIn conclusion, COVID-19 patients who continue ACEis/ARBs have a lower risk of mortality compared with those discontinuing ACEis/ARBs at the time of hospitalization or not takiing these drugs at home, suggesting that ACEis/ARBs could have a therapeutic role in COVID-19 patients. Our findings support recommendations of cardiovascular societies of not suspending ACEis/ARBs in COVID-19 patients.\n Conflict of interest: none declared.\nReferences\nRenin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors in patients with Covid-19\nCOVID-19 and the cardiovascular system\nClinical and biochemical indexes from 2019-nCoV infected patients linked to viral loads and lung injury\nRenin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockers and the risk of Covid-19\nCardiovascular disease, drug therapy, and mortality in Covid-19\n https://www.escardio.org/Councils/Council-on-Hypertension-(CHT)/News/position-statement-of-the-esc-council-on-hypertension-on-ace-inhibitors-and-ang (13 May 2020).\n","References depth 1":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors in patients with Covid-19","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"10.1038/s41586-020-2012-7","date":"2020-01-29","title":"A pneumonia outbreak associated with a new coronavirus of probable bat origin","abstract":"id='Par1'>Since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 18 years ago, a large number of SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoVs) have been discovered in their natural reservoir host, bats1–4.\n Previous studies have shown that some bat SARSr-CoVs have the potential to infect humans5–7.\n Here we report the identification and characterization of a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which caused an epidemic of acute respiratory syndrome in humans in Wuhan, China.\n The epidemic, which started on 12 December 2019, had caused 2,794 laboratory-confirmed infections including 80 deaths by 26 January 2020.

By extracting and analyzing all available published clinical data, we identified several major clinical characteristics associated with increased disease severity and mortality among patients with COVID-19. Specifically, preexisting chronic conditions such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes are strongly associated with an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19; surprisingly, however, we found no correlation between chronic liver disease and increased disease severity.\n In addition, we found that both acute cardiac injury and acute kidney injury are highly correlated with an increased risk of COVID-19-related mortality.\n Given the high risk of comorbidity and the high mortality rate associated with tissue damage, organ function should be monitored closely in patients diagnosed with COVID-19, and this approach should be included when establishing new guidelines for managing these high-risk patients.\n Moreover, additional clinical data are needed in order to determine whether a supportive therapy can help mitigate the development of severe, potentially fatal complications, and further studies are needed to identify the pathophysiology and the mechanism underlying this novel coronavirus-associated infectious disease.\n Taken together, these findings provide new insights regarding clinical strategies for improving the management and outcome of patients with COVID-19.","id":"PMC7187729","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"AAAS","authors":[{"firstname":"Xinhui","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuexian","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuexian","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhaoxian","surname":"Cai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhaoxian","surname":"Cai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaotian","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaotong","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaotong","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Junxia","surname":"Min","email":"junxiamin@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Junxia","surname":"Min","email":"junxiamin@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fudi","surname":"Wang","email":"fwang@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fudi","surname":"Wang","email":"fwang@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2002032","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China","abstract":"Background\nSince December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020.

severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was confirmed between February 21 and March 11, 2020, were matched to 30,759 beneficiaries of the Regional Health Service (controls) according to sex, age, and municipality of residence.\n\n Information about the use of selected drugs and patients’ clinical profiles was obtained from regional databases of health care use.\n\n Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for associations between drugs and infection, with adjustment for confounders, were estimated by means of logistic regression.\n\n\nResults\nAmong both case

inhibitors might influence the severity of COVID-19. We aimed to evaluate whether continuing versus discontinuing renin–angiotensin system inhibitors (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers) affects outcomes in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19.\nMethods\nThe REPLACE COVID trial was a prospective, randomised, open-label trial done at 20 large referral hospitals in seven countries worldwide.\n\n Eligible participants were aged 18 years and older who were admitted to hospital with COVID-19 and were receiving a renin–angiotensin system inhibitor before admission.\n\n Individuals with contraindications to continuation or discontinuation of renin–angiotensin system inhibitor therapy were excluded.\n\n Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to continuation or discontinuation of their renin–angiotensin system inhibitor using permuted block randomisation, with allocation concealed using a secure web-based randomisation system.\n\n The primary outcome was a global rank score in which participants were ranked across four hierarchical tiers incorporating time to death, duration of mechanical ventilation, time on renal replacement or vasopressor therapy, and multiorgan dysfunction during the hospitalisation.\n\n Primary analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population.\n\n The REPLACE COVID trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.\n\ngov, NCT04338009.\n\n\nFindings\nBetween March 31 and Aug 20, 2020, 152 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to either continue or discontinue renin–angiotensin system inhibitor therapy (continuation group n=75; discontinuation group n=77).\n\n Mean age of participants was 62 years (SD 12), 68 (45%) were female, mean body-mass index was 33 kg/m2 (SD 8), and 79 (52%) had diabetes.\n\n Compared with discontinuation of renin–angiotensin system inhibitors, continuation had no effect on the global rank score (median rank 73 [IQR 40–110] for continuation vs 81 [38–117] for discontinuation; ?-coefficient 8 [95% CI ?13 to 29]).\n\n There were 16 (21%) of 75 participants in the continuation arm versus 14 (18%) of 77 in the discontinuation arm who required intensive care unit admission or invasive mechanical ventilation, and 11 (15%) of 75 participants in the continuation group versus ten (13%) of 77 in the discontinuation group died.\n\n 29 (39%) participants in the continuation group and 28 (36%) participants in the discontinuation group had at least one adverse event (?2 test of adverse events between treatment groups p=0·77).\n\n There was no difference in blood pressure, serum potassium, or creatinine during follow-up across the two groups.\n\n\nInterpretation\nConsistent with international society recommendations, renin–angiotensin system inhibitors can be safely continued in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19.\nFunding\nREPLACE COVID Investigators, REPLACE COVID Trial Social Fundraising Campaign, and

inhibitors in COVID-19 (ACEI-COVID): a prospective, parallel group, randomised, controlled, open-label trial","abstract":"Background\nSARS-CoV-2 entry in human cells depends on angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, which can be upregulated by inhibitors of the renin–angiotensin system (RAS).\n\n We aimed to test our hypothesis that discontinuation of chronic treatment with ACE-inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) mitigates the course o\f recent-onset COVID-19.\nMethods\nACEI-COVID was a parallel group, randomised, controlled, open-label trial done at 35 centres in Austria and Germany.\n\n Patients aged 18 years and older were enrolled if they presented with recent symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and were chronically treated with ACEIs or ARBs.\n\n Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to discontinuation or continuation of RAS inhibition for 30 days.\n\n Primary outcome was the maximum sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score within 30 days, where death was scored with the maximum achievable SOFA score.\n\n Secondary endpoints were area under the death-adjusted SOFA score (AUCSOFA), mean SOFA score, admission to the intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, and death.\n\n Analyses were done on a modified intention-to-treat basis.\n\n This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.\n\ngov, NCT04353596.\n\n\nFindings\nBetween April 20, 2020, and Jan 20, 2021, 204 patients (median age 75 years [IQR 66–80], 37% females) were randomly assigned to discontinue (n=104) or continue (n=100) RAS inhibition.\n\n Within 30 days, eight (8%) of 104 died in the discontinuation group and 12 (12%) of 100 patients died in the continuation group (p=0·42).\n\n There was no significant difference in the primary endpoint between the discontinuation and continuation group (median [IQR] maximum SOFA score 0·00 (0·00–2·00) vs 1·00 (0·00–3·00); p=0·12).\n\n Discontinuation was associated with a significantly lower AUCSOFA (0·00 [0·00–9·25] vs 3·50 [0·00–23·50]; p=0·040), mean SOFA score (0·00 [0·00–0·31] vs 0·12 [0·00–0·78]; p=0·040), and 30-day SOFA score (0·00 [10–90th percentile, 0·00–1·20] vs 0·00 [0·00–24·00]; p=0·023).\n\n At 30 days, 11 (11%) in the discontinuation group and 23 (23%) in the continuation group had signs of organ dysfunction (SOFA score ?1) or were dead (p=0·017).\n\n There were no significant differences for mechanical ventilation (10 (10%) vs 8 (8%), p=0·87) and admission to intensive care unit (20 [19%] vs 18 [18%], p=0·96) between the discontinuation and continuation group.\n\n\nInterpretation\nDiscontinuation of RAS-inhibition in COVID-19 had no significant effect on the maximum severity of COVID-19 but may lead to a faster and better recovery.\n\n The decision to continue or discontinue should be made on an individual basis, considering the risk profile, the indication for RAS inhibition, and the availability of alternative therapies and outpatient monitoring options.\n\n\nFunding\nAustrian Science Fund and German Center for Cardiovascular Research.\n\n\n","id":"PMC8195495","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

(COVID-19) pandemic.\n Strikingly, men account for the majority of COVID-19 deaths, with current figures ranging from 59% to 75% of total mortality.\n However, despite clear implications in relation to COVID-19 mortality, most research has not considered sex as a critical factor in data analysis.\n Here, we highlight fundamental biological differences that exist between males and females, and how these may make significant contributions to the male-biased COVID-19 mortality.\n We present preclinical evidence identifying the influence of biological sex on the expression and regulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the main receptor used by SARS-CoV-2 to enter cells.\n However, we note that there is a lack of reports showing that sexual dimorphism of ACE2 expression exists and is of functional relevance in humans.\n In contrast, there is strong evidence, especially in the context of viral infections, that sexual dimorphism plays a central role in the genetic and hormonal regulation of immune responses, both of the innate and the adaptive immune system.\n We review evidence supporting that ineffective anti-SARS-CoV-2 responses, coupled with a predisposition for inappropriate hyperinflammatory responses, could provide a biological explanation for the male bias in COVID-19 mortality.\n A prominent finding in COVID-19 is the increased risk of death with pre-existing cardiovascular comorbidities, such as hypertension, obesity, and age.\n We contextualize how important features of sexual dimorphism and inflammation in COVID-19 may exhibit a reciprocal relationship with comorbidities, and explain their increased mortality risk.\n Ultimately, we demonstrate that biological sex is a fundamental variable of critical relevance to our mechanistic understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the pursuit of effective COVID-19 preventative and therapeutic strategies.\n","id":"PMC7665363","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Oxford University Press","authors":[{"firstname":"Laura

decided to perform a new meta-analysis of the observational studies that explored the relationship between pre-existing hypertension and mortality risk in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, using more stringent inclusion criteria to overcome the limitations inherent previous meta-analyses.\n\n\nMethods\nA systematic search of the on-line databases available up to 31 March 2022 was conducted, including peer-reviewed original articles, involving the adult population, where the role of hypertension on mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 infection was determined by Cox-proportional hazard models.\n\n

(ACE2) is a type I integral membrane that exists in two forms: the first is a transmembrane protein; the second is a soluble catalytic ectodomain of ACE2. The catalytic ectodomain of ACE2 undergoes shedding by a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 17 (ADAM17), in which calmodulin mediates the calcium signaling pathway that is involved in ACE2 release, resulting in a soluble catalytic ectodomain of ACE2 that can be measured as soluble ACE2 plasma activity.\n The shedding of the ACE2 catalytic ectodomain plays a role in cardiac remodeling and endothelial dysfunction and is a predictor of all-cause mortality, including cardiovascular mortality.\n Moreover, considerable evidence supports that the ACE2 catalytic ectodomain is an essential entry receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.\n Additionally, endotoxins and the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1? and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF?) all enhanced soluble catalytic ectodomain ACE2 shedding from the airway epithelia, suggesting that the shedding of ACE2 may represent a mechanism by which viral entry and infection may be controlled such as some types of betacoronavirus.\n In this regard, ACE2 plays an important role in inflammation and thrombotic response, and its down-regulation may aggravate COVID-19 via the renin-angiotensin system, including by promoting pathological changes in lung injury.\n Soluble forms of ACE2 have recently been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n Furthermore, given that vitamin D enhanced the shedding of ACE2, some studies reported that vitamin D treatment is associated with prognosis improvement in COVID-19.

receptor.\n ACE2 is widely expressed, including, in the lungs, cardiovascular system, gut, kidneys, central nervous system, and adipose tissue.\n ACE2 has recently been identified as the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, the infective agent responsible for coronavirus disease 2019, providing a critical link between immunity, inflammation, ACE2, and cardiovascular disease.\n Although sharing a close

Harnessing the expertise of the biomedical and clinical communities is imperative to expand the available therapeutics beyond anticoagulants and to target both thrombocytopathy and endotheliopathy.\n Only with such collaborative efforts can we better prepare for further waves and for future coronavirus-related pandemics.\n","id":"PMC7675396","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing Group UK","authors":[{"firstname":"Sean X.","surname":"Gu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tarun","surname":"Tyagi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kanika","surname":"Jain","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Vivian W.","surname":"Gu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Seung Hee","surname":"Lee","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jonathan M.","surname":"Hwa","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jennifer M.","surname":"Kwan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Diane S.","surname":"Krause","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Alfred I.","surname":"Lee","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Stephanie","surname":"Halene","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kathleen A.","surname":"Martin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hyung J.","surname":"Chun","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"John","surname":"Hwa","email":"john.hwa@yale.edu","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"John","surname":"Hwa","email":"john.hwa@yale.edu","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.ijlp.2020.101594","date":"2020-05-29","title":"Domestic violence against women and the COVID-19 pandemic: What is the role of psychiatry?","abstract":"A heightened risk of domestic violence has been associated with infection-reducing measures undertaken by governments during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n Psychiatric services can play a key role in addressing this issue by (a) addressing certain risk factors for perpetration of domestic violence through, for example, assertive identification and management of substance misuse; (b) providing support, advocacy and treatment services for victims of domestic violence; and (c) multi-agency working to strengthen medical and social responses to domestic violence.\n At a time like this, it is important that multi-disciplinary mental health services are strengthened, rather than depleted, in order to address the pressing issues at hand.\n","id":"PMC7264022","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"The Authors.

currently.\n Previous studies in hospitalized COVID-19 patients have been limited by sample size.\n Methods: The National Inpatient Sample database which is the largest inpatient database in the US was queried in the year 2020 for the diagnosis of COVID-19 based on ICD-10-CM U07.1 and associated outcomes.\n Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors of mortality.\n STATA 16.0 was used for statistical analysis.\n Results: A weighted total of 1,678,995 hospitalizations for COVID-19 were identified.\n Median age of admitted patients with COVID-19 was 65 year (51-77) with 47.9% female and 49.2% White.\n Majority of the patients admitted were &gt;65 years of age (49.3%).\n Hypertension and diabetes were the most common comorbidities (64.2% and 39.5%, respectively).\n Overall inpatient mortality was 13.2% and increasing to 55.9% in patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n Trend of inpatient mortality was significantly decreasing over the year.\n Predictors of inpatient mortality included age, male sex, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, heart failure, arrythmia, obesity, and coagulopathy.\n Despite a lower proportion of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, Black, Hispanic, and Native Americans were at an increased adjusted odds of inpatient mortality.\n Disparity was also noted in income, with low median household income associated with higher risk of mortality.\n Conclusion: In the largest US cohort with &gt;1.6 million hospitalized COVID-19 patients in 2020, overall inpatient mortality was 13.6% with significantly higher mortality in ventilated patients.\n Significant socioeconomic and racial disparities were present with minorities at higher odds of

syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), remains a global health burden.\n Obesity, a metabolic syndrome affecting one-third of the population, has proven to be a major risk factor for COVID-19 severe complications.\n Several studies have identified metabolic signatures and disrupted metabolic pathways associated with COVID-19, however there are no reports evaluating the role of obesity in the COVID-19 metabolic regulation.\n In this study we highlight the involvement of obesity metabolically in affecting SARS-CoV-2 infection and the consequent health complications, mainly cardiovascular disease.\n We measured one hundred and forty-four (144) metabolites using ultra high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF-MS) to identify metabolic changes in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, in lean and obese COVID-19 positive (n=82) and COVID-19 negative (n=24) patients.\n The identified metabolites are found to be mainly correlating with glucose, energy and steroid metabolisms.\n Further data analysis indicated twelve (12) significantly yet differentially abundant metabolites associated with viral infection and health complications, in COVID-19 obese patients.\n Two of the detected metabolites, n6-acetyl-l-lysine and p-cresol, are detected only among the COVID-19 cohort, exhibiting significantly higher levels in COVID-19 obese patients when compared to COVID-19 lean patients.\n These metabolites have important roles in viral entry and could explain the increased susceptibility of obese patients.\n On the same note, a set of six metabolites associated with antiviral and anti-inflammatory functions displayed significantly lower abundance in COVID-19 obese patients.\n In conclusion, this report highlights the plasma metabolome of COVID-19 obese patients as a metabolic feature and signature to help improve clinical outcomes.\n We propose n6-acetyl-l-lysine and p-cresol as potential metabolic markers which warrant further investigations to better understand their involvement in different metabolic pathways in COVID-19.","id":"PMC9161728","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Frontiers Media

Protein Complex Formation Increases the Risk of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein-Induced Cardiomyocyte Dysfunction through ACE2 Upregulation","abstract":"Myocardial damage caused by the newly emerged coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection is one of the key determinants of COVID-19 severity and mortality.\n SARS-CoV-2 entry to host cells is initiated by binding with its receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2, and the ACE2 abundance is thought to reflect the susceptibility to infection.\n Here, we report that ibudilast, which we previously identified as a potent inhibitor of protein complex between transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) 3 and NADPH oxidase (Nox) 2, attenuates the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein pseudovirus-evoked contractile and metabolic dysfunctions of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs).\n Epidemiologically reported risk factors of severe COVID-19, including cigarette sidestream smoke (CSS) and anti-cancer drug treatment, commonly upregulate ACE2 expression level, and these were suppressed by inhibiting TRPC3-Nox2 complex formation.\n Exposure of NRCMs to SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, as well as CSS and doxorubicin (Dox), induces ATP release through pannexin-1 hemi-channels, and this ATP release potentiates pseudovirus entry to NRCMs and human iPS cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPS-CMs).\n As the pseudovirus entry followed by production of reactive oxygen species was attenuated by inhibiting TRPC3-Nox2 complex in hiPS-CMs, we suggest that TRPC3-Nox2 complex formation triggered by panexin1-mediated ATP release participates in exacerbation of myocardial damage by amplifying ACE2-dependent SARS-CoV-2

found in arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells in many vascular beds.\n Among the best characterized functions of ACE2 is its role in regulating vascular tone.\n ACE2 through its effector peptide Ang-(1-7) and receptor Mas1 induces vasodilation and attenuates Ang II-induced vasoconstriction.\n In endothelial cells activation of the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas1 axis increases production of the vasodilator’s nitric oxide and prostacyclin’s and in vascular smooth muscle cells it inhibits pro-contractile and pro-inflammatory signaling.\n Endothelial ACE2 is cleaved by proteases, shed into the circulation and measured as soluble ACE2. Plasma ACE2 activity is increased in cardiovascular disease and may have prognostic significance in disease severity.\n In addition to its enzymatic function, ACE2 is the receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus (CoV) and SARS-Cov-2, which cause SARS and coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) respectively.\n ACE-2 is thus a double-edged sword: it promotes cardiovascular health while also facilitating the devastations caused by coronaviruses.\n COVID-19 is associated with cardiovascular disease as a risk factor and as a complication.\n Mechanisms linking COVID-19 and cardiovascular disease are unclear, but vascular ACE2 may be important.\n This review focuses on the vascular biology and (patho)physiology of ACE2 in cardiovascular health and disease and briefly discusses the role of vascular ACE2 as a potential mediator of vascular injury in COVID-19.","id":"PMC7846970","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Portland Press Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Jithin","surname":"Kuriakose","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Augusto C.","surname":"Montezano","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rhian M.","surname":"Touyz","email":"rhian.touyz@glasgow.ac.uk","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1074/jbc.M505111200","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Tumor Necrosis Factor-?

onset, or alters their progression.\n ApoE4 likely causes neurodegeneration secondary to its abnormal structure, caused by an interaction between its carboxyl- and amino-terminal domains, called domain interaction.\n When neurons are stressed or injured, they synthesize apoE to redistribute cholesterol for neuronal repair or remodeling.\n However, because of its altered structure, neuronal apoE4 undergoes neuron-specific proteolysis, generating neurotoxic fragments (12–29 kDa) that escape the secretory pathway and cause mitochondrial dysfunction and cytoskeletal alterations, including tau phosphorylation.\n ApoE4-associated pathology can be prevented by small-molecule structure correctors that block domain interaction by converting apoE4 to a molecule that resembles apoE3 both structurally and functionally.\n Structure correctors are a potential therapeutic approach to reduce apoE4 pathology in both cardiovascular and neurological disorders.\n","id":"PMC4921111","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","authors":[{"firstname":"Robert

screened to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in endothelial activation.\n It was found that nucleocapsid protein (NP) of SARS-CoV-2 significantly activated human endothelial cells through Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)/NF-?B and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways.\n Moreover, by screening a natural microbial compound library containing 154 natural compounds,

fatal complications of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.\n Indeed, from early on during the SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic it was recognized that cardiac complications may occur, even in patients with no underlying cardiac disorders, as part of the acute infection, and that these were associated with more severe disease and increased morbidity and mortality.\n The most common cardiac complication is acute cardiac injury, defined by significant elevation of cardiac troponins.\n The potential mechanisms of cardiovascular complications include direct viral myocardial injury, systemic inflammation induced by the virus, sepsis, arrhythmia, myocardial oxygen supply-demand mismatch, electrolyte abnormalities, and hypercoagulability.\n This review is focused on the prevalence, risk factors and clinical course of COVID-19-related myocardial injury, as well as on current data with regard to disease pathogenesis, specifically the interaction of platelets with the vascular endothelium.\n The latter section includes consideration of the role of SARS-CoV-2 proteins in triggering development of a generalized endotheliitis that, in turn, drives intense activation of platelets.\n Most prominently, SARS-CoV-2–induced endotheliitis involves interaction of the viral spike protein with endothelial angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) together with alternative mechanisms that involve the nucleocapsid and viroporin.\n In addition, the mechanisms by which activated platelets intensify endothelial activation and dysfunction, seemingly driven by release of the platelet-derived calcium-binding proteins, SA100A8 and SA100A9, are described.\n These events create a SARS-CoV-2–driven cycle of intravascular inflammation and coagulation, which contributes significantly to a poor clinical outcome in patients with severe disease.\n","id":"PMC8854752","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Frontiers Media

lungs from a human ACE2 transgenic mouse infected with SARS-CoV-2 compared to the control infected with mock; human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived liver organoids infected with SARS-CoV-2; adipose tissues from a mouse model of COVID-19 overexpressing human ACE2 via adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) compared to the control GFP after SARS-CoV-2 infection;

ACE2 receptors are ubiquitous and widely expressed in the heart, vessels, gut, lung (particularly in type 2 pneumocytes and macrophages), kidney, testis and brain.\n ACE2 is mostly bound to cell membranes and only scarcely present in the circulation in a soluble form.\n An important salutary function of membrane-bound and soluble ACE2 is the degradation of angiotensin II to angiotensin1-7.\n Consequently, ACE2 receptors limit several detrimental effects resulting from binding of angiotensin II to AT1 receptors, which include vasoconstriction, enhanced inflammation and thrombosis.\n The increased generation of angiotensin1-7 also triggers counter-regulatory protective effects through binding to G-protein coupled Mas receptors.\n Unfortunately, the entry of SARS-CoV2 into the cells through membrane fusion markedly down-regulates ACE2 receptors, with loss of the catalytic effect of these receptors at the external site of the membrane.\n Increased pulmonary inflammation and coagulation have been reported as unwanted effects of enhanced and unopposed angiotensin II effects via the ACE?Angiotensin II?AT1 receptor axis.\n Clinical reports of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 show that several features associated with infection and severity of the disease (i.\ne.\n, older age, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease) share a variable degree of ACE2 deficiency.\n We suggest that ACE2 down-regulation induced by viral invasion may be especially detrimental in people with baseline ACE2 deficiency associated with the above conditions.\n The additional ACE2 deficiency after viral invasion might amplify the dysregulation between the ‘adverse’ ACE?Angiotensin II?AT1 receptor axis and the ‘protective’ ACE2?Angiotensin1-7?Mas receptor axis.\n In the lungs, such dysregulation would favor the progression of inflammatory and thrombotic processes triggered by local angiotensin II hyperactivity unopposed by angiotensin1-7.\n In this setting, recombinant ACE2, angiotensin1-7 and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers could be promising therapeutic approaches in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n","id":"PMC7167588","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"European Federation of Internal Medicine.

38°C) was the most common symptom (98%) and the earliest.\n\n When admitted to the isolation unit of the hospital for observation, most patients reported nonspecific symptoms associated with their fever.\n\n Only two patients with preexisting illnesses had cough on the same day the fever began.\n\n Eventually, 39 patients (74%) developed cough, beginning at a mean (± SD) time of 4.5 ± 1.9 days after fever onset, and 35 patients (66%) had diarrhea beginning at a mean time of 6.0 ± 3.3 days after fever onset.\n\n Thirty-one patients (59%) had abnormal findings on chest radiographs on hospital admission, and all but 1 patient (98%) eventually developed lung infiltrates that were consistent with pneumonia.\n\n The majority of patients (63%) first developed unifocal infiltrates at a mean time of 4.5 ± 2.1 days after fever onset, while in 37% of patients the initial infiltrates were multifocal, appearing at a mean time of 5.8 ± 1.3 days after fever onset.\n\n Common laboratory findings included lymphopenia (on hospital admission, 70%;

It has since spread rapidly throughout most of the world and become a global public health crisis. As of April 24, 2020, there have been more than 2.5 million confirmed cases and 160,000 deaths, and these numbers are continuing to rise.\nCOVID-19 is a highly infectious disease spread via human-to-human transmission, including through droplets, direct contact, and ocular tissues. Each patient can spread the virus to two to three new people. SARS-CoV-2-infected patients are infectious even during the asymptomatic stage, which differs from SARS-CoV. Although the majority of patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 have mild symptoms, the viruses can cause severe lung pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiple organ failure, and death.\nPeople with mild cases may only require early isolation and close follow-up. For more severe cases, aggressive treatment and intensive care may be urgently needed. To date, the largest case series study enrolled 1591 COVID-19 patients who required ICU admission in Italy. However, the majority (58%) of patients remained in the hospital, and there was no extra description of their medical therapy. In severe cases, the disease progressed quickly while data guiding management remains limited and scarce. In China, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University was a designated treatment hospital for patients with COVID-19. In this study, we recruited 681 people with confirmed, severe cases of COVID-19 with a clear endpoint (death or discharge) to clarify their epidemiological, clinical, and therapeutic features.\nMethods\nStudy population\nThis retrospective, cohort study included 681 adult patients (&gt;=18 years old) with COVID-19 who were admitted to the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University in Wuhan, China, from January 3, 2020, to April 9, 2020. Patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 according to the guidelines issued by the China National Health Commission. All enrolled individuals met at least one of the following criteria: (1) symptoms of respiratory distress, with a respiratory rate &gt;=30 times/min; (2) a resting state blood oxygen saturation of &lt;=93%; (3) an oxygenation index (PaO2/FiO2) of &lt;=300 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa); or (4) lung imaging showing more than 50% of lesions progressing within 24-48 h. The Research Ethics Commission of Qilu Hospital of Shandong University and Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University approved this protocol.\nData collection\nThe primary outcomes were all-cause mortality during hospitalization and discharge. The outcomes were used to divide participants into two groups: survivors and non-survivors. Two physicians reviewed the electronic medical records and extracted the epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment, and outcome data of all patients. All data were confirmed by a third researcher. Neutrophil-To-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR) was calculated as absolute neutrophil counts divided by absolute lymphocyte counts. Acute myocardial injury was diagnosed if serum levels of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) were above the upper limit of the reference range (&gt;0.04 ng/ml).\nStatistical analysis\nAll statistical analysis was performed using SPSS Statistics 26.0 (IBM Corp.) and MedCalc (MedCalc Software bvba, Ostend, Belgium). Data are presented as median (IQR) for continuous variables and n (%) for categorical variables. A Mann-Whitney U test, chi-square test, or Fisher's exact test were used to compare the differences between survivors and non-survivors. A P value of &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression models to explore the risk factors associated with outcomes. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the parameters. A crossover analysis was performed according to the research of D.W. Hosmer. To minimize bias by confounding, propensity score (PS) matching (1:2 match, caliper 0.2) was used to adjust for imbalances of clinically-relevant parameters that differed between the two groups. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to determine the survival probability.\nResults\nCharacteristics and laboratory findings of patients\nDemographic, clinical, and laboratory findings of patients with COVID-19.\nTable 1	 	\n	Total patients (n = 681)	Survivors (n = 577)	Non-survivors (n = 104)	P value	 	Age (years)	65.0 (54.0-72.0)	63.0 (52.0-70.0)	72.5 (65.0-80.8)	0.000	 	 &lt;40 years old	46 (6.8%)	43 (7.5%)	3 (2.9%)	0.088	 	 40-65 years old	314 (46.1%)	289 (50.1%)	25 (24.0%)	0.000	 	 &gt;65 years old	321 (47.1%)	245 (42.5%)	76 (73.1%)	0.000	 	 :  : 	 	Gender	 	 Male	362 (53.2%)	297 (51.5%)	65 (62.5%)	0.038	 	 Female	319 (46.8%)	280 (48.5%)	39 (37.5%)		 	 Smoking	29 (4.3%)	26 (4.5%)	3 (3.1%)	0.706	 	 :  : 	 	Signs and symptoms	 	 Fever	584 (85.9%)	494 (85.8%)	90 (86.5%)	0.835	 	 Dry cough	462 (67.8%)	397 (68.8%)	65 (62.5%)	0.205	 	 Fatigue	352 (51.9%)	299 (52.1%)	53 (51.0%)	0.832	 	 Dyspnea	123 (18.1%)	95 (16.5%)	28 (26.9%)	0.011	 	 Diarrhea	119 (17.5%)	104 (18.1%)	15 (14.4%)	0.366	 	 Palpitation	17 (2.5%)	15 (2.6%)	2 (1.9%)	0.944	 	 :  : 	 	Comorbidity	 	 Hypertension	293 (43.0%)	227 (39.3%)	66 (63.5%)	0.000	 	 Diabetes	114 (16.7%)	96 (16.6%)	18 (17.3%)	0.866	 	 CAD	80 (11.7%)	55 (9.5%)	25 (24.0%)	0.000	 	 Cerebral infarction	33 (4.8%)	20 (3.5%)	13 (12.5%)	0.000	 	 CKD	27 (4.0%)	20 (3.5%)	7 (6.7%)	0.194	 	 COPD	15 (2.2%)	13 (2.3%)	2 (1.9%)	1.000	 	 :  : 	 	Laboratory findings	 	 White blood cells (109/L)	5.90 (4.39-7.94)	5.66 (4.27-7.39)	8.25 (5.60-12.45)	0.000	 	 Neutrophils (109/L)	4.17 (2.81-6.26)	3.83 (2.70-5.50)	7.36 (4.77-11.41)	0.000	 	 Lymphocytes (109/L)	0.97 (0.68-1.42)	1.05 (0.73-1.49)	0.56 (0.35-0.87)	0.000	 	 NLR	3.84 (2.29-8.24)	3.38 (2.14-6.33)	12.27 (7.73-24.50)	0.000	 	 Hemoglobin (g/L)	123.0 (112.0-134.0)	123.0 (112.5-134.0)	127.0 (108.5-138.0)	0.491	 	 Platelet (109/L)	214.0 (161.5-279.5)	222.0 (168.5-290.0)	173.0 (118.0-227.5)	0.000	 	 CRP (mg/L)	40.1 (7.4-82.3)	29.4 (5.0-68.6)	101.0 (59.1-180.7)	0.000	 	 IL-6 (pg/mL)	6.08 (1.89-20.00)	4.43 (1.50-15.33)	78.90 (26.47-118.28)	0.000	 	 ALT (U/L)	25.0 (17.0-45.5)	26.0 (16.0-46.0)	24.0 (18.0-42.0)	0.747	 	 AST (U/L)	30.0 (20.0-43.5)	28.0 (20.0-40.0)	41.0 (25.5-62.5)	0.000	 	 Creatinine (mumol/L)	61.0 (50.0-74.5)	60.0 (50.0-72.0)	73.0 (54.0-112.0)	0.000	 	 LDH (U/L)	286.0 (217.0-398.5)	273.0 (212.0-349.0)	477.0 (352.0-652.0)	0.000	 	 CK-MB (ng/mL)	1.09 (0.70-2.00)	0.99 (0.66-1.51)	3.27 (1.72-5.95)	0.000	 	 cTnI (ng/mL)	0.00 (0.00-0.03)	0.00 (0.00-0.01)	0.15 (0.03-0.78)	0.000	 	 Acute myocardial injury	139 (20.4%)	64 (11.1%)	75 (72.1%)	0.000	 	 BNP elevation	78 (13.6%)	38 (8.0%)	40 (42.1%)	0.000	 	 CD3 count (/muL)	558.0 (356.0-858.8)	611.0 (409.5-905.5)	287.0 (177.0-433.0)	0.000	 	 CD4 count (/muL)	349.5 (205.0-542.8)	387.0 (237.5-576.5)	172.0 (106.0-283.0)	0.000	 	 CD8 count (/muL)	200.0 (107.3-311.5)	209.0 (123.0-325.0)	77.0 (48.0-147.0)	0.000	 	\nData were presented as n (%) or median (IQR).\nP values are comparing Survivor and Non-survivor.

Hypertension (43.0%) was the most common comorbidity, followed by diabetes (16.7%) and coronary artery disease (CAD, 11.7%). The main clinical symptoms were fever (85.9%), dry cough (67.8%), and fatigue (51.9%).\nCompared with the survivors, non-survivors were older, more male, and had a higher heart rate and systolic blood pressure (SBP) (P &lt; .05). Non-survivors had higher hypertension, CAD, and cerebral infarction comorbidity rates (P &lt; .001), as well as significantly higher white blood cell and neutrophil counts and CRP, interleukin-6 (IL-6), NLR, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatinine, blood glucose, triglycerides (TG), LDH, creatine kinase-myocardial isoenzyme (CK-MB), and cTnI levels. Lymphocyte, platelet, CD3, CD4, CD8 counts and total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels were lower (P &lt; .05) in non-survivors. There were also more cases of acute myocardial injury (72.1% vs. 11.1%) and BNP elevation (42.1% vs. 8.0%) among non-survivors as compared to the survivors. There was no significant difference in diastolic blood pressure (DBP), aspartate aminotransferase (ALT), potassium, sodium, and hemoglobin between the two groups (Table 1, Supplementary Table1).\nInterventions and clinical outcomes\nInterventions of patients with COVID-19.\nTable 2	 	\n	Total patients (n = 681)	Survivors (n = 577)	Non-survivors (n = 104)	P value	 	Oxygen support	 	 Nasal cannula	476 (70.1%)	442 (76.9%)	34 (32.7%)	0.000	 	 Non-invasive ventilation	164 (24.2%)	125 (21.8%)	39 (37.5%)	0.001	 	 Invasive mechanical ventilation	38 (5.6%)	7 (1.2%)	31 (29.8%)	0.000	 	 :  : 	 	Treatment	 	 Antiviral therapy	666 (97.8%)	566 (98.1%)	100 (96.2%)	0.380	 	 Arbidol	571 (83.8%)	500 (86.7%)	71 (68.3%)	0.000	 	 Ribavirin	279 (41.0%)	245 (42.5%)	34 (32.7%)	0.060	 	 Ganciclovir	92 (13.5%)	72 (12.5%)	20 (19.2%)	0.064	 	 Oseltamivir	261 (38.4%)	218 (37.8%)	43(41.7%)	0.446	 	 IFN-alpha	119 (17.5%)	96 (16.6%)	23 (22.1%)	0.176	 	 Antibiotic therapy	571 (83.8%)	470 (81.5%)	101 (97.1%)	0.000	 	 Glucocorticoids	332 (48.8%)	266 (46.2%)	66 (63.5%)	0.001	 	 Immunoglobulin	372 (54.6%)	305 (52.9%)	67 (64.4%)	0.029	 	 Vitamin C	214 (31.4%)	175 (30.3%)	39 (37.5%)	0.147	 	 Antifungal drugs	19 (2.8%)	10 (1.7%)	9 (8.7%)	0.000	 	\nIFN-alpha, Interferon-alpha;\nOxygen support was administered to patients according to hypoxemia severity.

Compared with the survivors, non-survivors used more antibiotics, glucocorticoids, immunoglobulin, and antifungal drugs, while less arbidol was administered (P &lt; .05) (Table 2 ).\nIndependent predictors of death\nMultivariate analysis for predicting the risk of death in COVID-19 patients.\nTable 3	 	\nCharacteristics	Multivariate	 	OR (95%CI)	P	 	Age (years)	1.049 (1.019-1.080)	0.001	 	Acute myocardial injury	7.716 (3.812-15.619)	0.000	 	NLR	1.057 (1.010-1.107)	0.018	 	CRP (mg/L)	1.007 (1.001-1.013)	0.017	 	LDH (U/L)	1.003 (1.001-1.005)	0.002	 	CD3 count (/muL)	0.998 (0.996-0.999)	0.007	 	Arbidol	0.280 (0.126-0.625)	0.002	 	Ribavirin	0.477 (0.232-0.982)	0.044	 	\nWe performed a multivariable logistic regression to determine the parameters associated with death in patients with severe cases of COVID-19. We found that NLR (odds ratio (95% CI), 1.057 (1.010-1.107); P = .018) and acute myocardial injury (7.716 (3.812-15.619); P = .000) were independently and negatively associated with death in patients with severe COVID-19. The risk of death increases by 5.7% for every one-unit increase in NLR. In addition, age, CRP, LDH, CD3 counts, arbidol, and ribavirin were independently associated with adverse outcomes (Table 3 ).\nROC analysis of the association between NLR, Acute myocardial injury, and their combination effect in relation to death. A. The ROC curves of age, CRP, LDH, NLR, lymphocyte counts, and acute myocardial injury. B. The ROC curves of NLR, acute myocardial injury, and their combination.\nFig. 1\nROC analysis identified an NLR of 6.66 as the optimal cutoff to discriminate between discharge and death outcomes (area under the curve [AUC] [95% CI], 0.860 [0.821-0.898]; P &lt; .001; Youden's index is 0.611). The area under the ROC curve was the largest in NLR, followed by acute myocardial injury (0.805), CRP (0.800), LDH (0.797), lymphocyte counts (0.788), and age (0.726). NLR predicted mortality better than age, LDH, CRP, and lymphocyte levels, suggesting it may be the best predictive parameter (P &lt; .05). Importantly, we found that the predictive effect of a combination of NLR and acute myocardial injury on death was better than that of NLR or acute myocardial injury alone (0.914 [0.884-0.944]; P &lt; .001; Youden's index = 0.697) (P &lt; .001, combined prediction vs. acute myocardial injury, NLR) (Fig. 1 ).\nWe further analyzed the relationship between survival probability, NLR, and acute myocardial injury. Increased NLR levels and acute myocardial injury reduced the survival probability. There were significant differences between the survival probability when NLR &lt;=6.66 and NLR &gt;6.66, with or without acute myocardial injury (P &lt; .001, Supplementary Fig. 1). A decision tree was built to predict death using the NLR cutoff threshold and acute myocardial injury as the predictor variable. Patients were split into two groups according to acute myocardial injury and then stratified into two subgroups according to NLR (&lt;=6.66 or &gt;6.66). A total of 91 patients who had an acute myocardial injury and an NLR greater than 6.66 were in the first group, in which the mortality rate was 70.3%. A total of 416 patients with an NLR &lt;=6.66 who did not have acute myocardial injury were enrolled in the second group, in which only six (1.4%) patients died. The sensitivity of the diagnostic protocol was 0.84, the specificity was 0.77, the positive predictive value was 0.46, and the negative predictive value was 0.96 (Supplementary Fig. 2). The results suggested that a combination of NLR (&gt;6.66) and acute myocardial injury have a better predictive value of death in patients with COVID-19.\nWe performed a crossover analysis to further clarify whether there was an interaction between NLR and acute myocardial injury and their impact on adverse outcomes. We found that the synergy index (S) was 4.79 (P &lt; .05), suggesting that there was a positive interaction between NLR and acute myocardial injury on death (Supplementary Table 2).\nPrimary outcomes in the PS-matched cohort\nFrom the unadjusted analysis, we determined that the clinical status of patients with an NLR &gt;6.66 was worse at admission. To account for the confusion bias between patients with an NLR &lt;= 6.66 vs. those with an NLR &gt;6.66, we performed PS matching and eventually had two balanced cohorts. The results indicated that the mortality of patients with an NLR &gt;6.66 was higher compared to those patients with an NLR &lt;=6.66. The NLR also increased significantly (P &lt; .001, Supplementary Table 3).\nThe treatments and outcomes of patients with cardiovascular disease\nMultivariate analysis of parameters associated with death in patients with cardiovascular disease.\nTable 4	 	\nCharacteristics	Model 1	Model 2	 	OR (95%CI)	P	OR (95%CI)	P	 	Age	1.077 (1.031-1.125)	0.001	1.081 (1.032-1.131)	0.001	 	Acute myocardial injury	5.781 (2.368-14.116)	0.000	7.708 (2.988-19.887)	0.000	 	NLR	1.129 (1.059-1.204)	0.000	1.132 (1.060-1.210)	0.000	 	CRP (mg/L)	1.015 (1.007-1.023)	0.000	1.016 (1.008-1.024)	0.000	 	LDH (U/L)	1.004 (1.001-1.006)	0.008	1.004 (1.001-1.006)	0.005	 	beta-blockers	0.255 (0.076-0.853)	0.026			 	ACEI/ARB			0.136 (0.035-0.532)	0.004	 	Arbidol	0.246 (0.084-0.723)	0.011	0.205 (0.067-0.631)	0.006	 	Ribavirin	0.238 (0.082-0.685)	0.008	0.208 (0.070-0.618)	0.005	 	\nACEI, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor; ARB, angiotensin receptor blocker.\nAmong all study subjects, 312 (45.8%) had cardiovascular disease (hypertension or CAD). Of these patients, 73 (23.4%) died. The deceased patients received less antiplatelet drugs, statins, beta-blockers, and ACEI/ARB, but used more diuretics. We conducted a multivariable logistic regression in patients combined with COVID-19 and cardiovascular disease to evaluate the efficiency of the intervention. The results showed that age, acute myocardial injury, NLR, CRP, and LDH were still independent risk factors for death in this patient population. Moreover, arbidol and ribavirin were also effective in these patients. Surprisingly, beta-blockers and ACEI/ARB were independently and positively associated with decreased mortality and might have a beneficial effect for COVID-19 patients with cardiovascular disease (Table 4 , Supplementary Table 4).\nDiscussion\nCOVID-19 is a serious threat to public health. Those with severe cases may wonder: &quot;Will I live or die?&quot; Therefore, to clarify their clinic characteristics and seek an efficient therapy to improve their survival and decrease the mortality is urgently needed. In this descriptive study, 681 patients with severe, confirmed cases of COVID-19 were enrolled and all of them reached a clear endpoint (death or hospital discharge). To our best knowledge, this is the largest cohort study of severe COVID-19 cases with a definite endpoint in China. First, we found that age, CRP and LDH levels, CD3 counts, NLR, and acute myocardial injury were independently associated with death in severe COVID-19 patients. The combination of NLR and acute myocardial injury was highly predictive of mortality and survival exclusion diagnosis, more so than NLR or acute myocardial injury alone. Second, arbidol and ribavirin may be a beneficial therapy for COVID-19 and may be associated with improved survival rates. Third, beta-receptor blocking agents, ACEI/ARB, arbidol, and ribavirin were independently and positively associated with death in patients who had COVID-19 and cardiovascular disease. These treatments might be effective in this patient population.\nSARS-CoV-2 infection preferentially afflicts the elderly and those with chronic comorbidities. Compared to survivors, non-survivors were typically older - 73.1% of them were over the age of 65 years, while 2.9% were younger than 40 years old - and had more comorbid conditions. Multivariable logistic regression revealed that older age was independently and negatively associated with death in COVID-19 patients. Meanwhile, 375 patients had underlying comorbidities, with hypertension being the most common, followed by diabetes, and CAD. However, a retrospective study involving 191 patients did not find that comorbidities can independently predict an increased risk of death. Our multivariable regression had similar findings and did not establish an independent predictive value between underlying diseases and mortality.\nAlthough most SARS-CoV-2-infected patients are asymptomatic and have mild cases, severe cases can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiple organ failure, and even death. As of April 20, 2020, the total worldwide case-fatality rate of COVID-19 was 5.2%. However, the mortality was higher in severe and critical patients. One study of 41 patients indicated that 15% of patients died, while the mortality rate increased by 38% in patients requiring ICU admission. In one report in China of 44,672 confirmed cases, including 2087 (5%) critical cases, the overall case-fatality rate was 2.3%, while 49% were critical cases. In another study in Italy of 1591 patients confirmed to have COVID-19, 405 (26%) patients died in ICU. Our mortality rate was 15.3%, and we found that 80% of cases died within 14 days of admission. This heterogeneity may be associated with differences in illness severity.\nViral invasion and rapid replication cause the change of white blood cells and the production of proinflammatory cytokines, resulting in a cytokine storm and pulmonary tissue damage. Elevated inflammatory indicators are predictive of a fatal outcome. Consistent with previous research, we found that traditional infection markers, including the number of white blood cells and serum levels of CRP and IL-6, were significantly higher in non-survivors than in survivors. As a specific marker of systemic inflammation and infection, NLR has prognostic value in predicting the 30-day mortality rate in community-acquired pneumonia. In our study, NLR was significantly higher in non-survivors as compared with survivors. Moreover, higher NLR at admission was associated with an increased risk of death.\nSARS-CoV-2 can cause acute myocardial injury, which was present in 7.2%-30% of hospitalized patients. Acute myocardial injury might be an important cause of severe clinical phenotypes or adverse endpoint events and is considered a predictor of mortality in patients with COVID-19. In this study, levels of LDH and CK-MB were significantly increased in non-survivors, and 72.1% of non-survivors had elevated serum cTnI levels while 11.1% of survivors did. We found that NLR and acute myocardial injury on admission were the two best predictors of mortality in patients with severe cases of COVID-19. Moreover, the combined diagnostic value of these two indicators was significantly better than either alone. The AUC of NLR and acute myocardial injury combined was significantly higher than that of traditional infection markers, such as CRP, and myocardial injury markers, such as LDH and CK-MB. We built a decision tree that showed a combination of NLR and acute myocardial injury was highly predictive of mortality and survival exclusion diagnosis. Therefore, patients with a high NLR (&gt;6.66) and myocardial injury require more aggressive treatment strategies, including appropriate respiratory support or admission to the ICU.\nImpaired immune homeostasis and function are characteristic of severe SARS-CoV-2 infections . Patients with weakened immune systems are more likely to become severely ill. We found both lymphocytes and T cell subset counts (including CD3, CD4, and CD8 T cells) were lower in non-survivors, suggestive of immune function damage. A multivariable logistic regression showed CD3 counts were independently and positively associated with mortality in severe cases of COVID-19. Therefore, a promising treatment strategy for COVID-19 may be to increase the number of immune cells and to recover immune function.\nAlthough physicians want efficient treatments for SARS-CoV-2 infections, there is currently no specific therapeutic drug or vaccine. Antiviral treatment may be promising, antiviral drugs (including arbidol, oseltamivir, lopinavir, and ritonavir, etc.) have been used to treat COVID-19. However, clinical efficacy data is limited. Recently, in one study of 199 patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19, lopinavir-ritonavir treatment showed no benefit beyond standard care, and some patients developed adverse gastrointestinal events during therapy. In an in vitro experiment, arbidol effectively suppressed SARS reproduction. Ribavirin was widely used in Hong Kong during the SARS outbreak. A multivariable regression analysis showed that arbidol and ribavirin may be associated with improved chances of survival and may be beneficial in COVID-19 therapy. IFN-alpha was recommended in the guidelines issued by the National Health Commission of China, based on the beneficial effect seen during SARS. However, we did not see this efficiency in COVID-19 cases. Therefore, every drug regimen for severe cases should include arbidol or ribavirin. Considering the side effects, it is not recommended to use three or more antiviral drugs at the same time. Many patients, particularly severely ill ones, develop a bacterial infection. As such, antibiotic therapy should be considered.\nCoexisting conditions, particularly cardiovascular disease, were common in patients with COVID-19, which might increase the risk of death. A meta-analysis of 1576 patients with COVID-19 indicated that the prevalence of hypertension and CAD was approximately 21.1% and 8.4%, respectively. Patients with cardiovascular disease are more susceptible to severe and fatal SARS-CoV-2 infection, which accounts for a large proportion of COVID-19 deaths. In this study, 45.8% of patients had preexisting cardiovascular disease, of which 23.4% died. During hospitalization, increased cTnI and BNP were observed in 31.1% and 20.5% of patients with cardiovascular disease, respectively. Therefore, medically managing coexisting conditions and preventing cardiac complications should garner more attention. Antiplatelet drugs, statins, beta-blockers, and ACEI/ARB have been wildly used to treat cardiovascular diseases. In this study, we assessed the safety and efficiency of these drugs, and we found both beta-blockers and ACEI/ARB, as well as arbidol and ribavirin, were independently and positively associated with death in patients with COVID-19 and cardiovascular disease, and might be effective in these patients. Recently, Vaduganathan M et al. indicated that patients with COVID-19 and myocardial injury might have higher early risks after ACEI/ARB withdraw, suggesting ACRI/ARB may play a key role in COVID-19.\nThere are several limitations to our study. First, as this is a retrospective study, a number of confounding factors may influence the clinical outcomes. Second, the sample size of our study population was not large enough. Further, multicenter studies are required.\nConclusion\nThe combination of NLR and acute myocardial injury on admission was highly predictive of mortality and survival exclusion diagnosis. Patients with a high NLR (&gt;6.66) and myocardial injury require a more aggressive treatment strategy. Arbidol and ribavirin may be beneficial in severe cases of COVID-19. To the patients combined with COVID-19 and cardiovascular disease, beta-blockers and ACEI/ARB as well as arbidol and ribavirin were also effective. We are anxiously awaiting the results of randomized, controlled clinical trials currently underway, which may provide therapy recommendations for patients with COVID-19.\nFunding\nThis work was supported by the  [BP 0719033], the  [81530014] and the  [81920108003].

China.\n\n We aimed to further clarify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data.\n\n Outcomes were followed up until Jan 25, 2020.\nFindings\nOf the 99 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, 49 (49%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market.\n\n The average age of the patients was 55·5 years (SD 13·1), including 67 men and 32 women.\n\n 2019-nCoV was detected in all patients by real-time RT-PCR.\n\n 50 (51%) patients had chronic diseases.\n\n Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (82 [83%] patients), cough (81 [82%] patients), shortness of breath (31 [31%] patients), muscle ache (11 [11%] patients), confusion (nine [9%] patients), headache (eight [8%] patients), sore throat (five [5%] patients), rhinorrhoea (four [4%] patients), chest pain (two [2%] patients), diarrhoea (two [2%] patients), and nausea and vomiting (one [1%] patient).\n\n According to imaging examination, 74 (75%) patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 14 (14%) patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity, and one (1%) patient had pneumothorax.\n\n 17 (17%) patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and, among them, 11 (11%) patients worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection was of clustering onset, is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n In general, characteristics of patients who died were in line with the MuLBSTA score, an early warning model for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia.\n\n Further investigation is needed to explore the applicability of the MuLBSTA score in

the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41

(one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future

Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%)

(2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute

associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile

Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China5.\n This outbreak highlights the ongoing ability of viral spill-over from animals to cause severe disease in humans.\n","id":"PMC7094943","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing Group

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

a hallmark of MERS-CoV infection.\n The clinical features associated with MERS-CoV infection are not MERS-specific and are similar to other respiratory tract infections.\n Thus, the diagnosis of MERS can easily be missed, unless the doctor or health-care worker has a high degree of clinical awareness and the patient undergoes specific testing for MERS-CoV.\n The largest outbreak of MERS-CoV outside the Arabian Peninsula occurred in South Korea in May, 2015, resulting in 186 cases with 38 deaths.\n This outbreak was caused by a traveller with undiagnosed MERS-CoV infection who became ill

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

and 82% with that of human SARS-CoV.\n The phylogenetic trees of their orf1a/b, Spike, Envelope, Membrane and Nucleoprotein also clustered closely with those of the bat, civet and human SARS coronaviruses.\n However, the external subdomain of Spike’s receptor binding domain of 2019-nCoV shares only 40% amino acid identity with other SARS-related coronaviruses.\n Remarkably, its orf3b encodes a completely novel short protein.\n Furthermore, its new orf8 likely encodes a secreted protein with an alpha-helix, following with a beta-sheet(s) containing six strands.\n Learning from the

implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and Prevention of Infectious Disease in China, Chinese Academy of Sciences,

influenza A, 0·6 days (95% CI 0·5–0·6) for influenza B, 12·5 days (95% CI 11·8–13·3) for measles, 2·6 days (95% CI 2·1–3·1) for parainfluenza, 4·4 days (95% CI 3·9–4·9) for respiratory syncytial virus, and 1·9 days (95% CI 1·4–2·4) for rhinovirus.\n When using the incubation period, it is important to consider its full distribution: the right tail for quarantine policy, the central regions for likely times and sources of infection, and the full distribution for models used in pandemic planning.\n Our estimates combine published data to give the detail necessary for these and other applications.\n","id":"PMC4327893","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

novel coronavirus (CoV).\n\n Clinical data on MERS-CoV infections are scarce.\n\n We report epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of 47 cases of MERS-CoV infections, identify knowledge gaps, and define research priorities.\n\n\nMethods\nWe abstracted and analysed epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and laboratory data from confirmed cases of sporadic, household, community, and health-care-associated MERS-CoV infections reported from Saudi Arabia between Sept 1, 2012, and June 15, 2013. Cases were confirmed as having MERS-CoV by real-time RT-PCR.\n\n\nFindings\n47 individuals (46 adults, one child) with laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV disease were identified; 36 (77%) were male (male:female ratio 3·3:1).\n\n 28 patients died, a 60% case-fatality rate.\n\n The case-fatality rate rose with increasing age.\n\n Only two of the 47 cases were previously healthy; most patients (45 [96%]) had underlying comorbid medical disorders, including diabetes (32 [68%]), hypertension (16 [34%]), chronic cardiac disease (13 [28%]), and chronic renal disease (23 [49%]).\n\n Common symptoms at presentation were fever (46 [98%]), fever with chills or rigors (41 [87%]), cough (39 [83%]), shortness of breath (34 [72%]), and myalgia (15 [32%]).\n\n Gastrointestinal symptoms were also frequent, including diarrhoea (12 [26%]), vomiting (ten [21%]), and abdominal pain (eight [17%]).\n\n All patients had abnormal findings on chest radiography, ranging from subtle to extensive unilateral and bilateral abnormalities.\n\n Laboratory analyses showed raised concentrations of lactate dehydrogenase (23 [49%]) and aspartate aminotransferase (seven [15%]) and thrombocytopenia (17 [36%]) and lymphopenia (16 [34%]).\n\n\nInterpretation\nDisease caused by MERS-CoV presents with a wide range of clinical manifestations and is associated with substantial mortality in admitted patients who have medical comorbidities.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the epidemiology, community prevalence, and clinical spectrum of infection and disease need urgent definition.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7185445","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

clinical pathology of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS): a report from China","abstract":"In order to investigate the clinical pathology of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the autopsies of three patients who died from SARS in Nan Fang Hospital Guangdong, China were studied retrospectively.\n Routine haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining was used to study all of the tissues from the three cases.\n The lung tissue specimens were studied further with Macchiavello staining, viral inclusion body staining, reticulin staining, PAS staining, immunohistochemistry, ultrathin sectioning and staining, light microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy.\n The first symptom was hyperpyrexia in all three cases, followed by progressive dyspnoea and lung field shadowing.\n The pulmonary lesions included bilateral extensive consolidation, localized haemorrhage and necrosis, desquamative pulmonary alveolitis and bronchitis, proliferation and desquamation of alveolar epithelial cells, exudation of protein and monocytes, lymphocytes and plasma cells in alveoli, hyaline membrane formation, and viral inclusion bodies in alveolar epithelial cells.\n There was also massive necrosis of splenic lymphoid tissue and localized necrosis in lymph nodes.\n Systemic vasculitis included oedema, localized fibrinoid necrosis, and infiltration of monocytes, lymphocytes, and plasma cells into vessel walls in the heart, lung, liver, kidney, adrenal gland, and the stroma of striated muscles.\n Thrombosis was present in small veins.\n Systemic toxic changes included degeneration and necrosis of the parenchyma cells in the lung, liver, kidney, heart, and adrenal gland.\n Electron microscopy demonstrated clusters of viral particles, consistent with coronavirus, in lung tissue.\n SARS is a systemic disease that injures many organs.\n The lungs, immune organs, and systemic small vessels are the main targets of virus attack, so that extensive consolidation of the lung, diffuse alveolar damage with hyaline membrane formation, respiratory distress, and decreased immune function are the main causes of death.\n Copyright © 2003 John Wiley &amp; Sons,

but no approved therapeutics are available.\n The CoV nsp14 exoribonuclease (ExoN) has complicated development of antiviral nucleosides due to its proofreading activity.\n We recently reported that the nucleoside analogue GS-5734 (remdesivir) potently inhibits human and zoonotic CoVs in vitro and in a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) mouse model.\n However, studies with GS-5734 have not reported resistance associated with GS-5734, nor do we understand the action of GS-5734 in wild-type (WT) proofreading CoVs.\n Here, we show that GS-5734 inhibits murine hepatitis virus (MHV) with similar 50% effective concentration values (EC50) as SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).\n Passage of WT MHV in the presence of the GS-5734 parent nucleoside selected two mutations in the nsp12 polymerase at residues conserved across all CoVs that conferred up to 5.6-fold resistance to GS-5734, as determined by EC50.\n The resistant viruses were unable to compete with WT in direct coinfection passage in the absence of GS-5734. Introduction of the MHV resistance mutations into SARS-CoV resulted in the same in vitro resistance phenotype and attenuated SARS-CoV pathogenesis in a mouse model.\n Finally, we demonstrate that an MHV mutant lacking ExoN proofreading was significantly more sensitive to GS-5734. Combined, the results indicate that GS-5734 interferes with the nsp12 polymerase even in the setting of intact ExoN proofreading activity and that resistance can be overcome with increased, nontoxic concentrations of GS-5734, further supporting the development of GS-5734 as a broad-spectrum therapeutic to protect against contemporary and emerging

HSV1-infected cells, and those individuals who either lack or have functionally impaired NK cells can suffer severe, recurrent, and sometimes fatal HSV1 infection.\n In this article, we review what is known about the recognition of HSV1 by NK cells, and describe a novel mechanism of innate immune surveillance against certain viral pathogens by NK cells called Fc-bridged cell-mediated cytotoxicity.\n","id":"PMC5816072","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Frontiers Media

A novel mAb, CR3022, was identified that neutralized CR3014 escape viruses, did not compete with CR3014 for binding to recombinant S1 fragments, and bound to S1 fragments derived from the civet cat SARS-CoV-like strain SZ3.

11,900 laboratory-confirmed human infections, including 259 deaths, posing a serious threat to human health.\n Currently, however, there is no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine.\n Considering the relatively high identity of receptor-binding domain (RBD) in 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, it is urgent to assess the cross-reactivity of anti-SARS CoV antibodies with 2019-nCoV spike protein, which could have important implications for rapid development of vaccines and therapeutic antibodies against 2019-nCoV.\n Here, we report for the first time that a SARS-CoV-specific human monoclonal

may have the potential to be developed as candidate therapeutics, alone or in combination with other neutralizing antibodies, for the prevention and treatment of 2019-nCoV infections.\n Interestingly, some of the most potent SARS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies (e.\ng.\n m396, CR3014) that target the ACE2 binding site of SARS-CoV failed to bind 2019-nCoV spike protein, implying that the

disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7092819","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical

been proven effective for the treatment of severe illness caused by SARS-CoV-2.\nMethods\nWe conducted a randomized, controlled, open-label trial involving hospitalized adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, which causes the respiratory illness Covid-19, and an oxygen saturation (Sao2) of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air or a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen (Pao2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) of less than 300 mm Hg.\n\n Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lopinavir–ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively) twice a day for 14 days, in addition to standard care, or standard care alone.\n\n The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement, defined as the time from randomization to either an improvement of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital, whichever came first.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 199 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent randomization; 99 were assigned to the lopinavir–ritonavir group, and 100 to the standard-care group.\n\n Treatment with lopinavir–ritonavir was not associated with a difference from standard care in the time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio for clinical improvement, 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to 1.72).\n\n Mortality at 28 days was similar in the lopinavir–ritonavir group and the standard-care group (19.2% vs.\n\n 25.0%; difference, ?5.8 percentage points; 95% CI, ?17.3 to 5.7).\n\n The percentages of patients with detectable viral RNA at various time points were similar.\n\n In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, lopinavir–ritonavir led to a median time to clinical improvement that was shorter by 1 day than that observed with standard care (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.91).\n\n Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common in the lopinavir–ritonavir group, but serious adverse events were more common in the standard-care group.\n\n Lopinavir–ritonavir treatment was stopped early in 13 patients (13.8%) because of adverse events.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn hospitalized adult patients with severe Covid-19, no benefit was observed with lopinavir–ritonavir treatment beyond standard care.\n\n Future trials in patients with severe illness may help to confirm or exclude the possibility of a treatment benefit.\n\n (Funded by Major Projects of National Science and Technology on New Drug Creation and Development and others; Chinese Clinical Trial Register number,

Various agents were initially proclaimed to be effective against SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19. Hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin are all examples of therapeutic agents, whose efficacy against COVID-19 was later disproved.\n Meanwhile, concentrated efforts of researchers and clinicians worldwide have led to the identification of novel therapeutic options to control the disease including PAXLOVID™ (PF-07321332).\n Although COVID-19 cases are currently treated using a comprehensive approach of anticoagulants, oxygen, and antibiotics, the novel Pfizer agent PAXLOVID™ (PF-07321332), an investigational COVID-19 oral antiviral candidate, significantly reduced hospitalization time and death rates, based on an interim analysis of the phase 2/3 EPIC-HR (Evaluation of Protease Inhibition for COVID-19 in High-Risk Patients) randomized, double-blind study of non-hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19, who are at high risk of progressing to severe illness.\n The scheduled interim analysis demonstrated an 89 % reduction in risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization or death from any cause compared to placebo in patients treated within three days of symptom onset (primary endpoint).\n However, there still exists a great need for the development of additional treatments, as the recommended therapeutic options are insufficient in many cases.\n Thus far, mRNA and vector vaccines appear to be the most effective modalities to control the pandemic.\n In the current review, we provide an update on the progress that has been made since April 2020 in clinical trials concerning the effectiveness of therapies available to combat COVID-19. We focus on currently recommended therapeutic agents, including steroids, various monoclonal antibodies, remdesivir, baricitinib, anticoagulants and PAXLOVID™ summarizing the latest original studies and meta-analyses.\n Moreover, we aim to discuss other currently and previously studied agents targeting COVID-19 that either show no or only limited therapeutic activity.\n The results of recent studies report that hydroxychloroquine and convalescent plasma demonstrate no efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n Lastly, we summarize the studies on various drugs with incoherent or insufficient data concerning their effectiveness, such as amantadine, ivermectin, or niclosamide.\n","id":"PMC8654464","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

(RECOVERY): a randomised, controlled, open-label, platform trial","abstract":"Background\nCasirivimab and imdevimab are non-competing monoclonal antibodies that bind to two different sites on the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, blocking viral entry into host cells.\n\n We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of casirivimab and imdevimab administered in combination in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19.\nMethods\nRECOVERY is a randomised, controlled, open-label platform trial comparing several possible treatments with usual care in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. 127 UK hospitals took part in the evaluation of casirivimab and imdevimab.\n\n Eligible participants were any patients aged at least 12 years admitted to hospital with clinically suspected or laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to either usual standard of care alone or usual care plus casirivimab 4 g and imdevimab 4 g administered together in a single intravenous infusion.\n\n Investigators and data assessors were masked to analyses of the outcome data during the trial.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day all-cause mortality assessed by intention to treat, first only in patients without detectable antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 infection at randomisation (ie, those who were seronegative) and then in the overall population.\n\n Safety was assessed in all participants who received casirivimab and imdevimab.\n\n The trial is registered with ISRCTN (50189673) and ClinicalTrials.\n\ngov (NCT04381936).\n\n\nFindings\nBetween Sept 18, 2020, and May 22, 2021, 9785 patients enrolled in RECOVERY were eligible for casirivimab and imdevimab, of which 4839 were randomly assigned to casirivimab and imdevimab plus usual care and 4946 to usual care alone.\n\n 3153 (32%) of 9785 patients were seronegative, 5272 (54%) were seropositive, and 1360 (14%) had unknown baseline antibody status.\n\n 812 (8%) patients were known to have received at least one dose of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.\n\n In the primary efficacy population of seronegative patients, 396 (24%) of 1633 patients allocated to casirivimab and imdevimab versus 452 (30%) of 1520 patients allocated to usual care died within 28 days (rate ratio [RR] 0·79, 95% CI 0·69–0·91; p=0·0009).\n\n In an analysis of all randomly assigned patients (regardless of baseline antibody status), 943 (19%) of 4839 patients allocated to casirivimab and imdevimab versus 1029 (21%) of 4946 patients allocated to usual care died within 28 days (RR 0·94, 95% CI 0·86–1·02; p=0·14).\n\n The proportional effect of casirivimab and imdevimab on mortality differed significantly between seropositive and seronegative patients (p value for heterogeneity=0·002).\n\n There were no deaths attributed to the treatment, or meaningful between-group differences in the pre-specified safety outcomes of cause-specific mortality, cardiac arrhythmia, thrombosis, or major bleeding events.\n\n Serious adverse reactions reported in seven (&lt;1%) participants were believed by the local investigator to be related to treatment with casirivimab and imdevimab.\n\n\nInterpretation\nIn patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, the monoclonal antibody combination of casirivimab and imdevimab reduced 28-day mortality in patients who were seronegative (and therefore had not mounted their own humoral immune response) at baseline but not in those who were seropositive at baseline.\n\n\nFunding\nUK Research and Innovation

antibodies","abstract":"id='Par1'>The SARS-CoV-2 B.\n1.1.529 (Omicron) variant contains 15 mutations of the receptor-binding domain (RBD).\n How Omicron evades RBD-targeted neutralizing antibodies requires immediate investigation.\n Here we use high-throughput yeast display screening1,2 to determine the profiles of RBD escaping mutations for 247 human anti-RBD neutralizing antibodies and show that the neutralizing antibodies can be classified by unsupervised clustering into six epitope groups (A–F)—a grouping that is highly concordant with knowledge-based structural classifications3–5.\n Various single mutations of Omicron can impair neutralizing antibodies of different epitope groups.\n Specifically, neutralizing antibodies in groups A–D, the epitopes of which overlap with the ACE2-binding motif, are largely escaped by K417N, G446S, E484A and Q493R.\n Antibodies in group E (for example, S309)6 and group F (for example, CR3022)7, which often exhibit broad sarbecovirus neutralizing activity, are less affected by Omicron, but a subset of neutralizing antibodies are still escaped by G339D, N440K and S371L.\n Furthermore, Omicron pseudovirus neutralization showed that neutralizing antibodies that sustained single mutations could also be escaped, owing to multiple synergetic mutations on their epitopes.\n In total, over 85% of the tested neutralizing antibodies were escaped by Omicron.\n With regard to neutralizing-antibody-based drugs, the neutralization potency of LY-CoV016, LY-CoV555, REGN10933, REGN10987, AZD1061, AZD8895 and BRII-196 was greatly undermined by Omicron, whereas VIR-7831 and DXP-604 still functioned at a reduced efficacy.\n Together, our data suggest that infection with Omicron would result in considerable humoral immune evasion, and that neutralizing antibodies targeting the sarbecovirus conserved region will remain most effective.\n Our results inform the development of antibody-based drugs and vaccines against Omicron and future variants.\n","id":"PMC8866119","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing Group

to facilitate its infection.\n Here, we first discover an interaction between host cell receptor CD147 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.\n The loss of CD147 or blocking CD147 in Vero E6 and BEAS-2B cell lines by anti-CD147 antibody, Meplazumab, inhibits SARS-CoV-2 amplification.\n Expression of human CD147 allows virus entry into non-susceptible BHK-21 cells, which can be neutralized by CD147 extracellular fragment.\n Viral loads are detectable in the lungs of human CD147 (hCD147) mice infected with SARS-CoV-2, but not in those of virus-infected wild type mice.\n Interestingly, virions are observed in lymphocytes of lung tissue from a COVID-19 patient.\n Human T cells with a property of ACE2 natural deficiency can be infected with SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus in a dose-dependent manner, which is specifically inhibited by Meplazumab.\n Furthermore, CD147 mediates virus entering host cells by endocytosis.\n Together, our study reveals a novel virus entry route, CD147-spike protein, which provides an important target for developing specific and effective drug against COVID-19.","id":"PMC7714896","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing Group

of a novel human CD147 knock-in NSG mouse model to test SARS-CoV-2 viral infection","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>An animal model that can mimic the SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans is critical to understanding the rapidly evolving SARS-CoV-2 virus and for development of prophylactic and therapeutic strategies to combat emerging mutants.\n\n Studies show that the spike proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 bind to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2, a well-recognized, functional receptor for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) to mediate viral entry.\n\n Several hACE2 transgenic (hACE2Tg) mouse models are being widely used, which are clearly invaluable.\n\n However, the hACE2Tg mouse model cannot fully explain: (1) low expression of ACE2 observed in human lung and heart, but lung or heart failure occurs frequently in severe COVID-19 patients; (2) low expression of ACE2 on immune cells, but lymphocytopenia occurs frequently in COVID-19 patients; and (3) hACE2Tg mice do not mimic the natural course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.\n\n Moreover, one of most outstanding features of coronavirus infection is the diversity of receptor usage, which includes the newly proposed human CD147 (hCD147) as a possible co-receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry.\n\n It is still debatable whether CD147 can serve as a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infection or entry.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par2'>Here we successfully generated a hCD147 knock-in mouse model (hCD147KI) in the NOD-scid IL2Rgammanull (NSG) background.\n\n In this hCD147KI-NSG mouse model, the hCD147 genetic sequence was placed downstream of the endogenous mouse promoter for mouse CD147 (mCD147), which creates an in vivo model that may better recapitulate physiological expression of hCD147 proteins at the molecular level compared to the existing and well-studied K18-hACE2-B6 (JAX) model.\n\n In addition, the hCD147KI-NSG mouse model allows further study of SARS-CoV-2 in the immunodeficiency condition which may assist our understanding of this virus in the context of high-risk populations in immunosuppressed states.\n\n Our data show (1) the human CD147 protein is expressed in various organs (including bronchiolar epithelial cells) in hCD147KI-NSG mice by immunohistochemical staining and flow cytometry; (2) hCD147KI-NSG mice are marginally sensitive to SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to WT-NSG littermates characterized by increased viral copies by qRT-PCR and moderate body weight decline compared to baseline; (3) a significant increase in leukocytes in the lungs of hCD147KI-NSG mice, compared to infected WT-NSG mice.\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par3'>hCD147KI-NSG mice are more sensitive to COVID-19 infection compared to WT-NSG mice.\n\n The hCD147KI-NSG mouse model can serve as an additional animal model for further interrogation whether CD147 serve as an independent functional receptor or accessory receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry and immune responses.\n\n\nSupplementary Information\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at

humanized CD147 transgenic mice were susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and its two variants, alpha and beta.\n When infected, these mice developed exudative alveolar pneumonia, featured by immune responses involving alveoli-infiltrated macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes and activation of IL-17 signaling pathway.\n Mechanistically, we proposed that severe COVID-19-related cytokine storm is induced by a “spike protein-CD147-CyPA signaling axis”: Infection of SARS-CoV-2 through CD147 initiated the JAK-STAT pathway, which further induced expression of cyclophilin A (CyPA); CyPA reciprocally bound to CD147 and triggered MAPK pathway.\n Consequently, the MAPK pathway regulated the expression of cytokines and chemokines, which promoted the development of cytokine storm.\n Importantly, Meplazumab

symptomatic and for activating public health measures.\n Antigen rapid detection tests detect viral proteins and, although they are less sensitive than molecular tests, have the advantages of being easier to do, giving a faster time to result, of being lower cost, and able to detect infection in those who are most likely to be at risk of transmitting the virus to others.\n Antigen rapid detection tests can be used as a public health tool for screening individuals at enhanced risk of infection, to protect people who are clinically vulnerable, to ensure safe travel and the resumption of schooling and social activities, and to enable economic recovery.\n With vaccine roll-out, antibody tests (which detect the host's response to infection or vaccination) can be useful surveillance tools to inform public policy, but should not be used to provide proof of immunity, as the correlates of protection remain unclear.\n All three types of COVID-19 test continue to have a crucial role

17-year-old male with haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) secondary to COVID-19 infection.\n\n\nCase report\nThis patient presented with cough, sore throat, anorexia and pyrexia.\n\n On examination, he had gross cervical lymphadenopathy and palpable splenomegaly.\n\n Nose and throat swab for SARS-CoV-2 was positive and blood tests revealed pancytopaenia with very high ferritin, triglyceride and d-dimer levels.\n\n The patient's H-Score [2] was calculated at 220, suggesting probability of HLH of 93–96%.\n\n Considering Russell and colleagues' [3] comments about potential harm of corticosteroid use in patients with COVID-19 infection, the patient was commenced on treatment with the selective IL-1 receptor antagonist drug, Anakinra, and a two-day course of intravenous immunoglobulin.\n\n\nResults\nThe patient responded rapidly to treatment, becoming apyrexial after 24?h.\n\n His lymph nodes and spleen began to normalise after the first 48?h, at which time point the ferritin also started to decrease.\n\n He was discharged after 11?days feeling fit and well.\n\n\nConclusion\nThis case certainly illustrates the importance of hyperinflammation syndromes in COVID-19. It also raises the question – is the severe pneumonitis seen in patients with COVID-19 an immunological phenomenon? We know that the viral load of patients with COVID-19 seems to peak in the early stages of illness [4,5]; however, patients deteriorate later in the disease course, at around days 10–14. This patient, who had risk factors for deterioration (male, pancytopaenic), did not develop an oxygen requirement and clinically and biochemically improved rapidly on Anakinra with no adverse events.\n\n We might suggest Anakinra to the scientific community as a treatment option in COVID-19 infection.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7245680","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"The Author(s).

Sex-specific expression patterns of proteins mediating virus binding and entry, and divergent reactions of the immune and endocrine system, in particular the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis, in response to acute stress might explain the higher severity of COVID-19 in men.\n In this Personal View, we discuss how sex hormones, comorbidities, and the sex chromosome complement influence these

Due to its role in the severity and progression of SARS-CoV-2 infections, we argue that sexual dimorphism has potential implications for disease treatment, public health measures, and follow-up of

cardiovascular comorbidities","abstract":"The high mortality rate of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is a critical concern of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.\n Strikingly, men account for the majority of COVID-19 deaths, with current figures ranging from 59% to 75% of total mortality.\n However, despite clear implications in relation to COVID-19 mortality, most research has not considered sex as a critical factor in data analysis.\n Here, we highlight fundamental biological differences that exist between males and females, and how these may make significant contributions to the male-biased COVID-19 mortality.\n We present preclinical evidence identifying the influence of biological sex on the expression and regulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the main receptor used by SARS-CoV-2 to enter cells.\n However, we note that there is a lack of reports showing that sexual dimorphism of ACE2 expression exists and is of functional relevance in humans.\n In contrast, there is strong evidence, especially in the context of viral infections, that sexual dimorphism plays a central role in the genetic and hormonal regulation of immune responses, both of the innate and the adaptive immune system.\n We review evidence supporting that ineffective anti-SARS-CoV-2 responses, coupled with a predisposition for inappropriate hyperinflammatory responses, could provide a biological explanation for the male bias in COVID-19 mortality.\n A prominent finding in COVID-19 is the increased risk of death with pre-existing cardiovascular comorbidities, such as hypertension, obesity, and age.\n We contextualize how important features of sexual dimorphism and inflammation in COVID-19 may exhibit a reciprocal relationship with comorbidities, and explain their increased mortality risk.\n Ultimately, we demonstrate that biological sex is a fundamental variable of critical relevance to our mechanistic understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the pursuit of effective COVID-19 preventative and therapeutic strategies.\n","id":"PMC7665363","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Oxford University Press","authors":[{"firstname":"Laura

decided to perform a new meta-analysis of the observational studies that explored the relationship between pre-existing hypertension and mortality risk in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, using more stringent inclusion criteria to overcome the limitations inherent previous meta-analyses.\n\n\nMethods\nA systematic search of the on-line databases available up to 31 March 2022 was conducted, including peer-reviewed original articles, involving the adult population, where the role of hypertension on mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 infection was determined by Cox-proportional hazard models.\n\n

Many epidemiologic studies have been conducted since that time concluding that SARS-CoV-2 increased the incidence of myocarditis/pericarditis at least 15× over pre-COVID levels although the condition remains rare.\n The incidence of myocarditis pre-COVID was reported at 1 to 10 cases/100 000 individuals and with COVID ranging from 150 to 4000 cases/100 000 individuals.\n Before COVID-19, some vaccines were reported to cause myocarditis and pericarditis in rare cases, but the use of novel mRNA platforms led to a higher number of reported cases than with previous platforms providing new insight into potential pathogenic mechanisms.\n The incidence of COVID-19 vaccine-associated myocarditis/pericarditis covers a large range depending on the vaccine platform, age, and sex examined.\n Importantly, the findings highlight that myocarditis occurs predominantly in male patients aged 12 to 40 years regardless of whether the cause was due to a virus-like SARS-CoV-2 or associated with a vaccine—a demographic that has been reported before COVID-19. This review discusses findings from COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccine-associated myocarditis and pericarditis considering the known symptoms, diagnosis, management, treatment, and pathogenesis of disease that has been gleaned from clinical research and animal models.\n Sex differences in the immune response to COVID-19 are discussed, and theories for how mRNA vaccines could lead to myocarditis/pericarditis are proposed.\n Additionally, gaps in our understanding that need further research are raised.\n","id":"PMC10171304","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Lippincott

COVID-19 is the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, a virus that targets not only the lungs but also the cardiovascular system.\n COVID-19 can manifest with a wide range of clinical manifestations, from mild symptoms to severe forms of the disease, characterized by respiratory failure due to severe alveolar damage.\n Several studies investigated the underlying mechanisms of the severe lung damage associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and revealed that the respiratory failure associated with COVID-19 is the consequence not only of acute respiratory distress syndrome but also of macro- and

(ACE2) is a type I integral membrane that exists in two forms: the first is a transmembrane protein; the second is a soluble catalytic ectodomain of ACE2. The catalytic ectodomain of ACE2 undergoes shedding by a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 17 (ADAM17), in which calmodulin mediates the calcium signaling pathway that is involved in ACE2 release, resulting in a soluble catalytic ectodomain of ACE2 that can be measured as soluble ACE2 plasma activity.\n The shedding of the ACE2 catalytic ectodomain plays a role in cardiac remodeling and endothelial dysfunction and is a predictor of all-cause mortality, including cardiovascular mortality.\n Moreover, considerable evidence supports that the ACE2 catalytic ectodomain is an essential entry receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.\n Additionally, endotoxins and the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1? and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF?) all enhanced soluble catalytic ectodomain ACE2 shedding from the airway epithelia, suggesting that the shedding of ACE2 may represent a mechanism by which viral entry and infection may be controlled such as some types of betacoronavirus.\n In this regard, ACE2 plays an important role in inflammation and thrombotic response, and its down-regulation may aggravate COVID-19 via the renin-angiotensin system, including by promoting pathological changes in lung injury.\n Soluble forms of ACE2 have recently been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n Furthermore, given that vitamin D enhanced the shedding of ACE2, some studies reported that vitamin D treatment is associated with prognosis improvement in COVID-19.

trivalent function: a negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system, facilitator of amino acid transport, and the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2 receptor.\n ACE2 is widely expressed, including, in the lungs, cardiovascular system, gut, kidneys, central nervous system, and adipose tissue.\n ACE2 has recently been identified as the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, the infective agent responsible for coronavirus disease 2019, providing a critical link between immunity, inflammation, ACE2, and cardiovascular disease.\n Although sharing a close evolutionary relationship with SARS-CoV, the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 differs in several key amino acid residues, allowing for stronger binding affinity with the human ACE2 receptor, which may account for the greater pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. The loss of ACE2 function following binding by SARS-CoV-2 is driven by endocytosis and activation of proteolytic cleavage and processing.\n The ACE2 system is a critical protective pathway against heart failure with reduced and preserved ejection fraction including, myocardial infarction and hypertension, and against lung disease and diabetes mellitus.\n The control of gut dysbiosis and vascular permeability by ACE2 has emerged as an essential mechanism of pulmonary hypertension and diabetic cardiovascular complications.\n Recombinant ACE2, gene-delivery of Ace2, Ang 1–7 analogs, and Mas receptor agonists enhance ACE2 action and serve as potential therapies for disease conditions associated with an activated renin-angiotensin system.\n rhACE2 (recombinant human ACE2) has completed clinical trials and efficiently lowered or increased plasma angiotensin II and angiotensin 1-7 levels, respectively.\n Our review summarizes the progress over the past 20 years, highlighting the critical role of ACE2 as the novel SARS-CoV-2 receptor and as the negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system, together with implications for the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and associated cardiovascular diseases.\n","id":"PMC7188049","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Lippincott Williams &amp;

trends and predictors of in-hospital death in patients with COVID-19 and PE in Germany.\n\n\nMethods\nWe used a German nationwide inpatient sample to analyse data on hospitalisations among COVID-19 patients with and without PE during 2020, and to detect changes in PE prevalence and case fatality in comparison with 2019.\nResults\nWe analysed 176?137 COVID-19 hospitalisations in 2020; PE was

disease.\n We measured one hundred and forty-four (144) metabolites using ultra high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF-MS) to identify metabolic changes in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, in lean and obese COVID-19 positive (n=82) and COVID-19 negative (n=24) patients.\n The identified metabolites are found to be mainly correlating with glucose, energy and steroid metabolisms.\n Further data analysis indicated twelve (12) significantly yet differentially abundant metabolites associated with viral infection and health complications, in COVID-19 obese patients.\n Two of the detected metabolites, n6-acetyl-l-lysine and p-cresol, are detected only among the COVID-19 cohort, exhibiting significantly higher levels in COVID-19 obese patients when compared to COVID-19 lean patients.\n These metabolites have important roles in viral entry and could explain the increased susceptibility of obese patients.\n On the same note, a set of six metabolites associated with antiviral and anti-inflammatory functions displayed significantly lower abundance in COVID-19 obese patients.\n In conclusion, this report highlights the plasma metabolome of COVID-19 obese patients as a metabolic feature and signature to help improve clinical outcomes.\n We propose n6-acetyl-l-lysine and p-cresol as potential metabolic markers which warrant further investigations to better understand their involvement in different metabolic pathways in COVID-19.","id":"PMC9161728","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Frontiers Media

Protein Complex Formation Increases the Risk of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein-Induced Cardiomyocyte Dysfunction through ACE2 Upregulation","abstract":"Myocardial damage caused by the newly emerged coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection is one of the key determinants of COVID-19 severity and mortality.\n SARS-CoV-2 entry to host cells is initiated by binding with its receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2, and the ACE2 abundance is thought to reflect the susceptibility to infection.\n Here, we report that ibudilast, which we previously identified as a potent inhibitor of protein complex between transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) 3 and NADPH oxidase (Nox) 2, attenuates the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein pseudovirus-evoked contractile and metabolic dysfunctions of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs).\n Epidemiologically reported risk factors of severe COVID-19, including cigarette sidestream smoke (CSS) and anti-cancer drug treatment, commonly upregulate ACE2 expression level, and these were suppressed by inhibiting TRPC3-Nox2 complex formation.\n Exposure of NRCMs to SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, as well as CSS and doxorubicin (Dox), induces ATP release through pannexin-1 hemi-channels, and this ATP release potentiates pseudovirus entry to NRCMs and human iPS cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPS-CMs).\n As the pseudovirus entry followed by production of reactive oxygen species was attenuated by inhibiting TRPC3-Nox2 complex in hiPS-CMs, we suggest that TRPC3-Nox2 complex formation triggered by panexin1-mediated ATP release participates in exacerbation of myocardial

disorders.\n Detailed understanding of the structural features of the three isoforms (apoE2, apoE3, and apoE4), which differ by only a single amino acid interchange, has elucidated their unique functions.\n ApoE2 and apoE4 increase the risk for heart disease: apoE2 increases atherogenic lipoprotein levels (it binds poorly to LDL receptors), and apoE4 increases LDL levels (it binds preferentially to triglyceride-rich, very low density lipoproteins, leading to downregulation of LDL receptors).\n ApoE4 also increases the risk for neurodegenerative diseases, decreases their age of onset, or alters their progression.\n ApoE4 likely causes neurodegeneration secondary to its abnormal structure, caused by an interaction between its carboxyl- and amino-terminal domains, called domain interaction.\n When neurons are stressed or injured, they synthesize apoE to redistribute cholesterol for neuronal repair or remodeling.\n However, because of its altered structure, neuronal apoE4 undergoes neuron-specific proteolysis, generating neurotoxic fragments (12–29 kDa) that escape the secretory pathway and cause mitochondrial dysfunction and cytoskeletal alterations, including tau phosphorylation.\n ApoE4-associated pathology can be prevented by small-molecule structure correctors that block domain interaction by converting apoE4 to a molecule that resembles apoE3 both

subjects matched for cardiovascular risk factors similar to ICU COVID-19 patients, and ICU septic shock patients unrelated to COVID-19.\nFindings\nEarly SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with an imbalance between an exacerbated oxidative stress (plasma peroxides levels in ICU patients vs.\n\n controls: 1456.0 ± 400.2 vs 436 ± 272.1 mmol/L; P &lt; 0.05) and a reduced nitric oxide

pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiorgan failure in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n However, the molecular mechanisms underlying endothelial activation in COVID-19 patients remain unclear.\n In this study, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral proteins that potently activate human endothelial cells were screened to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in endothelial activation.\n It was found that nucleocapsid protein (NP) of SARS-CoV-2 significantly activated human endothelial cells through Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)/NF-?B and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways.\n Moreover, by screening a natural microbial compound library containing 154 natural compounds, simvastatin was identified as a potent inhibitor of NP-induced endothelial activation.\n Remarkably, though the protein sequences of N proteins from coronaviruses are highly conserved, only NP from SARS-CoV-2 induced endothelial activation.\n The NPs from other coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), HUB1-CoV, and influenza virus H1N1 did not activate endothelial cells.\n These findings are consistent with the results from clinical investigations showing broad endotheliitis and organ injury in severe COVID-19 patients.\n In conclusion, the

protect against oxidative damage.\n There is growing evidence to suggest that coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients exhibit a wide range of post-recovery symptoms and shows signs related to cardiovascular and specifically, endothelial damage.\n We hypothesized that these vascular symptoms might be associated with disrupted endothelial barrier integrity.\n This was investigated in vitro using endothelial cell culture and recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 Receptor-Binding Domain (Spike).\n Mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells from normal (C57BL/6 mice) and diabetic (db/db) mice were used.\n An endothelial transwell permeability assay revealed increased permeability in diabetic cells as well as after Spike treatment.\n The expression of VE-Cadherin, an endothelial adherens junction protein, JAM-A, a tight junctional protein, Connexin-43, a gap junctional protein, and PECAM-1, were all decreased significantly after Spike treatment in control and to a greater extent, in diabetic cells.\n In control cells, Spike treatment increased association of endothelial junctional proteins with Rab5a, a mediator of the endocytic trafficking compartment.\n In cerebral arteries isolated from control and diabetic animals, Spike protein had a greater effect in downregulating expression of endothelial junctional proteins in arteries from diabetic animals than from control animals.\n In conclusion, these experiments reveal that Spike-induced degradation of endothelial junctional proteins affects endothelial barrier function and is the likely cause of

Role of Platelet-Endothelium Interactions in the Pathogenesis of Severe SARS-CoV-2 Infection-Associated Myocardial Injury","abstract":"Cardiovascular dysfunction and disease are common and frequently fatal complications of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.\n Indeed, from early on during the SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic it was recognized that cardiac complications may occur, even in patients with no underlying cardiac disorders, as part of the acute infection, and that these were associated with more severe disease and increased morbidity and mortality.\n The most common cardiac complication is acute cardiac injury, defined by significant elevation of cardiac troponins.\n The potential mechanisms of cardiovascular complications include direct viral myocardial injury, systemic inflammation induced by the virus, sepsis, arrhythmia, myocardial oxygen supply-demand mismatch, electrolyte abnormalities, and hypercoagulability.\n This review is focused on the prevalence, risk factors and clinical course of COVID-19-related myocardial injury, as well as on current data with regard to disease pathogenesis, specifically the interaction of platelets with the vascular endothelium.\n The latter section includes consideration of the role of SARS-CoV-2 proteins in triggering development of a generalized endotheliitis that, in turn, drives intense activation of platelets.\n Most prominently, SARS-CoV-2–induced endotheliitis involves interaction of the viral spike protein with endothelial angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) together with alternative mechanisms that involve the nucleocapsid and viroporin.\n In addition, the mechanisms by which activated platelets intensify endothelial activation and dysfunction, seemingly driven by release of the platelet-derived calcium-binding proteins, SA100A8 and SA100A9, are described.\n These events create a SARS-CoV-2–driven cycle of intravascular inflammation and coagulation, which contributes significantly to a poor clinical outcome in patients with severe disease.\n","id":"PMC8854752","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Frontiers Media

decrease in physical activity due to mechanized transportations and sedentary form of leisure time activities.\n The syndrome feeds into the spread of the diseases like type 2 diabetes, coronary

nonetheless, there are remaining challenges and emerging questions in the field.\n In this article, we aim to summarize the latest information on the impact of the pandemic on blood pressure control, the use of the renin-angiotensin system inhibitors in patients with COVID-19, and the blood pressure changes as one of the possible post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (also known as long COVID).\n We also summarize the evidence of telemedicine and COVID-19 vaccination in hypertensive subjects, based on data available as of June 2022.","id":"PMC9780104","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Springer Nature Singapore","authors":[{"firstname":"Shigeru","surname":"Shibata","email":"shigeru.shibata@med.teikyo-u.ac.jp","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kazuo","surname":"Kobayashi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Masami","surname":"Tanaka","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kei","surname":"Asayama","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Eiichiro","surname":"Yamamoto","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hironori","surname":"Nakagami","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Satoshi","surname":"Hoshide","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Takuya","surname":"Kishi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chisa","surname":"Matsumoto","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Masaki","surname":"Mogi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Satoshi","surname":"Morimoto","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Koichi","surname":"Yamamoto","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Masashi","surname":"Mukoyama","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kazuomi","surname":"Kario","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Koichi","surname":"Node","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hiromi","surname":"Rakugi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.metabol.2022.155236","date":"2022-06-01","title":"SARS-CoV-2 infection impairs the insulin/IGF signaling pathway in the lung, liver, adipose tissue, and pancreatic cells via IRF1","abstract":"Background\nCOVID-19 can cause multiple organ damages as well as metabolic abnormalities such as hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and new onset of diabetes.\n\n The insulin/IGF signaling pathway plays an important role in regulating energy metabolism and cell survival, but little is known about the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n The aim of this work was to investigate whether SARS-CoV-2 infection impairs the insulin/IGF signaling pathway in the host cell/tissue, and if so, the potential mechanism and association with COVID-19 pathology.\n\n\nMethods\nTo determine the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on insulin/IGF signaling pathway, we utilized transcriptome datasets of SARS-CoV-2 infected cells and tissues from public repositories for a wide range of high-throughput gene expression data: autopsy lungs from COVID-19 patients compared to the control from non-COVID-19 patients; lungs from a human ACE2 transgenic mouse infected with SARS-CoV-2 compared to the control infected with mock; human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived liver organoids infected with SARS-CoV-2; adipose tissues from a mouse model of COVID-19 overexpressing human ACE2 via adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) compared to the control GFP after SARS-CoV-2 infection;

increased with aging in the lung, specifically in men; augmented by obese and diabetic conditions in liver, adipose tissue, and pancreatic islets.\n\n IRF1 activation was significantly associated with the impaired insulin signaling in human cells.\n\n IRF1 intron variant rs17622656-A, which was previously reported to be associated with COVID-19 prevalence, increased the IRF1 gene expression in human tissue and was frequently found in American and European population.\n\n Critical patients with COVID-19 exhibited higher IRF1 and lower insulin/IGF signaling pathway genes in the whole blood compared to hospitalized noncritical patients.\n\n Hormonal interventions, such as dihydrotestosterone and dexamethasone, ameliorated the pathological traits in SARS-CoV-2 infectable cells and tissues.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe present study provides the first scientific evidence that SARS-CoV-2 infection impairs the insulin/IGF signaling pathway in respiratory, metabolic, and endocrine cells and tissues.\n\n This feature likely contributes to COVID-19 severity with cell/tissue damage and metabolic abnormalities, which may be exacerbated in older, male, obese, or diabetic patients.\n\n\n","id":"PMC9173833","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"The Authors.

ACE2 receptors are ubiquitous and widely expressed in the heart, vessels, gut, lung (particularly in type 2 pneumocytes and macrophages), kidney, testis and brain.\n ACE2 is mostly bound to cell membranes and only scarcely present in the circulation in a soluble form.\n An important salutary function of membrane-bound and soluble ACE2 is the degradation of angiotensin II to angiotensin1-7.\n Consequently, ACE2 receptors limit several detrimental effects resulting from binding of angiotensin II to AT1 receptors, which include vasoconstriction, enhanced inflammation and thrombosis.\n The increased generation of angiotensin1-7 also triggers counter-regulatory protective effects through binding to G-protein coupled Mas receptors.\n Unfortunately, the entry of SARS-CoV2 into the cells through membrane fusion markedly down-regulates ACE2 receptors, with loss of the catalytic effect of these receptors at the external site of the membrane.\n Increased pulmonary inflammation and coagulation have been reported as unwanted effects of enhanced and unopposed angiotensin II effects via the ACE?Angiotensin II?AT1 receptor axis.\n Clinical reports of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 show that several features associated with infection and severity of the disease (i.\ne.\n, older age, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease) share a variable degree of ACE2 deficiency.\n We suggest that ACE2 down-regulation induced by viral invasion may be especially detrimental in people with baseline ACE2 deficiency associated with the above conditions.\n The additional ACE2 deficiency after viral invasion might amplify the dysregulation between the ‘adverse’ ACE?Angiotensin II?AT1 receptor axis and the ‘protective’ ACE2?Angiotensin1-7?Mas receptor axis.\n In the lungs, such dysregulation would favor the progression of inflammatory and thrombotic processes triggered by local angiotensin II hyperactivity unopposed by angiotensin1-7.\n In this setting, recombinant ACE2, angiotensin1-7 and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers could be promising therapeutic approaches in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n","id":"PMC7167588","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"European Federation of Internal Medicine.

By extracting and analyzing all available published clinical data, we identified several major clinical characteristics associated with increased disease severity and mortality among patients with COVID-19. Specifically, preexisting chronic conditions such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes are strongly associated with an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19; surprisingly, however, we found no correlation between chronic liver disease and increased disease severity.\n In addition, we found that both acute cardiac injury and acute kidney injury are highly correlated with an increased risk of COVID-19-related mortality.\n Given the high risk of comorbidity and the high mortality rate associated with tissue damage, organ function should be monitored closely in patients diagnosed with COVID-19, and this approach should be included when establishing new guidelines for managing these high-risk patients.\n Moreover, additional clinical data are needed in order to determine whether a supportive therapy can help mitigate the development of severe, potentially fatal complications, and further studies are needed to identify the pathophysiology and the mechanism underlying this novel coronavirus-associated infectious disease.\n Taken together, these findings provide new insights regarding clinical strategies for improving the management and outcome of patients with COVID-19.","id":"PMC7187729","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"AAAS","authors":[{"firstname":"Xinhui","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuexian","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuexian","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhaoxian","surname":"Cai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhaoxian","surname":"Cai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaotian","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaotong","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaotong","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Junxia","surname":"Min","email":"junxiamin@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Junxia","surname":"Min","email":"junxiamin@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fudi","surname":"Wang","email":"fwang@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fudi","surname":"Wang","email":"fwang@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2002032","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China","abstract":"Background\nSince December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020.

2019 (Covid-19) has not been well studied.\n\n\nMethods\nWe carried out a population-based case–control study in the Lombardy region of Italy.\n\n A total of 6272 case patients in whom infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was confirmed between February 21 and March 11, 2020, were matched to 30,759 beneficiaries of the Regional Health Service (controls) according to sex, age, and municipality of residence.\n\n Information about the use of selected drugs and patients’ clinical profiles was obtained from regional databases of health care use.\n\n Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for associations between drugs and infection, with adjustment for confounders, were estimated by means of logistic regression.\n\n\nResults\nAmong both case patients and controls, the mean (±SD) age was 68±13 years, and 37% were women.\n\n The use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs was more common among case patients than among controls, as was the use of other antihypertensive and non-antihypertensive drugs, and case patients had a worse clinical profile.\n\n Use of ARBs or ACE inhibitors did not show any association with Covid-19 among case patients overall (adjusted odds ratio, 0.95 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.86 to 1.05] for ARBs and 0.96 [95% CI, 0.87 to 1.07] for ACE inhibitors) or among patients who had a severe or fatal course of the disease (adjusted odds ratio, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.63 to 1.10] for ARBs and 0.91 [95% CI, 0.69 to 1.21] for ACE inhibitors), and no association between these variables was found according to sex.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn this large, population-based study, the use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs was more frequent among patients with Covid-19 than among controls because of their higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease.\n\n However, there was no evidence that ACE inhibitors or ARBs affected the risk of

inhibitors might influence the severity of COVID-19. We aimed to evaluate whether continuing versus discontinuing renin–angiotensin system inhibitors (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers) affects outcomes in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19.\nMethods\nThe REPLACE COVID trial was a prospective, randomised, open-label trial done at 20 large referral hospitals in seven countries worldwide.\n\n Eligible participants were aged 18 years and older who were admitted to hospital with COVID-19 and were receiving a renin–angiotensin system inhibitor before admission.\n\n Individuals with contraindications to continuation or discontinuation of renin–angiotensin system inhibitor therapy were excluded.\n\n Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to continuation or discontinuation of their renin–angiotensin system inhibitor using permuted block randomisation, with allocation concealed using a secure web-based randomisation system.\n\n The primary outcome was a global rank score in which participants were ranked across four hierarchical tiers incorporating time to death, duration of mechanical ventilation, time on renal replacement or vasopressor therapy, and multiorgan dysfunction during the hospitalisation.\n\n Primary analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population.\n\n The REPLACE COVID trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.\n\ngov, NCT04338009.\n\n\nFindings\nBetween March 31 and Aug 20, 2020, 152 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to either continue or discontinue renin–angiotensin system inhibitor therapy (continuation group n=75; discontinuation group n=77).\n\n Mean age of participants was 62 years (SD 12), 68 (45%) were female, mean body-mass index was 33 kg/m2 (SD 8), and 79 (52%) had diabetes.\n\n Compared with discontinuation of renin–angiotensin system inhibitors, continuation had no effect on the global rank score (median rank 73 [IQR 40–110] for continuation vs 81 [38–117] for discontinuation; ?-coefficient 8 [95% CI ?13 to 29]).\n\n There were 16 (21%) of 75 participants in the continuation arm versus 14 (18%) of 77 in the discontinuation arm who required intensive care unit admission or invasive mechanical ventilation, and 11 (15%) of 75 participants in the continuation group versus ten (13%) of 77 in the discontinuation group died.\n\n 29 (39%) participants in the continuation group and 28 (36%) participants in the discontinuation group had at least one adverse event (?2 test of adverse events between treatment groups p=0·77).\n\n There was no difference in

angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) mitigates the course o\f recent-onset COVID-19.\nMethods\nACEI-COVID was a parallel group, randomised, controlled, open-label trial done at 35 centres in Austria and Germany.\n\n Patients aged 18 years and older were enrolled if they presented with recent symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and were chronically treated with ACEIs or ARBs.\n\n Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to discontinuation or continuation of RAS inhibition for 30 days.\n\n Primary outcome was the maximum sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score within 30 days, where death was scored with the maximum achievable SOFA score.\n\n Secondary endpoints were area under the death-adjusted SOFA score (AUCSOFA), mean SOFA score, admission to the intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, and death.\n\n Analyses were done on a modified intention-to-treat basis.\n\n This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.\n\ngov, NCT04353596.\n\n\nFindings\nBetween April 20, 2020, and Jan 20, 2021, 204 patients (median age 75 years [IQR 66–80], 37% females) were randomly assigned to discontinue (n=104) or continue (n=100) RAS inhibition.\n\n Within 30 days, eight (8%) of 104 died in the discontinuation group and 12 (12%) of 100 patients died in the continuation group (p=0·42).\n\n There was no significant difference in the primary endpoint between the discontinuation and continuation group (median [IQR] maximum SOFA score 0·00 (0·00–2·00) vs 1·00 (0·00–3·00); p=0·12).\n\n Discontinuation was associated with a significantly lower AUCSOFA (0·00 [0·00–9·25] vs 3·50 [0·00–23·50]; p=0·040), mean SOFA score (0·00 [0·00–0·31] vs 0·12 [0·00–0·78]; p=0·040), and 30-day SOFA score (0·00 [10–90th percentile, 0·00–1·20] vs 0·00 [0·00–24·00]; p=0·023).\n\n At 30 days, 11 (11%) in the discontinuation group and 23 (23%) in the continuation group had signs of organ dysfunction (SOFA score ?1) or were dead (p=0·017).\n\n There were no

the scientific community on whether the use of renin?angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors in the context of COVID?19 would be beneficial or harmful.\n\n A meta?analysis of eligible studies comparing the occurrence of severe and fatal COVID?19 in infected hypertensive patients who were under treatment with angiotensin?converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) vs no treatment or other antihypertensives was conducted.\n\n\nMethods\nPubMed, Google Scholar, the Cochrane Library, medRxiv and bioRxiv were searched for relevant studies.\n\n Fixed?effects models or random?effects models were used depending on the heterogeneity between estimates.\n\n\nResults and discussion\nA total of eighteen studies with 17 311 patients were included.\n\n The use of RAS inhibitors was associated with a significant 16% decreased risk of the composite outcome (death, admission to intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation requirement or progression to severe or critical pneumonia): RR: 0.84 (95% CI: 0.73?0.95), P = .\n\n007, I2 = 65%.\n\n\nWhat is new and conclusion\nThe results of this pooled analysis suggest that the use of ACEI/ARB does not worsen the prognosis of COVID?19, and could even be protective in hypertensive subjects.\n\n Hypertensive patients should continue these drugs even if they become infected with SARS?CoV?2.\n","id":"PMC7436708","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"John Wiley and Sons

the Risks of Severe COVID-19 and Mortality in COVID-19 Patients With Hypertension: A Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies","abstract":"Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) share a target receptor with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).\n The use of ACEIs/ARBs may cause angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor upregulation, facilitating the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells.\n There is concern that the use of ACEIs/ARBs could increase the risks of severe COVID-19 and mortality.\n The impact of discontinuing these drugs in patients with COVID-19 remains uncertain.\n We aimed to assess the association between the use of ACEIs/ARBs and the risks of mortality and severe disease in patients with COVID-19. A systematic search was performed in PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and MedRxiv.\norg from December 1, 2019, to June 20, 2020. We also identified additional citations by manually searching the reference lists of eligible articles.\n Forty-two observational studies including 63,893 participants were included.\n We found that the use of ACEIs/ARBs was not significantly associated with a reduction in the relative risk of all-cause mortality [odds ratio (OR) = 0.87, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 0.75–1.00; I2 = 57%, p = 0.05].\n We found no significant reduction in the risk of severe disease in the ACEI subgroup (OR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.88–1.02, I2 = 50%, p = 0.18), the ARB subgroup (OR = 1.03, 95% CI = 0.94–1.13, I2 = 62%, p = 0.48), or the ACEI/ARB subgroup (OR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.65–1.08, I2 = 67%, p = 0.16).\n Moreover, seven studies showed no significant difference in the duration of hospitalization between the two groups (mean difference = 0.33, 95% CI = ?1.75 to 2.40, p = 0.76).\n In conclusion, the use of ACEIs/ARBs appears to not have a significant effect on mortality, disease severity, or duration of hospitalization in COVID-19 patients.\n On the basis of the findings of this meta-analysis, there is no support for the cessation of treatment with ACEIs or ARBs in patients with COVID-19.","id":"PMC8107232","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Frontiers Media

(ACEIs) and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) in COVID-19 disease susceptibility, severity, and treatment is unclear.\n\n\nPurpose:\nTo evaluate, on an ongoing basis, whether use of ACEIs or ARBs either increases risk for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection or is associated with worse COVID-19 disease outcomes, and to assess the efficacy of these medications for COVID-19 treatment.\n\n\nData Sources:\nMEDLINE (Ovid) and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from 2003 to 4 May 2020, with planned ongoing surveillance for 1 year; the World Health

Extraction:\nSingle-reviewer abstraction confirmed by another reviewer, independent evaluation by 2 reviewers of study quality, and collective assessment of certainty of evidence.\n\n\nData Synthesis:\nTwo retrospective cohort studies found that ACEI and ARB use was not associated with a higher likelihood of receiving a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result, and 1 case–control study found no association with COVID-19 illness in a large community (moderate-certainty evidence).\n\n Fourteen observational studies, involving a total of 23 565 adults with COVID-19, showed consistent evidence

COVID-19.\nLimitation:\nHalf the studies were small and did not adjust for important confounding variables.\n\n\nConclusion:\nHigh-certainty evidence suggests that ACEI or ARB use is not associated with more severe COVID-19 disease, and moderate-certainty evidence suggests no association between use of these medications and positive SARS-CoV-2 test results among symptomatic patients.\n\n Whether these medications increase the risk for mild or asymptomatic disease or are beneficial in COVID-19 treatment remains uncertain.\n\n\nPrimary Funding Source:\nNone.\n\n (PROSPERO: registration number

cases with COVID-19 on admission at Tongji Hospital from January 10 to February 12, 2020, were collected and analyzed.\n\n The data of laboratory examinations, including peripheral lymphocyte subsets, were analyzed and compared between severe and non-severe patients.\n\n\nResults\nOf the 452 patients with COVID-19 recruited, 286 were diagnosed as severe infection.\n\n The median age was 58 years and 235 were male.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever, shortness of breath, expectoration, fatigue, dry cough and myalgia.\n\n Severe cases tend to have lower lymphocytes counts, higher leukocytes counts and neutrophil-lymphocyte-ratio (NLR), as well as lower percentages of monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils.\n\n Most of severe cases demonstrated elevated levels of infection-related biomarkers and inflammatory cytokines.\n\n The number of T cells significantly decreased, and more hampered in severe cases.\n\n Both helper T cells and suppressor T cells in patients with COVID-19 were below normal levels, and lower level of helper T cells in severe group.\n\n The percentage of naïve helper T cells increased and memory helper T cells decreased in severe cases.\n\n Patients with COVID-19 also have lower level of regulatory T cells, and more obviously damaged in severe cases.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe novel coronavirus might mainly act on lymphocytes, especially T lymphocytes.\n\n Surveillance of NLR and lymphocyte subsets is helpful in the early screening of critical illness, diagnosis and treatment of
