Data shows that, among these measures, the lockdown implemented as of 9 March had a positive impact, in particular the central and southern regions of Italy, while other actions appeared to be less effective. When the true prevalence of a disease is unknown, it is possible estimate it, based on mortality data and the assumptive case-fatality rate of the disease. Given these assumptions, the estimated period-prevalence of COVID-19 in Italy varies from 0.35% in Sicily to 13.3% in Lombardy.\nOn April 7th, 2020, the number of notified COVID-19 cases in Italy is above 135,000, with almost 17,000 deaths. Italy, second only to the US for the number of COVID-19 notified cases, but first for of deaths, is facing an unedited challenge. The epidemic is disproportionately hitting some northern areas, pushing the Italian National Health Service capacity of some areas to their limits.\nLessons from China's successful battle against COVID-19 show how containing measures including cases isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine and mitigation measures, including general lockdown and social (or personal) distancing, seem to have worked.\nAs COVID-19 was first reported in Italy (23rd January 2020), the Government has progressively introduced restrictive measures. The most relevant actions taken by the Government from 25 January to 21 March 2020, are described in Table 1. Prevention measures, taken in late January, such as health-check-points in airports and a flight ban from China, rapidly escalated when the first autochthonous cases were detected in the area of Casalpusterlengo, Castelnuovo d'Adda and Codogno in the Lombardy Region (21 February) (Figure 1).\nHealth protection measures against COVID-19 in Italy, 25 January- 23 March 2020\nDate	Public health measure implemented	Place	Authority	 	25/01	Health checkpoints for passengers coming from China or from areas where one sustained autochthonous transmission of the new Coronavirus has occurred.

Italy	Government	 	\nFirst &quot;Red Zone&quot; Area (February 23rd)\nContainment measures at first had been the self-isolation of infected patients and the creation of a &quot;red-zone&quot; in a limited area. Afterward, the Government strategy changed into a severe mitigation response, up to the lockdown to all the country. Other mass-measures were introduced, such as a strong recommendation to avoid at-risk behaviors and the suspension of all non-essential businesses in the entire nation.\nThe proportion of the infected population in Italy was estimated based on available published Italian data. This preliminary analysis did not consider infections notified within the national surveillance system to avoid biases due to the heterogenous proportion of population tested in different regions. The number of official deaths was considered to be less biased; therefore, we included an adjustment in our model due to the undiagnosed deaths, especially in the first phase of the epidemic. The average increase of 20% in the number of deaths was introduced accordingly to a recent Italian specific report. The adjusted case-fatality rate for Europe (0.85%) was derived considering the averaged estimates of three reports, two carried out in UK and the other in Italy. From these parameters, we obtained a model to estimate the current period prevalence in the general population of the 19 Italian regions and the 2 autonomous provinces (Table 2). These data vary among Italian regions from 0.35% infection proportion in Sicily and Basilicata to 11.2% in the Lombardy region and are a useful tool to inform the planning of further containment measures in different geographical areas.\nPopulation, Number of deaths and estimates of infection period prevalence in the Italian Regions and Autonomous Provinces\nRegions and Autonomous Provinces	Population M (mil)	N. of deaths	Period Prevalence	 	Piemonte (Piedmont)	4.4	1.319	4.3%	 	V.d'Aosta (Aosta Valley)	0.13	100	11.2%	 	Lombardia (Lombardy)	10.1	9.484	13.3%	 	Prov.

If we analyze these trends, we can outline the following, preliminary considerations:\nThe measures to suspend flights from China (which were not adopted by other EU countries) and airports' checkpoints with thermoscan did not have a significant effect in containing the epidemic.\nThe implementation of a &quot;red zone&quot; in Lombardy effectively contained the spread of the infection within that area. On the other hand, the &quot;red zone&quot; measure did not have the same effect outside that area. In fact, three of the neighboring provinces (Bergamo, Brescia, and Piacenza) recorded the highest incidence rates in the weeks following the establishment of the red zones. Perhaps these actions were adopted too late (or considering a too small area) when the virus had already spread for several days without notice of it.\nThe failure to establish a second &quot;red zone&quot; near Bergamo in the Municipalities of Alzano and Nembro (Figure 2), despite the proposal of local authorities (on March 3rd), led to a dramatic outbreak with about 10,000 cases in Bergamo with over 1,000 death toll and similar figures in the neighboring areas (Brescia and Piacenza).\nGeneral mitigation measures seem to be effective to flatten the epidemic curve of new notified infections (Figure 3) with more effect in controlling the epidemic in the central-southern than in the Northern regions.\nMissed &quot;Red Zone&quot; Area (March 3rd), from Regione Lombardia &amp; Corriere della Sera\nTrend of overall new notified cases in Italy (Protezione civile, 7,4,2020)1\nThe difference was in the time when the mass-measures were adopted. At the time of the national lock-down, the central-southern regions only had few circulating cases. Timing appeared to be a crucial factor in determining the effect of mitigation measures (Figure 4).\nEstimate of Period Prevalence of infected people in the Italian regions as at 7 April, 2020\nOverall, containment measures (red zones) and mitigation (general lockdown) can be effective if taken at an early stage of the epidemic ad on large areas. Also, the community management of suspects, contacts, and cases could alleviate hospital burden and perhaps even improve disease prognosis.\nThe post-epidemic phase might benefit from the availability of forthcoming antibody serological tests. The benefit could be substantial for a large part of the country population, but especially central and southern Italy, that would not yet be infected, as shown by our estimates.\nFunding:\nThis paper is a preliminary activity among the EU Project n. 101003562 &quot;Three Rapid Diagnostic tests (Point-of-Care) for COVID-19 Coronavirus, improving epidemic preparedness, and foster public health and socio-economic benefits - CORONADX&quot; (Task 7.1) supported by the Europeam Commission (Horizon 2020, H2020-SC1-PHE-CORONAVIRUS-2020).\nConflict of interest:\nEach author declares that he or she has no commercial associations (e.g. consultancies, stock ownership, equity interest, patent/licensing arrangement etc.) that might pose a conflict of interest in connection with the submitted article\nReferences\nDipartimento della Protezione Civile.

For R0 values of 2·5 or 3·5, if there were 40 initial cases, contact tracing and isolation were only potentially feasible when less than 1% of transmission occurred before symptom onset.\n\n\nInterpretation\nIn most scenarios, highly effective contact tracing and case isolation is enough to control a new outbreak of COVID-19 within 3 months.\n\n The probability of control decreases with long delays from symptom onset to isolation, fewer cases ascertained by contact tracing, and increasing transmission before symptoms.\n\n This model can be modified to reflect updated transmission characteristics and more specific definitions of outbreak control to assess the potential success of local response efforts.\n\n\nFunding\nWellcome Trust, Global Challenges Research Fund, and Health Data Research UK.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7097845","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"The Author(s).

Since then, Italy has become the third most affected country worldwide (128,948 cases, in April 5th) after the United States and has the highest number of deaths due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (15,887 deaths, in April 5th). Meanwhile, Spain is the second most affected in the number of diagnosed cases (130,759) and mortality (12,418).\nSince March 8th, widespread lockdown measures have been in place in Italy. Specific measures restricting social contact were first introduced in the northern regions, where most cases had occurred, then extended to the whole country on March 10th. Furthermore, Italy tightened these measures extending the lockdown on March 21st: all businesses were closed, with the exception of those essential to the country's supply chains. Similarly, Spain imposed a lockdown on March 16th, with social distancing measures similar to those established in Italy. Two weeks later, on March 30th, Spain also implemented a more restrictive lockdown, aimed at reducing the mobility and non-essential industrial activity countrywide.\nThese restrictive measures have mainly been focused on flattening the epidemic curve. Most of the results reported daily by Governments, official agencies, and the media are aimed at describing cumulative epidemic data. Conversely, little attention has been paid to describe, quantify, and compare the lockdown effects within and between countries from an epidemiological point of view using incident data.\nMethods\nWe collected data between February 24th and April 5th from the websites of the Italian and Spanish Ministries of Health. We have analyzed the trends of the daily incident diagnosed cases, deaths, and intensive care units (ICU) admissions for SARS-CoV-2 in Italy and Spain before and during their respective national lockdowns, using an interrupted time-series design. The data was analyzed with quasi-Poisson regression, using an interaction model to estimate the change in trends. The data was analyzed using Stata, release 16 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, 2019).\nResults\nTrends and daily observed incident diagnosed cases, deaths and ICU admissions in Italy and Spain, between February 24th to April 5th.\nFig. 1\nDaily percent increase (%IR) of diagnosed cases, deaths and ICU admission in Italy and Spain, between February 24th and April 5th before and during their national lockdowns.\nTable 1	 	\n	Before lockdown	First lockdowna	Second lockdownb	 	%IR	(95% CI)	%IR	(95% CI)	%IR	(95% CI)	 	Italy							 	 Diagnosed cases	21.6	(16.2, 27.1)	12.5	(9.6, 15.5)	-2.0	(-3.1, -0.9)	 	 Deaths	32.8	(21.0, 44.6)	13.7	(10.1, 17.4)	-0.2	(-1.5, 1.0)	 	 ICU admissions	16.7	(10.3, 23.2)	3.7	(-0.6, 8.0)	-16.8	(-20.2, -13.4)	 	Spain							 	 Diagnosed cases	38.5	(27.0, 50.0)	11.9	(9.5, 14.3)	-2.7	(-7.3, 1.9)	 	 Deaths	59.3	(23.0, 95.2)	17.6	(14.4, 20.7)	-1.8	(-5.0, 3.1)	 	 ICU admissions	26.5	(0.4, 52.5)	9.6	(4.7, 14.7)	-5.6	(-24.4, 6.9)	 	\nFirst lockdown in Italy between March 10th and March 21th; and in Spain between March 16th and March 30th.\nSecond and more restrictive lockdown in Italy since March 21th; and in Spain since March 30th.\n Fig. 1 shows the observed daily incident data and the estimated trend slopes for Italy and Spain since February 24th. Before the lockdown, the daily percent increase of all the incidence outcomes was higher in Spain (38.5% for diagnosed cases, 59.3% for deaths, and 26.5% for ICU admissions) than in Italy (21.6%, 32.8%, and 16.7%, respectively) (Table 1 ). During the first lockdown period, both countries show similar daily trends (12.5%, 13.7%, and 3.7% in Italy; and 11.9%, 17.6%, and 9.6% in Spain). Thus, during the first lockdown the daily increase in incident data was considerably reduced. In Italy, the diagnosed cases decreased by 42.1%, deaths by 58.2%, and ICU admissions by 77.8%. This reduction was even higher in Spain, where the diagnosed cases decreased by 69.1%, deaths by 77.8%, and ICU admissions by 66.8%. However, although the slopes have been flattened for all outcomes, the trends kept rising (Fig. 1).\nDuring the second and more restrictive lockdown, currently ongoing, both countries show some positive signs, indicating that trends may be changing (Fig. 1). Specifically, in Italy all outcomes start declining; diagnosed cases if -2.0%, daily deaths of -0.2%, and ICU admissions of -16.8%. Similarly, Spain also shows decline trends in daily diagnosed cases of -2.7%, deaths of -1.8%, and ICU of -5.6%.\nDiscussion\nLockdown, including restricted social contact and keeping open only those businesses essential to the country's supply chains, has had a beneficial effect in both countries. The trend slopes were considerably reduced for all the outcomes. However, this was not enough to change the rising trend of the epidemic. For this reason, more restrictive actions were suggested. The second lockdown, still ongoing, shows how the trends have changed, with a reduction of daily incident cases, deaths, and more significantly in ICUs. These are of similar magnitude in both countries, although Italy carries a week ahead of Spain. However, mortality still shows a small increase, probably because it follows incidence trends with a delay of 1-2 weeks. We should acknowledge that this figures could change during forthcoming weeks.\nAnalysis of trends using daily incident data may be a useful complement to more conventional approaches used to monitor the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic by testing and reporting changes overtime after a public health intervention (i.e., lockdown, confinement or quarantine). Interrupted time-series regression models are relatively easy to implement using readily available data by health authorities. This is a descriptive analysis without predictive purposes. For an easy interpretation, and comparison of the effectiveness of lockdown measures between countries, a linear trend is assumed before and during the lockdown periods. The changes in the definition of diagnosed cases have not been taken into account, nor has the reduction in the susceptible population because of the lockdown. Therefore, the incident cases are modeled directly instead of the incidence rate, assuming that the entire population is at risk.\nTimely indications for public health authorities and governments are essential to slow down the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and relieve the pressure on overburdened health services. Although available data is still limited, and findings must be interpreted with caution, we believe that real-time detection of pattern changes are essential to evaluate the current measures of control and design future ones. In this sense, the positive signs already shown by the decreasing trend slopes after a more restrictive lockdown in Italy and Spain could indicate an optimistic and encouraging forecast for those countries that in late March also announced restrictive lockdown measures for flattening the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic curve (e.g., the United Kingdom on March 23th or Ireland on March 27th). These results show that the sacrifices that our society is making are gaining us valuable time, which is essential to get ready to face the future pressures that this epidemic will bring forth.\nDeclaration of competing interest\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.\nReferences\nInterrupted time series regression for the evaluation of public health interventions: a tutorial\nDipartamento della Protezione Civille 2020.

We aim to evaluate the effectiveness of mass testing, lockdown, or a combination of both to control COVID-19 pandemic. A systematic search on 11 major databases was conducted on June 8, 2020. This review is registered in Prospero (CRD420201 90546). We included primary studies written in English which investigate mass screening, lockdown, or a combination of both to control and/or mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic. There are four important outcomes as selected by WHO experts for their decision- making process: incident cases, onward transmission, mortality, and resource use. Among 623 studies, only 14 studies met our criteria. Four observational studies were rated as strong evidence and ten modelling studies were rated as moderate evidence. Based on one modelling study, mass testing reduced the total infected people compared to no mass testing.

A limited evidence showed that a combination of lockdown and mass screening resulted in a greater reduction of incidence and mortality rate compared to lockdown only. However, there is not enough evidence on the effectiveness of mass testing only.\nSignificance for public health\nAs of the end of June 2020, an effective pharmacological intervention or vaccine for COVID-19 is not yet available. Thus, public health measures have become the key measures in containing the outbreak. To our best knowledge, this is the first systematic review on the comparison of mass screening and lockdown effectiveness in controlling COVID-19 pandemic. From our extensive review, we found out that lockdown was consistently effective in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, a combination of lockdown and mass screening resulted in a greater reduction of incidence and mortality rate of COVID-19 compared to lockdown only but resulted in a similar mortality rate compared to mass screening only. However, there is still no clear guideline or recommendation about the public health interventions to date. This systematic review can be an essential consideration in the policy making in the COVID-19 affected countries.\nIntroduction\nCOVID-19 is a highly infectious disease caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus is transmitted from human to human through droplets produced when sick people cough or sneeze. SARS-CoV-2 causes viral pneumonia which may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Severe cases and death are more common in individuals with underlying comorbidities such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, or diabetes mellitus.\nAs of the early of June 2020, an effective pharmacological intervention or vaccine for COVID-19 is not yet available. Thus, public health measures including quarantine, isolation, and massive screening become the main measures in containing the outbreak. Quarantine and/or mass screening have been applied in several countries. Two studies conducted in China, reported that utilizing both quarantine and isolation was an effective control measure to decrease the peak number of COVID-19 infections, slow down the time of peak infections, and reduce the reproductive number of the virus. Singapore and South Korea used several control measures including early detection by means of surveillance and aggressive contact tracing. For surveillance systems, Singapore has scaled up SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR laboratory testing capacity with 2,200 tests held in a day within a 5.7 million population. The control measures have been successful in containing the spread of the virus in Singapore since the increase of cases does not exhibit exponential growth. South Korea implemented mass SARS-CoV-2 testing, linked to contact tracing, and self-isolation. These interventions led to a reduction of daily new cases from 284 new cases on February 26, 2020 to 84 new cases on March 17, 2020.\nThe implementation of such public health strategies has sparked some discussion on which strategy is the most effective and cost efficient to prevent infectious diseases. In this systematic review, we aim to analyze the effectiveness of lockdown, mass testing, or a combination of both in reducing the incidence, onward transmission, and mortality due to COVID-19, also the resource use analysis of each strategy.\nMethods\nProtocol and registration\nThis systematic review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. We conducted a systematic review on the effectiveness of mass screening and/or lockdown to control the coronavirus outbreaks. This systematic review is registered in Prospero (CRD42020190546).\nEligibility criteria for inclusion of studies\nWe included non-randomized studies of interventions as the best available empirical evidence. In addition, we also included modelling studies, as empirical studies were not yet available. Cohort studies, case-control studies, time series, interrupted time series, and case series were also included. We excluded case reports and systematic review. The references of systematic reviews were carefully reviewed.\nPopulation\nThe target population are the community population of countries which implemented mass screening and lockdown to mitigate and/or control the COVID-19 pandemic. We also included studies on SARS, MERS, and other influenza epidemic or pandemic as indirect evidence. We included all countries regardless of the prevalence rate.\nIntervention\nIntervention measures included mass screening, lockdown, a combination of both, or in combination with other physical measures, e.g. physical distancing, hand hygiene, isolation, school measures/ closures, workplace measures / closures. We decided to only include mass screening with molecular test, such as RT-PCR and other nucleic acid amplification tests, which is the gold standard for the confirmation of COVID-19 diagnosis. Lockdown is a temporary condition imposed by governmental authorities (e.g. during emergency) in which people are required to stay in their homes and refrain from or limit activities outside the home involving public contact. Individuals who work in the essential occupational fields (e.g. healthcare, public works, law enforcement, and food supply) to public health and safety may continue working during a lockdown. We excluded travel- and border-related screening and measures.\nControl\nWe had two types of controls which were: 1) community population before being involved in any of the physical measures, and 2) community population in which no physical measure was implemented for control and/or mitigation of the epidemic or pandemic and only routine care was provided for the infected people.\nOutcomes\nThere are four important outcomes as selected by WHO experts for their decision-making process: incident cases, onward transmission, mortality, and resource use. Incidence rate is reported separately for suspect, probable, and confirmed case as defined by WHO. Onward transmission could be described by both the basic reproduction number (R0), which is the expected number of individuals infected by one confirmed individual when he or she enters a fully susceptible population, and the doubling time, which is the number of days for total cases to double at the current growth rate. Resource use included the analysis of direct and indirect costs (e.g. test kits, personal protective equipment, pay cut) for the implementation of each strategy.\nInformation sources and search strategy\nTwo authors independently conducted a systematic search of the literature published in English up until June 8, 2020 in Cochrane Library, Directory of Open Access Journals, CINAHL, MEDLINE, Proquest, Pubmed, Sage Journals, Science Direct, Scopus, World Health Organization (WHO) Global Index Mediscus, and Wiley. These following keywords were used in Cochrane Library, Directory of Open Access Journals, EBSCO (CINAHL, MEDLINE), Proquest, Pubmed, Sage, Scopus, WHO Global Index Mediscus, and Wiley: ((screening) OR (mass screening) OR (rapid screening) OR (rapid molecular test) OR (rapid molecular assay) OR (GeneXpert)) AND (quarantine OR lockdown) AND (coronavirus OR (COVID-19) OR (MERS-CoV) OR (MERS) OR (SARS-CoV) OR (SARS) OR influenza) AND infection. Meanwhile, for ScienceDirect, we used these following keywords: ((screening) OR (rapid molecular test)) AND (quarantine OR lockdown) AND (coronavirus OR (COVID-19) OR (MERS) OR (SARS)) AND infection. The filter &quot;abstract&quot; was applied to CINAHL, MEDLINE, Sage Journals, and Wiley; the filter &quot;abstract&quot; and &quot;scholarly journals&quot; were applied to Proquest; the filter &quot;title, abstract, or keywords&quot; was applied to ScienceDirect and Scopus; the filter &quot;title, abstract, or subject&quot; was applied to WHO Global Index Mediscus; and the filter &quot;all fields&quot; was applied to Cochrane Library, Directory of Open Access Journals, and Pubmed. No limitation of years used in the searching.\nBesides the extensive searching, authors NJ and HC independently screened reference lists of relevant systematic reviews and included relevant studies. Clinical trial registers (clinical trials.gov) and preprint databases (such as medRxiv, bioRxiv, and arvix.org) were also reviewed carefully.\nStudy selection\nThe search results were imported to the Mendeley program to manage the studies and remove the duplicates. Two authors independently screened all the titles and abstracts to retrieve eligible studies. The authors then retrieved the full texts of all included abstracts and screened all full-text publications independently. In each stage of screening, any disagreement about eligibility will be discussed with a third author until an agreement was reached. The PRISMA flow diagram was used to report the screening and selection results.\nData extraction\nThe required information from each full-text were extracted data into a standardized table separately by two authors and crosschecked for completeness and correctness. For cohort studies, the data items were author, publication year, country, study design, objective, characteristics of study participants, description of intervention, description of control, important confounding factors, and results. The data items for modelling studies were author, year, type of model, setting, time, data source and participants, interventions, and results. If there is any unclear or incomplete data in the full-text was found, authors will attempt to contact the author of the original report to provide the details. Any discrepancies will be resolved by discussion, referring to the relevant study paper. If resolution is not possible, however, a third author, who is not involved in the extraction process, will be consulted.\nRisk of bias assessment of included studies\nTwo authors independently appraised the risk of bias for each eligible study using the modified quality assessment tools from Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP). The assessed domains included selection bias, study design, confounders, blinding, data collection methods, withdrawals and drop-outs, and global rating. Raters rated the individual domains as strong, moderate, or weak quality which was translated to low risk, low risk*, or high risk of bias. Disagreements among the raters was solved by discussion with a third author.\nData synthesis\nOnly studies with moderate and strong global rating (based on the EPHPP bias assessment tools) were included to prevent any bias from poor quality studies. The minimum number of studies for each outcome measure to be deemed eligible for analysis was two.\nDescriptive synthesis\nThe study location, study design, intervention, and control of each included study were arranged in a summary table. The results of each included study were described in another summary table. Frequencies of each outcome measures were reported to find any pattern in relation to the context of the measures.\nQuantitative synthesis\nBoth random effects and fixed effect data pooling will be conducted, if applicable. Subgroup analysis will be conducted for the types of intervention combinations, if the data is available.\nResults\nStudy selection\nThe searching process done on June 8, 2020 is demonstrated in Figure 1. We excluded a total of 20 papers: 9 papers were not a research study (a review, letter to editor, or narrative text), 2 papers did not have the correct population (the studies were done in highrisk people only), 9 papers had improper intervention/control (such as quarantine, isolation, contact tracing, and many other physical measures without implementing either mass screening or lockdown).\nStudy characteristics\nOur searches identified 14 relevant studies,,12, all of these focused on COVID-19. There were 10 modelling studies, , 3 retrospective cohort studies, and 1 time series analysis, covering 8 countries (China, France, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom, United States, Russia, and Indonesia) from 3 continents. We could not identify any similar studies on SARS, MERS, or other influenza virus infection as indirect evidence. We also could not identify any study on the cost effectiveness of mass screening, lockdown, and a combination of both. Due to the heterogeneity of the study designs and effect measures, we could not continue with data pooling and only conducted systematic qualitative review. The characteristics of included studies are described in Table 1.\nSearching diagram.\nRisk of bias of included studies\nBased on the EPHPP bias assessment tool, we rated all 4 observational studies as strong evidence. Of the modelling studies, we rated all 10 modelling studies as moderate evidence, the detailed assessment is illustrated in Table 2.\nResults of individual studies\nThe summary of results of each study is presented in Table 3. The detailed characteristics of included studies is presented in Appendix 1.\nSynthesis of results\nMass testing\nWe could identify one modelling study on mass screening effectiveness compared to no mass testing. The mass testing method modeled by Taipale et al. was weekly mass testing on day 20-100 after the first 100 cases were identified in a population of 10000 people. Taipale et al. projected that mass testing would reduce the total infected people from 80% (with no mass testing) to 20% of the total population. Moreover, the mortality rate also reduced significantly from 0.66% (no mass testing) to 0.19% with mass testing.\nLockdown\nThere was a total of 10 studies reporting the effectiveness of lockdown. There is a consistent evidence that lockdown was effective in reducing the number of new infected cases, except for one modelling study by Taipale et al. which predicted that 80% of the total population would be infected either with or without lockdown. Relaxing lockdown will result in a higher suspected, quarantined, and confirmed cases. Other than that, delaying lockdown also resulted in a higher total of cases.\nCharacteristics of included studies.\nArticle reference (First author, year)	Study location	Study design	Intervention	Control	 	Dolbeault et al., 2020	France	SEIR modelling study	Lockdown A: a big single group Lockdown B: a majority of population under lockdown + a minority (2% of the population) with higher social interaction than before lockdown, i.e. health workers	Before lockdown	 	Gongalsky et al., 2020	Moscow, London, New York	SEIAR modelling study	Mass group RT-PCR testing (5000 tests/ big city) Rapid isolation of superspreaders Quarantine Schools and universities are closed Offices, trains, and groceries are partially quarantined Non-essential workers work remotely	No mass testing	 	Hoertel et al., 2020	France	Stochastic agent-based micro-simulation modelling study	Lockdown: 8 weeks and 16 weeks Post-lockdown social distancing, mask usage, extra protection for vulnerable population, quarantine, contact tracing, molecular tests for all contacts	No lockdown	 	Hou et al., 2020	Wuhan	SEIR modelling study	Lockdown	No lockdown	 	Ji et al., 2020	Hubei	Retrospective cohort study	Lockdown Real-time syndromic surveillance, health screening, quarantine, social isolation, compulsory outdoor mask usage, monitoring, reporting	Before lockdown	 	Lau et al., 2020	China	Retrospective cohort study	Lockdown Change in diagnostic criteria	Before lockdown	 	Putra et al., 2020	Indonesia	SEIR modelling study	Lockdown (implemented on the last week of March 2020)	Before lockdown	 	Rao et al., 2020	U.S.	Model based predictions	Lockdown in several states (implemented by the end of March 2020)	Before lockdown	 	Signorelli et al., 2020	Italy	Modelling study	Lockdown (started on March 9, 2020)	Mass testing only	 	Taipale et al., 2020	-	Standard SEIR modelling study	Scenario A1: mass testing on day 20-100 and self-quarantine of infected individuals Scenario A2: no lockdown, no mass testing Scenario B1: lockdown on day 20-100, mass testing after day 100 Scenario B2: lockdown on day 20-100, no mass testing	Lockdown only	 	Tang et al., 2020	Hubei	SEIR modelling study	Lockdown	Before lockdown	 	Tellis et al., 2020	U.S.	Retrospective cohort study	Lockdown	No lockdown	 	Tobias, 2020	Italy and Spain	Interrupted time-series analysis	Lockdown	Before lockdown	 	Zhao et al., 2020	Wuhan, Hubei, and China	SUQC modelling study	Lockdown and other preventive measures	Before lockdown	 	\nSEIR, suspected, exposed, infected, recovered; SEIAR, suspected, exposed, infected, admitted, recovered; RT-PCR, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; SUQC, susceptible, un-quarantine infected, quarantine infected, confirmed infected.\nFive studies were consistent in reporting that lockdown was an effective strategy for reducing onward transmission of COVID-19. Dolbeault et al., Zhao et al., Tang et al., Putra et al. all reported that lockdown resulted in a reduction of reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2, ranging from 1.5-10 before lockdown to 0.0792-3 after lockdown.\nLockdown could also lower the mortality due to COVID- 19. Tobias presented that 2 weeks of lockdown lowered the daily mortality rate by 41.7 to 9.1%. According to Hoertel et al., the cumulative mortality was 30% lower with lockdown compared to no lockdown. However, Taipale et al. predicted that there would only be a slight difference of the number of deaths between lockdown and no lockdown, 0.57% and 0.66% respectively. The reduction of daily mortality rate can be enhanced by tightening lockdown.\nCombination of mass testing and lockdown\nCompared to only lockdown, the addition of mass testing to lockdown has shown some promising results. A modeling study by Taipale et al. showed that the addition of mas testing to lockdown successfully reduced the number of infected people from 80% to 20% and the mortality rate from 0.57% to 0.16% compared to only lockdown. Taipale and colleagues used a lockdown scheme for day 20-100 after the first case was discovered, followed by a weekly mass testing of a random part of the population after day 100. However, there is no significant different in terms of the total infected people (2,000 people vs 2,000 people) and mortality rate (0.19% and 0.16%) between mass testing and the combination of mass testing and lockdown. The incidence in mass testing only is 200 new cases/ day until around day 80, while the combination of lockdown and mass testing resulted in around 125 new cases/ day from day 100-150 (or after the mass testing began) and significantly reduced thereafter.\nDiscussion\nControl measures including lockdown and massive testing strategy are conducted in many countries around the world as a response to COVID-19 outbreak. To our best knowledge, this is the first systematic review comparing the mass screening and lockdown effectiveness in controlling COVID-19 pandemic. The evidence is still very limited as 6 out of the 14 included studies are preprint and 10 out of the 14 included studies are modelling studies, made based on limited data sets and predicted assumptions. Most of the studies did not take into account the heterogeneity of infectiousness, incubation period, and recovery time, immunity of recovered patients, deceased patients, various social interactions, age structure, and many other contributing factors.\nMass testing\nWe could only identify a modeling study on the clinical effectiveness of solely weekly mass testing to mitigate COVID-19. Taipale et al. projected that mass testing would drastically reduce the total infected people from 80% to 20% of the total population. Moreover, the mortality rate also reduced significantly from 0.66% to 0.19% with mass testing. The mass testing method used was the weekly mass testing on day 20-100 after the first 100 cases were identified in a population of 10,000 people.\nTaipale et al. also compared the effectiveness of several mass testing techniques. Testing everyone at the same time is the best strategy to control an outbreak, followed by testing everyone in a certain period and last by a random sampling. In reality, due to limited tests and manpower, the preferable option could be testing everyone in a certain period, e.g. geographical sweep where infected individuals are prevented from crossing to other areas. In lowresource settings, random sampling might be the only possible way. This method is less efficient than testing part of the population in a certain period because some individuals are tested twice, while some not at all. This method will miss some infected individuals. However, in order to put an outbreak under control, the most important thing is to make sure that the generation of new cases per current case is less than one or the reproductive number remains less than one.\nRisk of bias assessment using EPHPP (Effective Public Healthcare Panacea Project) tools.\nFirst author, year	Selection bias	Study design	Confounders	Blinding	Data collection method	Withdrawals and dropouts	Global rating	 	Dolbeault et al., 2020	+++	+	+++	Can't tell	Can't tell	++	++	 	Gongalsky et al., 2020	+++	+	+++	Can't tell	Can't tell	++	++	 	Hoertel et al., 2020	+++	+	+++	Can't tell	Can't tell	++	++	 	Hou et al.,3 2020	+++	+	+++	Can't tell	Can't tell	++	++	 	Ji et al., 2020	+++	++	+++	++	+++	+++	+++	 	Lau et al., 2020	+++	++	+++	++	+++	+++	+++	 	Putra et al., 2020	+++	+	+++	Can't tell	Can't tell	++	++	 	Rao et al., 2020	+++	+	+++	Can't tell	Can't tell	++	++	 	Signorelli et al., 2020	+++	+	+++	Can't tell	Can't tell	++	++	 	Taipale et al., 2020	+++	+	+++	Can't tell	Can't tell	++	++	 	Tang et al., 2020	+++	+	+++	Can't tell	Can't tell	++	++	 	Tellis et al., 2020	+++	+	+++	Can't tell	Can't tell	++	++	 	Tobias, 2020	+++	++	+++	++	+++	+++	+++	 	Zhao et al., 2020	+++	++	+++	++	+++	+++	+++	 	\n+++, strong; ++, moderate; +, weak.\nResults summary of included studies.\nOutcome	Number of studies	Outcome summary	 	Incidence	Mass testing1 modeling study (Taipale et al.)	Mass testingTaipale et al.Taipale modeled a weekly mass testing of a random part of the population (10,000 people) on day 20-100 after the first case was found.This type of mass testing would effectively reduce the number of infected people compared to no mass testing, 2,000 infected people vs 8,000 infected people respectively.	 		Lockdown9 modelling studies (Dolbeault et al.; Hoertel et al.; Hou et al.; Rao et al.; Signorelli et al.; Taipale et al.; Tang et al.; Tellis et al.; Zhao et al.), 1 retrospective cohort study (Ji et al.), and 1 time series analysis (Tobias)	LockdownDolbeault et al.A total lockdown resulted in a reduction of the number of infected people (4% to 1%) compared to before lockdown.Lockdown with a minority (2%) of the population having an increased social interaction (i.e. health workers, supermarket cashiers) resulted in a decrease of infected people (4% to 2%) compared to before lockdown. However, almost all individuals (81%) of the minority group got infected.	 		Lockdown and mass testing2 modelling studies (Gongalsky et al.; Taipale et al.)	Hoertel et al.Both 8- and 16-week lockdowns resulted in a reduction of cumulative incidence ( 10%). An 8-week lockdown followed by mandatory post quarantine social distancing and mask usage reduced the cumulative incidence by  35%, adding extra protection for the most vulnerable population (aged &gt;=65 or having at least one comorbidity) until the pandemic ends (calculated to be on week 38th) to these resulted in a  60% reduction compared to no lockdown and adequate in preventing a second epidemic wave.Hou et al.Reduction of contact rate by strict isolation and quarantine can effectively decrease the peak number of COVID-19 infections, but may postpone the peak time of infections.Ji et al.In Huangshi, right after Jan 24, 2020 (day 1 of lockdown), the epidemic curve flattened. Feb 1, 2020 (day 9 of lockdown) was the peak of total COVID-19 cases.No new cases were detected after Feb 26, 2020 (day 34 of lockdown). After 48 days of lockdown, the lockdown was lifted and normal life can continue.Rao et al.Adherence rate of lockdown and other preventive measures was important in determining the effectiveness of lockdown. A complete lockdown in the U.S. or 2 months could lower the daily new cases of COVID-19 by 72-85% compared to prior to lockdown. If 10% of the unidentified susceptible and 20% of the unidentified infected do not adhere to lockdown, the daily new cases would rise to 172-190% of the daily new cases before lockdown.Moreover, an adherence rate of only 50% would result in over 500,000 cases by the end of June.Signorelli et al.The timing of lockdown appeared to be a crucial factor in determining its effectiveness on mitigating new cases. The lockdown in Italy was more effective in theCentral-Southern region than in the Northern regions because they implemented the lockdown early when there were only a few cases.The highest new notified cases were estimated to be 6,500 cases on day 13 of lockdown, followed by a decrease.Taipale et al.Taipale predicted that the number of infected people would not differ between lockdown and no lockdown as 80% of the population would be infected at the end.Tang et al.Relaxing the lockdown and other intervention measures will result in a higher suspected, quarantined, and confirmed cases, thus postpone the epidemic peak.Tellis et al.As of May 1, 2020, delaying lockdown for a week increased the total cases by 8-32%. Without lockdown, the total case increased by 45-128%.TobiasAfter around 2 weeks of lockdown, the daily confirmed cases in Italy reduced from 21.6% to 12.5%. In Spain, it dropped from 38.5% to 11.9% in 2 weeks. After that, Italy and Spain tightened their lockdowns. After 2 weeks of stricter lockdown, the daily confirmed cases in Italy went down to -2.0%. After a week of stricter lockdown in Spain, it went down to -2.7%. Both countries succeeded in putting the COVID-19 pandemic under control.Zhao et al.24Strengthening lockdown would reduce the total number of infected people. Increasing the quarantine rate from 0.4 to 0.6 reduced the number of infected people from 63,000 to 50,000 cases in Wuhan.Lockdown and mass testingGongalsky et al.Identifying and isolating superspreaders in cities conducting strong quarantine (London and New York City) led to a 4.5-to-4.8-fold decrease in the number of infected populations. In cities with weak quarantine (Moscow) an 8-fold decrease in the number of infected populations was found.Taipale et al.Taipale compared lockdown and mass testing to lockdown only. The addition of mass testing to lockdown successfully reduced the number of infected people from 80% to 20%.	 	Onward transmission	Lockdown4 modelling studies (Dolbeaut et al.; Putra et al.; Tang et al.; Zhao et al.) and 1 retrospective cohort (Lau et al.)	LockdownDolbeault et al.The basic reproduction rate was reduced from 2.33 before lockdown to 1.37 during lockdown. However, the outbreak peak was delayed from day 40 to day 105 with lockdownThe end of the outbreak was also delayed from day 90 to day 200 with lockdown.Lau et al.Lockdown was associated with a decrease in the COVID-19 growth rate, shown by an increase of doubling time of total COVID-19cases from 2 days before lockdown to 4 days during the lockdown in China.Putra et al.Lockdown reduced the basic reproduction number from 10 to around 3 in 3 weeks in Indonesia.Tang et al.Lockdown on January 23, 2020 resulted in reduction of reproductive number of COVID-19 in Hubei from 6.39 to 0.28 and China from 6.00 to 0.08 on February 9, 2020(day 18 of lockdown).Zhao et al.The reduction of the reproductive number of COVID-19 is proportionally related to the strictness level of quarantine. This is illustrated by a reduction of reproductivenumber of COVID-19 in Wuhan from 4.71 to 0.75, Hubei (excluding Wuhan) from 5.93 to 0.61, and China (excluding Hubei) from 1.53 to 0.58 with moderately strictquarantine. By implementing a stricter lockdown, Wuhan could further decrease the basic reproduction number to 0.48.	 				 	Mortality	Mass testing 1 modeling study (Taipale et al.)	Mass testingTaipale et al.Taipale predicted that weekly mass testing on day 20-100 after the first 100 cases were identified would result in a lower mortality rate compared to no mass testing, 0.19% and 0.66%, respectively.	 		Lockdown2 modelling studies (Hoertel et al.; Taipale et al.) and 1 time series analysis (Tobias)	LockdownHoertel et al.16The cumulative mortality was 30% lower with either 8- or 16 week-lockdown compared to no lockdown. In addition to the lockown, when a post-quarantine social distancing was applied, the reduction would be 46%. Furthermore, if it was combined with mandatory mask usage, there would be 73% reduction compared to no lockdown. Giving extra protection for the most vulnerable population (aged &gt;=65 or having at least one comorbidity) until the end of pandemic (week 38th) resulted in a 90% reduction compared to no lockdown.	 		Lockdown and mass testing1 modeling studies (Taipale et al.)	Taipale et al.Taipale predicted that lockdown on day 20-100 after the first 100 cases were found resulted in a lower number of death cases compared to no lockdown, 0.57% and 0.66%, respectively.TobiasAfter around 2 weeks of lockdown, the daily mortality cases of COVID-19 in Italy reduced from 21.6% to 12.5%. In Spain, it went down from 59.3% to 17.6% in 2 weeks. Thereafter, Italy and Spain tightened their lockdowns. After around 2 weeks of stricter loc down in Italy, the daily mortality cases went further down to -2.0%. Meanwhile, in Spain, after a week of stricter lockdown, it went further down from 17.6% to -1.8%, putting the COVID-19 pandemic under control in both countries.Lockdown and mass testingTaipale et al.Taipale compared lockdown on day 20-100 after the first 100 cases were found and lockdown with weekly mass testing of a random part of the population. Lockdown folowed by mass testing resulted in a lower mortality rate compared to only mass testing and only lockdown, 0.16%, 0.19%, 0.57% respectively.	 	\nOn the cost effectiveness of mass testing, we could not find any relevant study comparing no mass testing with mass testing. However, we found two modelling studies comparing the cost effectiveness of mass group testing and mass individual testing.  These modelling studies consistently showed that mass group testing for COVID-19 using RT-PCR could be a much cheaper alternative to mass individual testing with the same or even higher level of sensitivity, especially in low prevalence (&lt;=1%) areas. The group size is inversely related to the prevalence ratio, as it allows a bigger group size. This could be the solution for the extensive strain on global supply chains for molecular test reagents.\nLockdown\nGiven that COVID-19 is known to spread mostly by direct or close contact between humans, there is a clear rationale for preventing contact between infectious and susceptible people. With a long incubation period (up to 14 days), there would be a lot of asymptomatic people and thus it is hard to isolate asymptomatic people from susceptible populations. Even though transmission by asymptomatic individuals is much less likely than those who develop symptoms, lockdown puts everyone in quarantine and leaves no or minimum risk of community transmission.\nWe found consistent but low-quality evidence related to lockdown effectiveness in reducing the onward transmission of SARSCoV2. A SEIR modelling study by Tang et al., showed that lockdown drastically decreased the effective reproductive number from &gt;6 to &lt;1 only in 8 days in China and 10 days in Hubei, putting the outbreak under control. Similar result was shown by another modeling study in Wuhan, Hubei, and China. Zhao et al. stated that a stricter lockdown resulted in a greater reduction of reproductive number. However, other SEIR modelling studies in France and Indonesia showed that lockdown alone was unable to lower the reproductive number to below 1. The reduced effectiveness of lockdown in the modelling study by Dolbeault et al. might be caused by the loose lockdown implemented. Meanwhile, in a modelling study by Putra et al., the reproductive number was significantly reduced from 10 to 3 in 3 weeks and stayed the same for the next 3 weeks, but the lockdown method was not clearly described.\nAll relevant studies,14,16,17,20,21,23, predicted that lockdown would decrease the daily new and total confirmed cases compared to before or no lockdown, except for one modelling study by Taipale et al. which predicted that 80% of the total population would be infected either with or without lockdown. The lockdown illustrated by Taipale et al. was lockdown from day 20-100 after the first 100 cases were detected without any preventive measures after day 100. Most studies predicted that the peak time of infection would occur earlier, except for Dolbeault et al. and Hou et al. who predicted that it would be delayed.\nFor the duration of lockdown, the included studies studied a wide variety of lockdown duration (14 days to 200 days). Some studies also did not mention the lockdown duration, some of it might be due to the persistent lockdown that was still taking place at the time of the study. A 2-week lockdown successfully reduced the daily confirmed and mortality cases in Italy and Spain by 42-69% and 58-70%, respectively. However, this study described that an addition of 1-2 weeks of stricter quarantine is needed to halt the increase of daily confirmed cases or to eliminate the COVID-19 pandemic. Ji et al. reported another successful COVID-19 lockdown in controlling the pandemic. After 34 days of complete lockdown in Huangshi, Hubei, there was no new COVID-19 case. The lockdown was lifted on day 48 and the normal life has been continued. Hoertel et al. showed that a minimum of an 8 week of lockdown should be commenced, followed by post quarantine social distancing, mask usage, and extra protection for vulnerable populations until the end of the pandemic was enough to prevent a second pandemic wave. The duration of lockdown should be determined by considering the effective reproduction number, daily new confirmed cases, daily death cases, and the public adherence of other preventive measures. Relaxing or lifting lockdown too early would lead to a second pandemic wave and delay the epidemic peak.\nThe timing of lockdown also plays an important role in determining the lockdown effectiveness. Tellis et al. showed that delaying a lockdown for a week resulted in an 8-32% increase of total COVID-19 cases in the United States. Executing lockdown as early as possible is essential to contain the transmission and avoid nationwide outbreaks.\nOther than timing, the strictness of quarantine was also an important factor. Dolbeault et al., Rao et al., Tang et al., Tobias, and Zhao et al. demonstrated that the stricter the quarantine, the lower the reproduction number and the total number of infected people would be. Dolbeault et al. demonstrated that even by allowing a minority (2%) of the population having a higher social interaction level than before lockdown (e.g. health care workers, supermarket cashiers), the total infected population would be higher than in a complete lockdown situation, 2% and 1% respectively. Furthermore, 81% of the minority group would be infected. This highlights the importance of adequate prevention measures on individuals with a high level of social interactions. Rao et al. also illustrated that if only 50% of the public adhere to lockdown and other preventive measures implemented by the end of March, the daily new cases in June would be over 500,000 cases or 17 times the average new COVID-19 cases in April (29,000 cases/ day). This would quickly lead to a disastrous overcapacity of the national or even international health system. On the other hand, if a complete lockdown was taken place, it could lower the daily new cases to 4,300-8,000 cases in May, slowly eliminating the pandemic.\nCombination of lockdown and mass screening\nCompared to only lockdown, the addition of mass testing to lockdown has shown some promising results. A modeling study by Taipale et al. showed that the addition of mas testing to lockdown successfully reduced the number of infected people from 80% to 20% and the mortality rate from 0.57% to 0.16% compared to only lockdown. Taipale et al. used a lockdown scheme for day 20-100 after the first case was discovered, followed by a weekly mass testing of a random part of the population after day 100. However, there is no significant different in terms of the total infected people (2,000 people vs 2,000 people) and mortality rate (0.19% and 0.16%) between mass testing and the combination of mass testing and lockdown. The incidence in mass testing only is 200 new cases/ day until around day 80, while the combination of lockdown and mass testing resulted in a 125 new cases/ day from day 100-150 and significantly reduced after that.\nAs we can see from the modeling study by Taipale et al., lockdown alone is not adequate in controlling the pandemic as it resulted in a high number of infected people and mortality rate. Without an extensive public screening, pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission cannot be prevented, especially among the essential workers (e.g. health care workers, supermarket cashiers). In a large UK teaching hospital, around 3% of health care workers who did not have any symptom at the time of the sampling was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and the viral genome sequencing showed that the majority of HCWs had the same dominant linage, showing that pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission as a possible way of transmission. These essential workers might further spread the infection to their families.\nThe extent of lockdown and capacity of mass testing also influenced the effectiveness of these interventions on flattening the incidence and mortality curve, as illustrated by Mahajan et al. This study showed that with the same number of tests per day, the stricter the lockdown is, the greater the reduction of confirmed, active, and total death cases. This study also illustrated that with the same level of lockdown, the higher the daily number of tests done per day (8,000 vs 4,000 increase of tests per day, saturated at 300,000 and 200,000 tests/ day respectively) would result in lower number of confirmed, active, and total death cases. The relaxation of lockdown increases the transmission rate by 20% and thus leads to around a 50,000 increase of total cases and 3,000 increase in total deaths.\nFurthermore, a similar result was presented in a cross-sectional study. Meneghesso et al. mentioned that a strict lockdown with a widespread molecular COVID-19 test (40-50 test/million) in Veneto, Italy was effective in accelerating the pandemic peak and preventing the collapse of the healthcare system.\nLimitations of study\nThere are six preprint studies included in this review, rated as moderate evidence. Therefore, there might still be some future changes which could affect the results of this review. However, these evidences are the best ones to date. Given the urgent need of guidance, we only include papers written in English to eliminate the time needed for formal translation.\nThe outcomes of this study focused on incidence, transmission, mortality, and resource use of mass testing, lockdown, and a combination of both, as selected by WHO expert panel for the decision making. Psychological impact, economic disruption, and other health adverse effects are several important factors that need to be considered in the decision making of public health intervention policy but was not addressed in this article.\nConclusions\nImplications for practice\nLockdown was pretty consistently proven to be effective in mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic by substantially reducing the incidence, onward transmission, and mortality. Despite the limited evidence on mass testing to control COVID-19, random weekly mass testing was effective in reducing the total infected people compared to no mass testing. Based on limited evidence, a combination of both lockdown and mass screening resulted in a greater reduction of incidence and mortality rate compared to lockdown only, but resulted in a similar mortality rate compared to mass testing only.\nImplications for research\nStudies on the clinical effectiveness of mass testing are still urgently needed. There should also be more studies on the clinical and cost effectiveness of different mass testing and lockdown methods. Moreover, modelling studies on lockdown and mass testing should incorporate more factors (e.g. the heterogeneity of infectiousness, incubation period, and recovery time, immunity of recovered patients, deceased patients, various social interactions, age structure) to give a better understanding of the actual implementation.\nReferences\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) situation report - 46\nPathogenicity and transmissibility of 2019-nCoV:a quick overview and 2 comparison with other emerging viruses\nThe effectiveness of quarantine of Wuhan City against the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): a well-mixed SEIR model analysis\nThe effectiveness of quarantine and isolation determine the trend of the COVID-19 epidemics in the final phase of the current outbreak in China\nInterrupting transmission of COVID-19: lessons from containment efforts in Singapore\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): situation report, 37\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): situation report, 57\nPreferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses: the PRISMA statement\nGlobal surveillance for COVID-19 caused by human infection with COVID-19\nRationale and Goals for Community Containment\nThe basic reproduction number as a predictor for epidemic outbreaks in temporal networks\nPrice of delay in Covid-19 lockdowns: Delays spike total cases, natural experiments reveal\nQuality assessment tool for quantitative studies\nHeterogeneous social interactions and the COVID-19 lockdown outcome in a multi-group SEIR model\nEarly detection of superspreaders by mass group pool testing can mitigate COVID-19 pandemic\nLockdown exit strategies and risk of a second epidemic peak: a stochastic agentbased model of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in France\nLockdown contained the spread of 2019 novel coronavirus disease in Huangshi city, China: Early epidemiological findings\nThe positive impact of lockdown in Wuhan on containing the COVID-19 outbreak in China\nApplication of SEIR Model in COVID-19 and the effect of lockdown on reducing the number of active cases\nContinued and serious lockdown could minimize many newly transmitted cases of COVID-19 in the U.S.: Wavelets, deterministic models, and data.

set standards in the reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses.\n\n Our aim was to evaluate the impact of PRISMA endorsement on the quality of reporting and methodological quality of systematic reviews and meta-analyses, published in journals in the field of gastroenterology and hepatology (GH).\n\n\nMethods\nQuality of reporting and methodological quality were evaluated by assessing the adherence of papers to PRISMA checklist and AMSTAR quality scale.\n\n After identifying the GH journals which endorsed PRISMA in instructions for authors (IA), we appraised: 15 papers published in 2012 explicitly mentioning PRISMA in the full text (Group A); 15 papers from the same journals published in 2012 not explicitly mentioning PRISMA in the full text (Group B); 30 papers published the year preceding PRISMA endorsement from the same journals as above (Group C); 30 papers published in 2012 on the 10 highest impact factor journals in GH which not endorsed PRISMA (Group D).\n\n\nResults\nPRISMA statement was referred in the IA in 9 out of 70 GH journals (12.9%).\n\n We found significant increase in overall adherence to PRISMA checklist (Group A, 90.1%; Group C,

and meta-analyses published in nursing journals: a cross-sectional study","abstract":"Objective\nSystematic reviews (SRs) often poorly report key information, thereby diminishing their usefulness.\n\n Previous studies evaluated published SRs and determined that they failed to meet explicit criteria or characteristics.\n\n The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement was recommended as a reporting guideline for SR and meta-analysis (MA), but previous studies showed that adherence to the statement was not high for SRs published in different medical fields.\n\n Thus, the aims of this study are twofold: (1) to investigate the number of nursing journals that have required or recommended the use of the PRISMA statement for reporting SR, and (2) to examine the adherence of SRs and/or meta-analyses to the PRISMA statement published in nursing journals.\n\n\nDesign\nA cross-sectional study.\n\n\nMethods\nNursing journals listed in the ISI journal citation report were divided into 2 groups based on the recommendation of PRISMA statement in their ‘Instruction for Authors’.\n\n SRs and meta-analyses published in 2014 were searched in 3 databases.\n\n 37 SRs and meta-analyses were randomly selected in each group.\n\n The adherence of each item to the PRISMA was examined and summarised using descriptive statistics.\n\n The quality of the SRs was assessed by Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews.\n\n The differences between the 2 groups were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test.\n\n\nResults\nOut of 107 nursing journals, 30 (28.0%) recommended or required authors to follow the PRISMA statement when they submit SRs or meta-analyses.\n\n The median rates of adherence to the PRISMA statement for reviews published in journals with and without PRISMA endorsement were 64.9% (IQR: 17.6–92.3%) and 73.0% (IQR: 59.5–94.6%), respectively.\n\n No significant difference was observed in any of the items between the 2 groups.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe median adherence of SRs and meta-analyses in nursing journals to PRISMA is low at 64.9% and 73.0%, respectively.\n\n Nonetheless, the adherence level of nursing journals to the PRISMA statement does not significantly vary whether they endorse or recommend such a guideline.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5306529","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BMJ Publishing

QUOROM to PRISMA: A Survey of High-Impact Medical Journals' Instructions to Authors and a Review of Systematic Reviews in Anesthesia Literature","abstract":"Background\nThe PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) Statement was published to help authors improve how they report systematic reviews.\n\n It is unknown how many journals mention PRISMA in their instructions to authors, or whether stronger journal language regarding use of PRISMA improves author compliance.\n\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nAn Internet-based investigation examined the extent to which 146 leading medical journals have incorporated the PRISMA Statement into their instructions to authors.\n\n Results were analyzed using descriptive statistics.\n\n Also, systematic reviews published in the leading anesthesiology journals and the QUOROM (QUality Of Reporting Of Meta-analyses) Statement were used to explore the hypothesis that indicating compliance with the QUOROM Statement in the manuscript is associated with improved compliance with the reporting guideline.\n\n In a sample of 146 journals publishing systematic reviews, the PRISMA Statement was referred to in the instructions to authors for 27% (40/146) of journals; more often in general and internal medicine journals (7/14; 50%) than in specialty medicine journals (33/132; 25%).\n\n In the second part of the study, 13 systematic reviews published in the leading anesthesiology journals in 2008 were included for appraisal.\n\n Mention of the QUOROM Statement in the manuscript was associated with higher compliance with the QUOROM checklist (P?=?0.022).\n\n\nConclusions/Significance\nMost of the leading medical journals used ambiguous language regarding what was expected of authors.\n\n Further improvement on quality of reporting of systematic reviews may entail journals clearly informing authors of their requirements.\n\n Stronger directions, such as requiring an indication of adherence to a research quality of reporting statement in the manuscript, may improve reporting and utility of systematic reviews.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3217994","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public

time intervals, meaning that periods of high activity are followed by long periods of inactivity.\n To investigate the impact of these heterogeneities in the spread of infection from a theoretical perspective, we propose a stochastic model to generate temporal networks where vertices make instantaneous contacts following heterogeneous inter-event intervals, and may leave and enter the system.\n We study how these properties affect the prevalence of an infection and estimate , the number of secondary infections of an infectious individual in a completely susceptible population, by modeling simulated infections (SI and SIR) that co-evolve with the network structure.\n We find that heterogeneous contact patterns cause earlier and larger epidemics in the SIR model in comparison to homogeneous scenarios for a vast range of parameter values, while smaller epidemics may happen in some combinations of parameters.\n In the case of SI and heterogeneous patterns, the epidemics develop faster in the earlier stages followed by a slowdown in the asymptotic limit.\n For increasing vertex turnover rates, heterogeneous patterns generally cause higher prevalence in comparison to homogeneous scenarios with the same average inter-event interval.\n We find thatis generally higher for heterogeneous patterns, except for sufficiently large infection duration and transmission

represent one of the important routes of transmission of hospital-acquired infections (HAI).\n\n A detailed description and quantification of contacts in hospitals provides key information for HAIs epidemiology and for the design and validation of control measures.\n\n\nMethods and Findings\nWe used wearable sensors to detect close-range interactions (“contacts”) between individuals in the geriatric unit of a university hospital.\n\n Contact events were measured with a spatial resolution of about 1.5 meters and a temporal resolution of 20 seconds.\n\n The study included 46 HCWs and 29 patients and lasted for 4 days and 4 nights.\n\n 14,037 contacts were recorded overall, 94.1% of which during daytime.\n\n The number and duration of contacts varied between mornings, afternoons and nights, and contact matrices describing the mixing patterns between HCW and patients were built for each time period.\n\n Contact patterns were qualitatively similar from one day to the next.\n\n 38% of the contacts occurred between pairs of HCWs and 6 HCWs accounted for 42% of all the contacts including at least one patient, suggesting a population of individuals who could potentially act as

spaces of the two canonical models of infectious disease epidemiology—the Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible (SIS) and Susceptible-Infectious-Removed (SIR) models.\n The results from these simulations are compared to reference data where we eliminate structures in the interevent intervals, the time to the first contact in the data, or the time from the last contact to the end of the sampling.\n The picture we find is that the birth and death of links, and the total number of contacts over a link, are essential to predict outbreaks.\n On the other hand, the exact times of contacts between the beginning and end, or the interevent interval distribution, do not matter much.\n In other words, a simplified picture of these empirical data sets that suffices for epidemiological purposes is that links are born, is active with some intensity, and die.\n","id":"PMC4031628","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing

hinder the discrimination of inactive ties from large interevent times in active ones.\n We develop a principled method to detect tie de-activation and apply it to a large longitudinal, cross-sectional communication dataset (?19 months, ?20 million people).\n Contrary to the perception of ever-growing connectivity, we observe that individuals exhibit a finite communication capacity, which limits the number of ties they can maintain active in time.\n On average men display higher capacity than women, and this capacity decreases for both genders over their lifespan.\n Separating communication capacity from activity reveals a diverse range of tie activation strategies, from stable to exploratory.\n This allows us to draw novel relationships between individual strategies for human interaction and the evolution of social networks at global scale.\n","id":"PMC3674429","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Nature Publishing

Optimal Static Networks from Temporal Network Data","abstract":"One of network epidemiology's central assumptions is that the contact structure over which infectious diseases propagate can be represented as a static network.\n However, contacts are highly dynamic, changing at many time scales.\n In this paper, we investigate conceptually simple methods to construct static graphs for network epidemiology from temporal contact data.\n We evaluate these methods on empirical and synthetic model data.\n For almost all our cases, the network representation that captures most relevant information is a so-called exponential-threshold network.\n In these, each contact contributes with a weight decreasing exponentially with time, and there is an edge between a pair of vertices if the weight between them exceeds a threshold.\n Networks of aggregated contacts over an optimally chosen time window perform almost as good as the exponential-threshold networks.\n On the other hand, networks of accumulated contacts over the entire sampling time, and networks of concurrent partnerships, perform worse.\n We discuss these observations in the context of the temporal and topological

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family

individuals.\n\n Knowledge of these patterns is thus essential to inform models and computational efforts.\n\n However, there are few empirical studies available that provide estimates of the number and duration of contacts between social groups.\n\n Moreover, their space and time resolutions are limited, so that data are not explicit at the person-to-person level, and the dynamic nature of the contacts is disregarded.\n\n In this study, we aimed to assess the role of data-driven dynamic contact patterns between individuals, and in particular of their temporal aspects, in shaping the spread of a simulated epidemic in the population.\n\n\nMethods\nWe considered high-resolution data about face-to-face interactions between the attendees at a conference, obtained from the deployment of an infrastructure based on radiofrequency identification (RFID) devices that assessed mutual face-to-face proximity.\n\n The spread of epidemics along these interactions was simulated using an SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered) model, using both the dynamic network of contacts defined by the collected data, and two aggregated versions of such networks, to assess the role of the data temporal aspects.\n\n\nResults\nWe show that, on the timescales considered, an aggregated network taking into account the daily duration of contacts is a good approximation to the full resolution network, whereas a homogeneous representation that retains only the topology of the contact network fails to reproduce the size of the epidemic.\n\n\nConclusions\nThese results have important

Pooling to Conserve SARS CoV-2 Testing Resources","abstract":"Objectives\nTo establish the optimal parameters for group testing of pooled specimens for the detection of SARS-CoV-2.\nMethods\nThe most efficient pool size was determined to be five specimens using a web-based application.\n\n From this analysis, 25 experimental pools were created using 50 µL from one SARS-CoV-2 positive nasopharyngeal specimen mixed with 4 negative patient specimens (50 µL each) for a total volume of 250 µL.\n\n Viral RNA was subsequently extracted from each pool and tested using the CDC SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay.\n\n Positive pools were consequently split into individual specimens and tested by extraction and PCR.\n\n This method was also tested on an unselected group of 60 nasopharyngeal specimens grouped into 12 pools.\n\n\nResults\nAll 25 pools were positive with cycle threshold (Ct) values within 0 and 5.03 Ct of the original individual specimens.\n\n The analysis of 60 specimens determined that 2 pools were positive followed by identification of 2 individual specimens among the 60 tested.\n\n This testing was accomplished while using 22 extractions/PCR tests, a savings of 38 reactions.\n\n\nConclusions\nWhen the incidence rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection is 10% or less, group testing will result in the saving of reagents and personnel time with an overall increase in testing capability of at least 69%.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7188150","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Oxford University

Scarce resources allocation in the COVID-19 outbreak","abstract":"After initially emerging in China, the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak has advanced rapidly.\n The World Health Organization (WHO) has recently declared it a pandemic, with Europe becoming its new epicentre.\n Italy has so far been the most severely hit European country and demand for critical care in the northern region currently exceeds its supply.\n This raises significant ethical concerns, among which is the allocation of scarce resources.\n Professionals are considering the prioritisation of patients most likely to survive over those with remote chances, and this news has triggered an intense debate about the right of every individual to access healthcare.\n The proposed analysis suggests that the national emergency framework in which prioritisation criteria are currently enforced should not lead us to perceive scarce resources allocation as something new.\n From an ethical perspective, the novelty of the current emergency is not grounded in the devastating effects of scarce resources allocation, which is rife in recent and present clinical practice.\n Rather, it has to do with the extraordinarily high number of people who find themselves personally affected by the implications of scarce resources allocation and who suddenly realise that the principle of ‘equals should be treated equally’ may no longer be applicable.\n Along with the need to allocate appropriate additional financial resources to support the healthcare system, and thus to mitigate the scarcity of resources, the analysis insists on the relevance of a medical ethics perspective that does not place the burden of care and choice solely on physicians.\n","id":"PMC7242866","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BMJ Publishing Group","authors":[{"firstname":"Chiara","surname":"Mannelli","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMp2005689","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The toughest triage:allocating ventilators in a pandemic","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1001/jama.2020.5046","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A framework for rationing ventilators and critical care beds during the COVID-19 pandemic","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1136/medethics-2020-106332","date":"2020-04-20","title":"Who gets the ventilator?

health conditions of the residents and the movement of health care personnel among facilities in a region.\n\n\nMethods\nAfter identification on February 28, 2020, of a confirmed case of Covid-19 in a skilled nursing facility in King County, Washington, Public Health–Seattle and King County, aided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, launched a case investigation, contact tracing, quarantine of exposed persons, isolation of confirmed and suspected cases, and on-site enhancement of infection prevention and control.\n\n\nResults\nAs of March 18, a total of 167 confirmed cases of Covid-19 affecting 101 residents, 50 health care personnel, and 16 visitors were found to be epidemiologically linked to the facility.\n\n Most cases among residents included respiratory illness consistent with Covid-19; however, in 7 residents no symptoms were documented.\n\n Hospitalization rates for facility residents, visitors, and staff were 54.5%, 50.0%, and 6.0%, respectively.\n\n The case fatality rate for residents was 33.7% (34 of 101).\n\n As of March 18, a total of 30 long-term care facilities with at least one confirmed case of Covid-19 had been identified in King County.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn the context of rapidly escalating Covid-19 outbreaks, proactive steps by long-term care facilities to identify and exclude potentially infected staff and visitors, actively monitor for potentially infected patients, and implement appropriate infection prevention and control measures are needed to prevent the introduction of Covid-19.\n","id":"PMC7121761","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical Society","authors":[{"firstname":"Temet

result, diagnostic services are stretched to their limit, and there is a clear need for the provision of additional diagnostic capacity.\n Academic laboratories, many of which are closed due to governmental lockdowns, may be in a position to support local screening capacity by adapting their current laboratory practices.\n Here, we describe the process of developing a SARS-Cov2 diagnostic workflow in a conventional academic Containment Level 2 laboratory.\n Our outline includes simple SARS-Cov2 deactivation upon contact, the method for a quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR detecting SARS-Cov2, a description of process establishment and validation, and some considerations for establishing a similar workflow elsewhere.\n This was achieved under challenging circumstances through the collaborative efforts of scientists, clinical staff, and diagnostic staff to mitigate to the ongoing crisis.\n Within 14 days, we created a validated COVID-19 diagnostics service for healthcare workers in our local hospital.\n The described methods are not exhaustive, but we hope may offer support to other academic groups aiming to set up something comparable in a short time frame.\n","id":"PMC7590889","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"F1000 Research

inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study","abstract":"Background\nSince December, 2019, Wuhan, China, has experienced an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).\n\n Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (?18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.\n\n\nFindings\n191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital.\n\n 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients).\n\n Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·03–1·17, per year increase; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·61–12·23; p&lt;0·0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL (18·42, 2·64–128·55; p=0·0033) on admission.\n\n Median duration of viral shedding was 20·0 days (IQR 17·0–24·0) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors.\n\n The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage.\n\n Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.\n\n\nFunding\nChinese Academy of Medical Sciences Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences; National Science Grant for Distinguished Young Scholars; National Key Research and Development Program of China; The Beijing Science and Technology Project; and Major Projects of National Science and Technology on New Drug Creation and Development.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7270627","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"Fei","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ronghui","surname":"Du","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Guohui","surname":"Fan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhibo","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jie","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yeming","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiaoying","surname":"Gu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lulu","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xudong","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jiuyang","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shengjin","surname":"Tu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hua","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Cao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"An epidemic model SIPHERD and its application for prediction of the spread of COVID-19 infection for India and USA.
