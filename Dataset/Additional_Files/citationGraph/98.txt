Using ICE detainee population data obtained from the ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) website as of March 2, 2020, we implemented a simple stochastic susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered model to estimate the rate of COVID-19 transmission within 111 ICE detention facilities and then examined impacts on regional hospital intensive care unit (ICU) capacity. Models considered three scenarios of transmission (optimistic, moderate, pessimistic) over 30-, 60-, and 90-day time horizons across a range of facility sizes. We found that 72% of individuals are expected to be infected by day 90 under the optimistic scenario (R0 = 2.5), while nearly 100% of individuals are expected to be infected by day 90 under a more pessimistic (R0 = 7) scenario. Although asynchronous outbreaks are more likely, day 90 estimates provide an approximation of total positive cases after all ICE facility outbreaks. We determined that, in the most optimistic scenario, coronavirus outbreaks among a minimum of 65 ICE facilities (59%) would overwhelm ICU beds within a 10-mile radius and outbreaks among a minimum of 8 ICE facilities (7%) would overwhelm local ICU beds within a 50-mile radius over a 90-day period, provided every ICU bed was made available for sick detainees. As policymakers seek to rapidly implement interventions that ensure the continued availability of life-saving medical resources across the USA, they may be overlooking the pressing need to slow the spread of COVID-19 infection in ICE's detention facilities. Preventing the rapid spread necessitates intervention measures such as granting ICE detainees widespread release from an unsafe environment by returning them to the community.\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (10.1007/s11524-020-00441-x) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\nBackground\nThe USA operates the largest immigrant detention system in the world, with over 140,000 immigrants arrested in 2019 or nearly 383 people a day. The conditions of confinement at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities are designed to control and closely surveil the population. This setting is discordant with public health guidance aiming to reduce the transmission of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), especially including advice around physical distancing and frequent hand washing. Furthermore, because detained immigrants are not housed individually or in cells as is true in many prison settings, detainees have more contacts with one another and with staff, thereby contributing to faster spread of infection than in correctional facilities. On March 24, 2020, ICE recorded its first documented COVID-19 case: a 31-year-old immigrant at Bergen County Jail in New Jersey. This case, documented less than a week after a correctional staff member at the facility also tested positive, underscores the potential of this virus to rapidly spread in enclosed environments and the potential for COVID-19 outbreaks in other detention facilities. As of April 16, 2020, ICE reported that 100 detainees had tested positive for COVID-19, across 13 states.\nCOVID-19 is a respiratory illness that most severely affects individuals over the age of 65 and individuals with underlying health conditions, such as those who are immunocompromised, have asthma, or suffer from diabetes. COVID-19 can lead to severe conditions, including breathing difficulties and lung damage, hospitalization, admission to a hospital intensive care unit (ICU), and death. Although public data on the health status and underlying health conditions of individuals detained in ICE detention facilities are limited, numerous reports document insufficient medical care as detailed in the lay press, whistleblower complaints, and a Department of Homeland Security report. The poor medical care of detainees includes missed diagnoses and incorrect vaccine doses. Additionally, the literature documenting the health of undocumented individuals indicates they are more likely than the general population to be uninsured, have had poor prenatal care, and face stressors such as stigma, discrimination, and fear of deportation:all factors that negatively impact physical and mental health.\nIn response to mounting concern about the potential for a COVID-19 outbreak among this highly vulnerable population of individuals held in detention facilities, ICE has reportedly implemented several measures aimed at reducing the risk of virus transmission. Such measures are said to include suspending social visitation and releasing a small subset of individuals who are determined to be a low &quot;threat to public safety, flight risk, and national security&quot; and have underlying health conditions that may cause acute complications upon infection. However, outbreaks at correctional facilities across the country suggest that these measures are insufficient to prevent COVID-19 infections within enclosed environments. Cook County Jail, for example, was the largest single-site source of COVID-19 cases in the nation. From March 22 to April 12, 2020, the number of cases at the jail grew from one incarcerated individual to over 300 known cases among prisoners and over 180 among correctional staff. On April 20, 2020, the Marion Correctional Institution, an Ohio prison, reported a 78% COVID-19 infection rate: 1950 inmates and 154 staff had been diagnosed with the virus there. The prison reported its first case just three weeks prior on March 29th, underscoring the fast pace of transmission in such environments.\nAs COVID-19 continues to spread in communities, and inevitably into the nation's detention centers, it is critical that we understand the US healthcare system's capacity to care for a large influx of patients who require critical care. In the present study, we estimate the number of COVID-19 cases likely to occur within ICE detention facilities, using varying levels of virus transmissibility, and examine the capacity of local hospitals to care for additional patient ICE detainees over 30-, 60-, and 90-day time horizons.\nMethods\nModel\nWe implemented a simple stochastic susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) model. In this model, individuals are initially susceptible (S) to COVID-19 infection and become infected and transition to an exposed class (E) at a rate dependent on the reproductive number, known as the R0, and the proportion of individuals who are currently infectious (I). Individuals in the exposed class then transition to an infectious state (I) after a latent period and, finally, to a recovered state (R) at a constant recovery rate. The SEIR model and related variants support the vast majority of COVID-19 modeling studies around the world at present.\nThe transition states of the model are as follows:where N is the fixed population size, beta is the transmissibility, 1/sigma is the incubation period, and 1/gamma is the recovery period. All events are assumed to be Poisson-distributed, and a Tau-leaping method was implemented to draw realizations of the epidemic process. For each scenario, 1000 replicates were drawn. To prevent stochastic burnout, we performed simulations using an initial condition of five infectious detainees. Numbers of cases are reported as medians with confidence intervals arising directly from multiple realizations of the stochastic model. In addition to estimating the number of infected individuals, our simulations also show the timing and size of the peak of the epidemic (see Supplementary Information).\nThe estimated proportion of infected people requiring hospitalization and/or ICU admissions during our simulated epidemics is calculated from the cumulative number of infectious individuals over 30-, 60-, and 90-day time horizons. The numbers of individuals requiring hospitalization or ICU admission were estimated based on the age distribution of people within the facility (see below), multiplied by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates of the fraction of infected people within defined age classes requiring treatment. We used the minimum rate for each age group in our calculations.\nInitial Conditions\nOn day 0 of the epidemic, five individuals are assumed to be infected (in state I), with the rest being susceptible for a range of fixed population sizes chosen to be reflective of facility sizes: 50, 100, 500, and 1000.\nParameterization\nGiven the current unknowns in the rate of spread of COVID-19 in detention centers, epidemiological parameters were based on estimates of an outbreak on cruise ships, representing a controlled environment with a high rate of contact between individuals. R0 is the expected number of cases directly generated by one case in a population where all individuals are susceptible to infection and is a product of the rate of contact between individuals, the probability of infection per contact, and the average time an individual is infectious. Estimates for the R0 based on the Diamond Princess cruise ship outbreak range from 2.28 (95% CI 2.06-2.52) to as high as 14.8. Outbreaks have also been documented onboard several other cruise ships and navy ships, including the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt, where nine crew members are currently hospitalized and one has died. Studies based on these confined settings for viral spread will provide additional information for future studies. Drawing from the published estimates, we studied three scenarios ranging from a most optimistic to most pessimistic estimate of the R0 as 2.5, 3.5, and 7 for low, medium, and high R0 scenarios, respectively. The incubation and infectious periods were estimated to be 6.4 days and 7 days, respectively.\nPopulation Data\nICE detainee population data were downloaded directly from the Department of Homeland Security Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) website. The average number of detainees between October 1, 2019 and March 2, 2020 was used to approximate the current number of people detained at each detention facility and summed to approximate the total number of people currently detained by ICE. To our knowledge, these are the most up-to-date estimates of detainees per facility. We excluded facilities with less than 25 people to meet the minimum population requirement for stability of estimates in the COVID-19 model. ICE currently withholds the age of arrest for detainees; thus, we used the age distribution provided by the Freedom for Immigrants, an advocacy organization that has interviewed thousands of people in immigration detention and reported age demographics in April 2019.\nWe determined ICU capacity using the Definitive Healthcare USA Hospital Bed data. Definitive Healthcare is a leading provider of data on healthcare organizations throughout the USA and has made these data freely available during the COVID-19 crisis. We used the version of this data updated on April 3, 2020. The Definitive Healthcare USA group also created an ICU capacity predictor tool. This tool combines ICU hospital bed and ventilator availability/utilization data, Census Bureau population density, demographic information, and New York Times COVID-19 case data to determine the ICU capacity per county. We pulled this information for each county with an ICE facility. We then determined the ICU capacity for each ICE facility in a geospatial analysis program (ArcGIS; ESRI, Redlands, CA). We geocoded the ICE facilities and incorporated the Definitive Healthcare USA hospital bed data for analysis. We used the geospatial Buffer tool to create a 10-mile and 50-mile buffer around each ICE facility (Buffer, ArcGIS). Radii of 10 and 50 miles were selected as healthcare service catchment areas within which detention facilities may reasonably be expected to transport for patient care. We used the Spatial Join tool from the spatial analysis toolbar to pull ICU bed information from the hospitals that were located in the 10-mile and 50-mile ICE facility buffers (Spatial Join, ArcGIS). We summed the ICU bed total per ICE facility (R, version 3.3) and applied the Definitive Healthcare USA ICU capacity predictor to determine the final number of ICU beds available to each ICE facility.\nResults\nData for the models of COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations, and ICU admissions considered the average detention population from October 1, 2019 to March 2, 2020 in 111 facilities across 32 states. The number of detainees in each facility during this period ranged from 25 to 1600 (average 381, median 234 detainees), with a total of 42,435 individuals detained. Thirty-two percent (n = 35) of the included facilities hold only ICE detainees, and 68% (n = 76) are city or county correctional facilities that hold ICE detainees and other individuals who are incarcerated. Although sex data were not available at the individual level, we obtained facility-level sex data. There were 577 women held in two female-only facilities; 15,560 individuals were held in 43 male-only facilities; and 26,208 detainees were in facilities that held both females and males.\nBased on 2019 data provided by Freedom for Immigrants, the majority of immigrants detained by ICE are between 26 and 35 years old, where the median age is 30. Country of origin for detainees included in this analysis was not available; however, a 2019 report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office found that the majority of detentions from 2015 to 2018 were males from Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras, without a previous arrest or conviction record.\nNumber of Infections over Time in Single-Facility Outbreaks\nFor different sized facilities and estimates of the basic reproduction number R0, estimated median (and 95% confidence intervals) aggregate number of infected detainees, to 30, 60, and 90 days after the outbreak began. Median hospitalization and ICU admission numbers (to day 90) are also shown\nFacility size	Median number (95% CI) COVID-19 positive	Median number (95% CI), 90 days	 	30 days	60 days	90 days	Hospitalizations	ICU admissions	 	R0 = 2.5	 	  50	25 (7, 36)	36 (11, 43)	38 (11, 44)	6	1	 	  100	36 (7, 62)	71 (15, 87)	80 (19, 90)	13	2	 	  500	60 (12, 128)	258 (46, 366)	386 (181, 437)	58	9	 	  1000	494 (491, 495)	363 (35, 605)	722 (203, 834)	114	17	 	R0 = 3.5	 	  50	33 (16, 42)	42 (32, 45)	43 (35, 45)	7	1	 	  100	59 (24, 80)	88 (69, 94)	90 (79, 94)	15	2	 	  500	136 (36, 232)	422 (277, 460)	466 (441, 480)	70	11	 	  1000	163 (40, 309)	792 (491, 884)	933 (891, 956)	148	22	 	R0 = 7	 	  50	43 (38, 45)	45 (44, 45)	45 (44, 45)	7	1	 	  100	89 (77, 93)	95 (93, 95)	95 (93, 95)	16	2	 	  500	407 (310, 444)	493 (489, 495)	494 (491, 495)	75	11	 	  1000	732 (519, 823)	989 (982, 994)	993 (989, 995)	157	24	 	\nCI confidence interval\nProportion of population infected with COVID-19 over time by R0 value and facility size\nTable 1 shows the estimated number of COVID-19 cases across the three R0 scenarios over 30-, 60-, and 90-day time horizons, for ICE facilities holding 50, 100, 500, and 1000 detainees. In a facility holding 1000 people, under the most optimistic scenario (R0 = 2.5), a median of 62 individuals are expected to have been infected by day 30, 363 by day 60, and 722 by day 90. Under the least optimistic scenario of R0 = 7, the number of cumulative COVID-19 cases is modeled to increase from 732 by day 30, to 989 by day 60, to 993 by day 90. The day 90 estimates, corresponding to 76%, 80%, 77%, and 72% of all detainees in facilities of size 50, 100, 500, and 1000 detainees, give a sense of the total population of ICE detainees who are likely to be infected by the end of an ICE facility outbreak under the most optimistic scenario of R0 = 2.5 (Fig. 1). Regarding the timing and size of the peak of the epidemic, as one would predict, simulated epidemics within small facilities reach their peak earlier than those within large facilities (for example, on day 19 for facilities of 50 detainees vs day 69 for facilities of 1000 detainees with R0 = 3.5; see Supplemental Materials).\nHealthcare Service Utilization during Facility Outbreaks\nUnder the most optimistic scenario (R0 = 2.5), and imagining synchronized epidemics across all facilities, a median of 917 detainees system-wide will become infected and require hospitalization within the first 30 days, growing to an aggregate of 3129 patients by day 60 and 4909 by day 90. Averaging across the total ICE system, this represents 11.6% of all detainees. The high hospitalization rate is driven by sustained transmission leading to very high fractions of detainees becoming infected, in the absence of robust and sustained countermeasures. The corresponding numbers for ICE facilities of different sizes at day 90 are given in Table 1. Under the pessimistic scenario of R0 = 7, and imagining synchronized epidemics across all facilities, a median of 5145 detainees system-wide will become infected and require hospitalization within the first 30 days, growing to an aggregate of 6391 patients by day 60 and 6408 patients by day 90. Averaging across the total ICE system, this represents 15.1% of all detainees. Concretely, in a facility housing 1000 detainees, the estimated median number of people infected and requiring hospitalization by day 30 ranges from 10 (R0 = 2.5) to 26 (R0 = 3.5) and 116 (R0 = 7) and by day 90 ranges from 114 (R0 = 2.5) to 148 (R0 = 3.5) and 157 (R0 = 7).\nFocusing now on estimating ICU admissions, we estimate that with R0 = 2.5, and again imagining that all epidemics are synchronized, there will be a median of 139 detainees infected who will require ICU admission after 30 days, growing to an aggregate of 475 patients by day 60 and 745 patients by day 90 (approximately 1.8% of the total population). Under the pessimistic scenario of R0 = 7, the corresponding numbers of patients are 782, 971, and 973 on days 30, 60, and 90, respectively. This corresponds to approximately 2.3% of the total population.\nEstimating Hospital Utilization during an Unmitigated Epidemic\nNumber of ICE facilities with an overwhelmed hospital catchment and additional ICU beds needed to meet ICE demand, by R0 and size of facility. This information is presented for days 30, 60, and 90 after the start of an outbreak\nHospital catchment	30 days	60 days	90 days	 	ICE facilities where ICU bed demand exceeds capacity, R0 = 2.5	 	  10 miles	56	62	65	 	  50 miles	6	7	8	 	ICE facilities where ICU bed demand exceeds capacity, R0 = 3.5	 	  10 miles	58	66	66	 	  50 miles	6	8	10	 	ICE facilities where ICU bed demand exceeds capacity, R0 = 7.0	 	  10 miles	66	66	66	 	  50 miles	8	10	10	 	\nThere are 33 facilities without hospitals within 10 miles of the ICE facility while all facilities have a hospital within 50 miles. A COVID-19 outbreak at a number of detention facilities would potentially overwhelm local ICU capacity within a 10- and 50-mile radius of each facility (Table 2). Under the most optimistic scenario (R0 = 2.5), and imagining synchronized epidemics across all facilities, estimated median aggregate ICU admissions from 56 facilities by day 30, 62 facilities by day 60, and 65 facilities by day 90 would exceed ICU capacity within 10 miles of the facility. These numbers include those facilities with no ICU capacity within 10 miles. Under the least optimistic scenario (R0 = 7), the numbers of facilities where ICU beds within 10 miles would not be adequate increases to 66 facilities within 30 days of onset and this persists through 60 and 90 days. A small number of facilities are also estimated to generate more ICU needs than ICU beds within 50 miles during the first 30 days of onset (six such facilities for R0 = 2.5 or 3.5 and eight such facilities for R0 = 7). For R0 = 2.5 and R0 = 7, the aggregate number of patients requiring ICU admission exceeds available beds within 50 miles for 8 and 10 facilities at 90 days, respectively.\nDiscussion\nTo our knowledge, this is the first analysis assessing the impact of COVID-19 on ICE detainees and the wider communities likely to care for detainees. Across the 111 ICE facilities we examined, and considering all three scenarios, the cumulative number of ICU admissions by day 90 for over half of facilities would exceed hospital capacity within a 10-mile radius. The impact on hospital capacity is lower if the radius was expanded to 50 miles, hovering around 8% of facilities exceeding ICU demand. These models do not take into account other concerns that would strain ICE's operational capacity at a time when staffing is likely to be a concern, such as the difficulty and risk to staff of repeatedly transporting and guarding detainees up to 50 miles distant from their facilities of origin. The timing and peak number of cases are driven by facility size, which also are important when considering preventive interventions.\nOur findings suggest several possible interventions. Short of vaccination or a breakthrough treatment, effective interventions pertain to strategies to diffuse density. Lowering a facility's population density can slow the spread by lowering its R0. Figure S1 in the Supplementary Materials demonstrates the impact of doing so: the total number of infections drop, the time to peak infection shifts, and the proportion of the population infected is lower. This suggests two strategies for selective release: (1) release of detainees with chronic health conditions who are older in age and could be better cared for in a community setting or (2) release of detainees that are younger in age (under 35 years old) plus those with chronic health conditions regardless of age. The former would be a more limited release, while the latter would considerably enlarge the number of individuals released. Deportation through formal court processes:rather than release:may be a pathway to reducing the susceptible population in the USA. Given the current and growing regime of border closures, as well as the time, process, and number of contacts and transports necessary to deport rather than liberate a detainee at this time, such a strategy would not be without serious complications and risks to ICE personnel, US border patrol, the courts, and the detainees themselves. This is compounded by both human rights concerns about returning detainees to countries of origin that are dangerous or oppressive. Such complications to a strategy of mass deportation may render this approach less viable than release into the general domestic community. While liberating most or all of the individuals currently being held would add individuals susceptible to complications to the broader population, it is a less infectious environment than a detention facility. In addition, ICE could reaffirm its March 18, 2020 commitment to stop apprehending all but the most dangerous people it targets for immigration enforcement, thereby reducing the number of new lodgings introduced to their facilities.\nInterventions within ICE facilities pose significant challenges, and reducing their R0 while maintaining detainee populations would require changes to a facility's physical space that may not be possible. The CDC and the Federal Bureau of Prisons outline best practices for reducing the spread of infectious diseases in correctional settings, such as careful attention to hygiene and disinfecting surfaces, prompt quarantine, isolation and treatment measures, awareness and mitigation of the risks of physical contact between persons, and designing daily routines and systems that minimize interpersonal interaction in the event of outbreaks. It is unknown if distribution of PPE and strict hand washing protocols, for example, could help slow transmission (i.e., lower the R0) nor how quickly this could improve matters. Even when aligned with published standards, detention facilities are typically overcrowded, house multiple individuals in bunk bed settings, and offer limited potential for social distancing, reducing the effectiveness of these measures even when they are carefully followed. The recommended six feet of separation for social distancing necessitates an approximate 28 sq. foot area for each detainee; however, this exceeds the minimum 25 sq. foot standard published by the American Correctional Association. Many ICE holding areas are not able to meet that standard, and some only afford detainees 3 sq. feet of space in holding areas. To at least some extent, this crowding is by design: the emphasis at these facilities is on behavior regulation techniques of control and surveillance made possible by a high population density and lower operating costs by minimizing the size of the facilities necessary to carry out this function. Regardless of what the actual R0 of COVID-19 in ICE detention facilities turns out to be, it is likely to be higher than returning the same population of individuals to the wider community.\nThis analysis has several important limitations. The data used to populate the models were the most complete and up to date that could be obtained at the time of analysis. A crucial limitation is our reliance upon estimates of the proportions of individuals requiring hospitalization and ICU access, across different ages, reported by a CDC report based on limited data: in time, these proportions may prove to be overestimates and the calculations we provide seen as overestimates. There are no known estimates of R0 for COVID-19 in a given prison or detention population, so we relied on an analogous population. To account for this imprecision, we modeled three plausible R0 estimates, elevating the likelihood that the system's actual R0 was modeled within this range. Our estimates of eventual prevalence for a confined population substantially exceed available data from cruise ship and navy ship outbreaks but are very much in line with recent reports from a prison setting. Full analysis of data from confined populations will be an excellent topic for full retrospective analysis. The treatment capacity of local hospitals was calculated using data made public the first week of April, but actual capacity over time will vary depending on the rate at which the virus spreads in the general population, and we may therefore have underestimated need. While data reporting the current number of ICE detainees may differ from those used in this analysis, they lack the facility-level specificity needed to calculate ICU bed demand. For example, news reports indicate that ICE bookings have decreased and summary deportations after attempting to enter the USA have reportedly increased as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. If these data were publicly available at the facility level, our results could be rendered more precise. A dearth of similar studies resulted in the need to approximate key values. The actual age distribution of ICE detainees at each facility is unknown, and we relied on aggregate estimates from 2019. We assumed a fixed contact rate over the course of the epidemic; a variable rate may be more appropriate, especially if ongoing studies derive a variable rate specific to the COVID-19 epidemic. Our model included counties in their entirety if any part of them fell within the specified radii of 10 and 50 miles, so it is likely that community health care capacities within these radii are overestimated. We note that our key assumption in determining how many ICE facilities would overwhelm hospital ICU capacity within a 10- and 50-mile radius was that all available ICU beds in these hospitals would be allocated to detainees in need of care. Overall, these assumptions suggest that our findings may have underestimated the number of infections and the number of facilities that will overwhelm the community ICU capacity.\nOur results assume a static population within ICE facilities. In reality, detainees enter and depart the facilities and are moved between them. Given high rates of infection, especially among economically disadvantaged populations, in the general population of the USA, it is unclear whether ingress/egress of detainees would typically represent a source or a sink of infection from ICE facilities. To study this in full would require extensive data from ICE, coupled to a model of community transmission across the country, and is beyond the scope of our current work.\nFinally, we presented the results here where all outbreaks were synchronized to start on the same day. There would likely be variation in the date of initial case within each facility, and subsequent peaks would potentially be distributed over a long time period. However, the analysis compared each facility's hospital needs with their corresponding community's ability to meet them using estimates that would not change based on such dates. Asynchronicity would principally mean that the model's results would not aggregate as demonstrated, but the individual facility-level analyses would still be illustrative of local challenges no matter how they were timed relative to those of other facilities.\nThe public health implications of this study are critical. They suggest that decisive action on the part of ICE will not only reduce morbidity and mortality outcomes in its population of detained immigrants but also minimize negative health outcomes in the communities that support ICE's detention facilities with health care resources. If hesitation prevails instead, and more limited measures on the part of ICE prove ineffective, then the successful social distancing strategies implemented in a community may be undone by the large number of detainee infectious disease cases that its hospitals must care for.\nThe study's other public health implications will endure beyond a pandemic which has brought the long-standing vulnerabilities of the nation's undocumented population into clearer relief. The COVID-19 pandemic highlights the need for further research into the health of the nation's undocumented immigrants and those detained by ICE. Beyond disaster planning, taking steps to improve the health and well-being of underserved populations is fundamental to public health.\nElectronic Supplementary Material\nDaniel Coombs and Michael Irvine are co-first authors.\nPublisher's Note\nSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.\nCompliance with Ethical Standards\nDisclaimer\nThe funding organizations had no role in the design and conduct of the study; in the collection, analysis, and interpretation of the data; and in the preparation, review, or approval of the manuscript.\nReferences\nKassie E.

Bangladesh has confirmed COVID-19 cases and hosts almost 1 million Rohingya refugees from Myanmar, with 600,000 concentrated in the Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site (mean age, 21 years; standard deviation [SD], 18 years; 52% female). Projections of the potential COVID-19 burden, epidemic speed, and healthcare needs in such settings are critical for preparedness planning.\nMethods and findings\nTo explore the potential impact of the introduction of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site, we used a stochastic Susceptible Exposed Infectious Recovered (SEIR) transmission model with parameters derived from emerging literature and age as the primary determinant of infection severity. We considered three scenarios with different assumptions about the transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2. From the simulated infections, we estimated hospitalizations, deaths, and healthcare needs expected, age-adjusted for the Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site age distribution. Our findings suggest that a large-scale outbreak is likely after a single introduction of the virus into the camp, with 61%-92% of simulations leading to at least 1,000 people infected across scenarios. On average, in the first 30 days of the outbreak, we expect 18 (95% prediction interval [PI], 2-65), 54 (95% PI, 3-223), and 370 (95% PI, 4-1,850) people infected in the low, moderate, and high transmission scenarios, respectively. These reach 421,500 (95% PI, 376,300-463,500), 546,800 (95% PI, 499,300-567,000), and 589,800 (95% PI, 578,800-595,600) people infected in 12 months, respectively. Hospitalization needs exceeded the existing hospitalization capacity of 340 beds after 55-136 days, between the low and high transmission scenarios. We estimate 2,040 (95% PI, 1,660-2,500), 2,650 (95% PI, 2,030-3,380), and 2,880 (95% PI, 2,090-3,830) deaths in the low, moderate, and high transmission scenarios, respectively. Due to limited data at the time of analyses, we assumed that age was the primary determinant of infection severity and hospitalization. We expect that comorbidities, limited hospitalization, and intensive care capacity may increase this risk; thus, we may be underestimating the potential burden.\nConclusions\nOur findings suggest that a COVID-19 epidemic in a refugee settlement may have profound consequences, requiring large increases in healthcare capacity and infrastructure that may exceed what is currently feasible in these settings. Detailed and realistic planning for the worst case in Kutupalong-Balukhali and all refugee camps worldwide must begin now. Plans should consider novel and radical strategies to reduce infectious contacts and fill health worker gaps while recognizing that refugees may not have access to national health systems.\nPaul Spiegel and colleagues estimate the potential consequences of COVID-19 outbreaks at refugee camps.\nAuthor summary\nWhy was this study done?\nForcibly displaced populations, especially those who reside in settlements with high density, poor access to water and sanitation, and limited health services, are especially vulnerable to COVID-19.\nBangladesh, which has confirmed COVID-19 cases, hosts almost 900,000 Rohingya refugees from Myanmar in the Cox's Bazar district, approximately 600,000 of whom are concentrated in the Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site.\nThe capacity to meet the existing health needs of this population is limited; an outbreak of COVID-19 within this population threatens to severely disrupt an already fragile situation.\nWe conducted this study to estimate the number of people infected, hospitalizations, and deaths that might occur in the Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site to inform ongoing preparedness and response activities by the Bangladesh government, the United Nations agencies, and other national and international actors.\nWhat did the researchers do and find?\nUsing a dynamic model of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission, we simulated how a COVID-19 outbreak could spread within the expansion site according to three possible transmission scenarios (high, moderate, and low).\nOur results suggest that a large-scale outbreak is very likely in this setting after a single infectious person enters the camp, with 0.5%-91% of the population expected to be infected within the first three months and over 70%-98% during the first year, depending on the transmission scenario, should no effective interventions be put into place.\nHospitalization needs may exceed the existing hospitalization capacity of 340 beds 55-136 days after introduction.\nWhat do these findings mean?\nA COVID-19 epidemic in a high-population density refugee settlement may have profound consequences, requiring increases in healthcare capacity and infrastructure that exceed what is feasible in this setting.\nAs many of the approaches used to prevent and respond to COVID-19 in the most affected areas so far will not be practical in humanitarian settings, novel and untested strategies to protect the most vulnerable population groups should be considered, as well as innovative solutions to fill health workforce gaps.\nIntroduction\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for hundreds of thousands of confirmed cases of COVID-19, globally, to date. With growing concern about the global inability to control its spread, rapid preparation and planning are critical, particularly where this virus may have the greatest impact. More than 7.2 million people live in refugee camps and settlements worldwide, where high population density, limited water and sanitation infrastructure, and limited healthcare resources can create ideal conditions for the spread of infectious diseases.\nOver 900,000 Rohingya refugees have sought refuge in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh; the majority arrived after 2017 fleeing ongoing violence in Myanmar (S1 Fig). Extending on flood-prone hilly terrain, the Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site has 23 congested settlements with nearly 600,000 persons. With over 46,000 persons per square kilometer, this site could qualify as one of the densest cities on earth. The majority of refugee families share their shelters, often composed of one single room. Half of the households have access to sufficient water to meet their needs; all water and hygiene facilities are public and overcrowded. The refugees are at high risk for epidemics given the high population density, poor health status, and limited health services. With confirmed COVID-19 cases in Bangladesh due to local transmission and ongoing transmission in neighboring countries, the introduction of the virus into the expansion site is likely.\nThe health status of refugees has improved since 2017 but remains fragile. The latest crude and child mortality rates are below emergency levels, while global acute malnutrition remains high. The site is served by five hospitals run by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and foreign governments, with a total of 340 hospital beds (5.7 beds per 10,000 population) and up to 630 hospital beds when needed (10.6 per 10,000 population). There are 24 primary healthcare centers (PHCs; 1 PHC/25,000 persons) with numerous health posts, although the total number of functioning PHCs varies. Outside of the refugee site, there are 910 beds available in Cox's Bazar district, including government, private, and NGO facilities for both the host community and refugees. The district hospital, with a 250-bed capacity, typically treats between 400 and 600 inpatients daily, 50-60 of whom are estimated to be refugees. It suffers from overcrowding, with a bed occupancy rate over 200%, poor infection control, and inadequate hygiene protocol and waste management. While it has six intensive care unit (ICU) beds available, the ICU is reportedly not functional due to lack of trained staff and functional equipment. However, the health cluster and its partners are planning to expand the health system capacity, including increasing beds and staffing. Currently, there are an estimated 0.31 physicians and 0.12 nurses per 1,000 population in Bangladesh, far below the 4.5 skilled health workers per 1,000 population recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO).\nIn this study, we aim to understand how SARS-CoV-2 might impact refugee camp populations, using the Rohingya refugees living in the Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site as a case study. The primary aims of this analysis are to (1) develop a baseline expectation of the possible infection burden, speed, and hospitalization capacity needed to respond to a COVID-19 epidemic; (2) use these findings to provide some recommendations to support ongoing preparedness planning by the Bangladesh government, United Nations agencies, and other actors for a COVID-19 outbreak; and (3) apply lessons from this case study to refugees and other forcibly displaced persons globally.\nMethods\nWe used a stochastic Susceptible Exposed Infectious Recovered (SEIR) mathematical model to simulate transmission in this population. To capture the potential variability of transmission possible in this setting, we simulated epidemics under three potential scenarios with different values of the basic reproductive number, R0: (1) a low transmission scenario based on transmission levels in many of the Chinese provinces with elevated isolation and control practices and an R0 similar to influenza (R0 = 1.5-2.0); (2) a moderate transmission scenario that mirrors estimates in early stages of the outbreak in Wuhan, China (R0 = 2.0-3.0); and (3) a high transmission scenario where we assume that R0 is increased by a factor of 1.65 (R0 = 3.3-5.0) compared to estimates from other settings, as was observed during the 2017 diphtheria outbreak. The R0 in each of these scenarios falls within the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the current range of estimates for COVID-19. We assumed an Erlang-distributed serial interval (time between the onset of symptoms in infector-infectee pairs) with a mean of 6 days (standard deviation [SD] = 4.2). We assumed a population of 600,000 individuals and that the population was essentially closed (i.e., no movement, births, or deaths other than from COVID-19). Population characteristics and parameters used are detailed in Table 1, and further details about the model are in S1 Text.\nPopulation characteristics and parameter values used in the model to estimate the transmission and impact of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site.\nParameter	Value (range)	Source	 	Population			 	Size	600,000	UNHCR 2019 	 	Median age	16 years	UN WPP 2019	 	Proportion female	not accounted for	-	 	Transmission			 	Basic reproductive number, R0			 	    Low transmission	1.5-2.0	White et al. 2009 	 	    Moderate transmission	2.0-3.0	Kucharski et al. 2020 	 	    High transmission	3.3-5.0	Truelove et al. 2019 	 	Mean incubation period	5.2 days	Lauer et al. 2020 	 	Infectious period	6 days (SD = 4.2)	Bi et al. 2020 	 	Hospitalization and death			 	Proportion of infections resulting in hospitalization	0.036 (95% CI, 0.012-0.093)	estimated1	 	Proportion of hospitalizations resulting in ICU admission	0.32	Huang et al. 2020 	 	Proportion of hospitalization resulting in death	0.10	Huang et al. 2020 	 	Time from onset to hospitalization	median: 3.42 days (SD: 0.79 days)	Bi et al. 2020 	 	Time from hospitalization to discharge	11.5 days (95% CI, 8.0-17.3)	Sanche et al. 2020 	 	Time from hospitalization to ICU admission	median: 8.25 days (IQR, 4.8-14.0)	Zhang et al. 2020 	 	Time from hospitalization to death	11.2 days (95% CI, 8.7-14.9)	Sanche et al. 2020 	 	Birth rate	0	-	 	\n1see S1 Text for details.\nAbbreviations: CI, confidence interval; ICU, intensive care unit; SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; SD, standard deviation; UNHCR, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees; WPP, World Population Prospects\nIn addition to the population size and potential for elevated transmission (scenario 3), we also accounted for the age of this population in our estimates of severity and death, following consistent findings that age is a primary indication for severity and death. We estimated the probability that an infection results in severe disease with a logistic generalized addative model with a penalized cubic spline for age and a random effect for study, using data from five studies. We aggregated predictions from this model into estimates for 10-year age groups and then applied those estimates to the age distribution of Kutupalong-Balukhali to get an overall probability that an infection that will develop into severe disease in this population (see S1 Text for more details). However, it should be noted that our estimates of severe disease and death do not account for differences in comorbidities, differing attack rates by age due to population mixing characteristics, or various other factors.\nWe assume that, in this setting, hospitalization would be limited to those with severe disease (defined as tachypnea [&gt;=30 breaths/minute] or oxygen saturation &lt;=93% at rest, or PaO2/FIO2 &lt;300, and/or lung infiltrates &gt;50% of the lung field within 24-48 hours) and not used as a means of isolation. Thus, we assumed the proportion hospitalized was equivalent to the age-adjusted severe disease proportion calculated for the population and applied this to incident infections from the model simulations. We assumed 32% of severe cases would require intensive care. We estimated deaths assuming a 10% case fatality risk rate among hospitalizations/severe disease, as was observed for SARS. We conservatively did not account for potential increases in mortality when healthcare resources are exhausted. We assumed hospitalization occurs a median of 3.42 days after symptom onset (lognormally distributed, SD = 0.79), hospitalized cases are discharged after a mean of 11.5 days (95% CI, 8.0-17.3), and deaths occur after a mean of 11.2 days (95% CI, 8.7-14.9).\nResults\nOur results suggest that a large-scale outbreak is likely in this population, even under the low transmission scenario, with 61% of the 1,000 simulations producing an outbreak of at least 1,000 people infected with a single introduction (Table 2) and increasing to 80% and 92% in the moderate and high transmission scenarios, respectively. On average, in the first 30 days of an outbreak following a single introduction, the estimated number of people infected ranges from 18 in the low transmission scenario to 370 in the high (Table 3). One year after the start of an outbreak, and in the absence of any effective interventions (e.g., vaccination, quarantine) or behavior change, between 73% (439,900/600,000; 95% prediction interval [PI], 62%-81%) and 98% (589,800/600,000, 95% PI, 96%-99%) of the population will have been infected (low and high transmission scenarios) (Table 2).\nOverall impact of simulated outbreaks in Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site, assuming no effective novel interventions or behavior change.\nTotal number of people infected, total hospitalizations, and total deaths represent the final cumulative counts after the simulated outbreak has run its full course, among simulations that resulted in outbreaks of at least 1,000 people infected. Maximum daily incident counts are the maximum incident counts of people infected and hospitalization on a single day across the full outbreak, occurring at the outbreak's peak. We estimated the daily hospitalization capacity needed in beds using incident hospitalizations and assuming hospitalized individuals remain hospitalized for a mean of 11.5 days (95% CI, 8.0-17.3). We estimated the largest number of beds needed at any time over the course the outbreak, which we report as the maximum capacity needed. From the daily bed capacity needed over time, we also estimate the day on which this capacity needed exceeds the existing capacity of 340 beds, which we report as the day on which hospitalization need exceeds capacity.\nTransmission scenario	Probability of outbreak of &gt;1,000 people infected after a single introduction	Total number of people infected  mean (95% PI)	Total hospitalizations of severe cases  mean (95% PI)	Total deaths  mean (95% PI)	Peak daily incident number of people infected  mean (95% PI)	Peak daily incident hospitalizations  mean (95% PI)	Peak hospitalization capacity needed (in beds)  mean (95% PI)	Day on which hospitalization need exceeds capacity   mean (95% PI)	 	Low (R0= 1.5-2.0)	61%	439,900 (378,200-484,700)	21,300 (17,100-26,600)	2,130 (1,700-2,660)	7,840 (5,060-10,470)	1,260 (690-2,290)	5,210 (3,120-8,090)	136 (96-196)	 	Moderate (R0= 2.0-3.0)	80%	546,800 (499,300-567,000)	26,500 (20,400-33,600)	2,650 (2,030-3,380)	17,200 (11,610-20,400)	2,400 (1,270-4,290)	10,240 (6,310-15,660)	81 (60-114)	 	High (R0= 3.3-5.0)	92%	589,800 (578,800-595,600)	28,800 (21,100-38,500)	2,880 (2,090-3,830)	28,480 (23,460-32,380)	3,640 (1,920-6,920)	15,450 (9,500-23,990)	55 (42-77)	 	\n Among simulations with successful introductions that result in outbreaks.\n  Current hospitalization capacity is estimated to be 340 beds.\nAbbreviations: CI, confidence interval; PI, prediction interval\nCumulative number of people infected, hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and deaths at 1, 3, and 12 months following successful introduction of simulations where an outbreak occurs.\nTransm-ission scenario	1 month	3 months	12 months	 	Number of people infected	Hospital-izations	ICU	Deaths	Number of people infected	Hospital-izations	ICU	Deaths	Number of people infected	Hospital-izations	ICU	Deaths	 	Low(R0= 1.5-2.0)	18 (2-65)	1 (0-3)	0 (0-1)	0 (0-0)	2,127 (37-10,655)	71 (1-374)	6 (0-30)	3 (0-15)	421,500 (376,300-463,500)	20,500 (16,700-25,000)	6,500 (5,400-8,000)	2,040 (1,660-2,500)	 	Moderate(R0= 2.0-3.0)	54 (3-223)	1 (0-6)	0 (0-1)	0 (0-0)	125,838 (1,920-411,000)	4,000 (48-16,700)	183 (1-990)	123 (1-631)	546,800 (499,300-567,000)	26,500 (20,400-33,600)	8,500 (6,500-10,800)	2,650 (2,030-3,380)	 	High(R0= 3.3-5.0)	370 (4-1,850)	6 (0-28)	0 (0-1)	0 (0-1)	542,800 (260,300-594,300)	25,000 (5,900-37,200)	4,440 (98-10,100)	1,880 (94-3,440)	589,800 (578,800-595,600)	28,800 (21,100-38,500)	9,200 (6,700-12,300)	2,880 (2,090-3,830)	 	\nAbbreviation: ICU, intensive care unit\nIn all scenarios, we observed relatively slow growth during the beginning of the simulated outbreaks (Fig 1), with limited numbers of people infected and few, if any, hospitalizations and deaths during the first month after the introduction of one infectious case (Table 3). However, this quickly changed once sufficient infections were in the population, with cases rapidly increasing and the outbreaks culminating within the year (Table 3, Fig 1). By the time the first hospitalization occurs, we expect 50 (95% PI, 1-197) individuals to be infected in the population under the low scenario, assuming homogeneous probability of infection by age. This increases to 72 (95% PI, 2-289) and 141 (95% PI, 3-502) in the moderate and high scenarios, respectively. When the first hospitalization occurs, we expect the virus to have been circulating in this population for an average of 38, 30, and 23 days under the low, moderate, and high transmission scenarios, respectively.\nSimulated outbreak trajectories for Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site camps under three transmission scenarios: low transmission (R0 = 1.5-2.0), moderate transmission (R0 = 2.0-3.0), and high transmission (R0 = 3.3-5.0).\n(A) Daily incident number of people infected by COVID-19, (B) daily incident hospitalizations, and (C) daily deaths under the three scenarios. The solid lines represent the mean outbreak trajectories, and the shading represents the 95% PIs of each scenario. PI, prediction interval.\nAdjusted for the age distribution in the Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site, we estimated that 4.8% (95% PI, 0.3%-15%) of infections in this population would result in severe disease and hospitalization. The maximum daily hospitalization capacity needed ranges between 5,210 (95% PI, 3,120-8,090) in the low transmission scenario and 15,450 (95% PI, 9,500-23,990) beds in the high (Table 2). Under the low transmission scenario, hospitalization needs exceeded the hospitalization capacity of 340 beds after 136 days (95% PI, 96-196 days), while in the high transmission scenario, this occurred after only 55 days (95% PI, 42-77 days; Table 2, Fig 2). Within 3 months of successful introduction, we estimated 6 (95% PI, 0-30) cumulative ICU admissions in the low transmission scenario compared to 4,400 (95% PI, 98-10,100) in the high transmission scenario (Table 3).\nHospitalization capacity requirements for an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in the Kutupalong-Balukhali camps, under three transmission scenarios: low transmission (R0 = 1.5-2.0), moderate transmission (R0 = 2.0-3.0), and high transmission (R0 = 3.3-5.0).\nThe solid lines represent the mean outbreak trajectories and the shading represents the 95% PIs of each scenario. The dashed red line represents the 340-bed surge capacity currently believed to exist in the population. PI, prediction interval; SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.\nAssuming that 10% of severe cases result in death, which puts the infection fatality rate at 0.48% (95% PI, 0.03%-1.5%), we estimated between 2,130 (95% PI, 1,700-2,660) and 2,880 (95% PI, 2,090-3,830) deaths from the low to high transmission scenarios (Table 2). In the high transmission scenario, the maximum number of daily hospitalizations is reached on day 80, compared to day 117 and day 190 on average in the low and moderate scenarios, respectively (Fig 1). Current hospital bed surge capacity (630) as reported from the site may almost double the number of available beds, which would delay overwhelming the capacity by 3-10 days on average (S2 Table).\nDiscussion\nThe Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site has 23 congested settlements, with nearly 600,000 persons residing there. Despite numerous challenges to the health of the population, including diphtheria and measles outbreaks, the health response and the resilience of the Rohingya refugees has been strong. However, the situation remains precarious and a COVID-19 outbreak in these camps would overload an already fragile health system and poor baseline health status. Using a stochastic disease transmission model, we estimated the number of people infected, hospitalizations, and deaths across three transmission scenarios after a successful introduction of SARS-CoV-2 into the Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site. The introduction of SARS-CoV-2 into the Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site or any other large refugee or internally displaced persons (IDPs) camp or settlement is likely to have serious consequences and overwhelm existing health systems. Even when transmission rates were assumed to be similar to that of influenza (low scenario), the necessary hospitalization capacities far exceeded the available capacities for the refugees in the expansion site in most simulations. Recent experience with other infectious disease outbreaks shows that the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 will likely be more intense in contexts such as the Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site than in out-of-camp settings because of high population density, inadequate water and soap to maintain hygiene, limited ability to isolate infected individuals, and large household sizes.\nThe younger demographic profile of the Rohingya camp population could reduce the overall rate of severe cases as compared with China or other upper-middle and high-income countries that have older populations. After adjusting for age, we estimate the overall severe disease rate among infections in this population (mean = 4.8%, [95% PI, 0.3%-15%]) to be approximately half what we estimated for China (mean = 10.1% [95% PI, 1.8%-32%]) using the same methods (S1 Text). However, it is likely that comorbidities such as malnutrition, concomitant diseases, and poor overall health status could cause more severe outcomes among these groups, which was not captured by our model.\nExisting inpatient facilities in the camps are already operating close to full bed occupancy, and all scenarios show that they will be overwhelmed. Under current conditions, we expect this to occur within 2 to 4.5 months (55 to 136 days) of the first introduction of the virus, with cumulative hospitalizations reaching 71 to 25,000 in the first 3 months, depending upon the scenario; these numbers rise dramatically by 12 months. Current hospital bed surge capacity as reported from the site may almost double the number of available beds, but even then, it only delays overwhelming the capacity by 3-10 days on average. Furthermore, while we have focused on the health needs of severe cases, health centers will be flooded with patients with mild to moderate symptoms also seeking care.\nWhile we were unable to find an accurate recent estimate of the human resources currently available in the camps (e.g., number of doctors, nurses, midwives), it is extremely likely that they will be inadequate to face a large influx of patients. Given the limited availability of skilled health workers and hospital beds in Cox's Bazar, it is unlikely that an additional influx of healthcare professionals within Bangladesh would be available. A surge of international healthcare workers could be considered, but this will be difficult given the high demands worldwide during the pandemic and existing travel restrictions. Furthermore, issues of introduction of the virus from expatriates into Bangladesh would need to be carefully addressed. A more likely strategy will be task shifting among existing healthcare workers, with physicians treating the most severe cases, nurses the less severe cases, and community health workers addressing mild infections. Such task shifting would require intensive training that needs to begin immediately. An examination of the &quot;repurposing&quot; of people working in various capacities (e.g., teachers as schools are closed) needs to be undertaken to assess how they can be used to address this epidemic while ensuring integration and complementarity of the response. Prepositioning of personal protective equipment (PPE) and comprehensive training that is constantly reinforced to reduce healthcare worker exposures are critical to avoid sickness and death among this essential cadre. In particular, the community health workers will have to adapt their method of working to reduce chances of getting infected or infecting others. This may require using texts and calling people in the Rohingya dialect to ensure culturally appropriate communication and education. Furthermore, community health workers can help build trust among the Rohingya that contact tracing and isolation are necessary, and that they can have confidence in these services, given the long history of mistrust among the Rohingya and authorities in Rakhine state, Myanmar.\nGiven the limited number of beds for treating the predicted large number of severe COVID-19 cases in the expansion site, isolation through hospitalization, as is being done in other settings, will likely be very difficult. Alternative plans for the isolation of mild symptomatic infections are needed and are currently being discussed with the government of Bangladesh to help control such an outbreak, as was done during the 2017 diphtheria outbreak. Cholera treatment centers and diphtheria outbreak centers that are currently on standby are a low-hanging fruit for repurposing. Setting up inclusive and accessible temporary hospitals to triage mild cases in these populations will require significant support and coordination by the government, UN agencies, and NGOs and may be limited by physical availability of land. Therefore, detailed advanced planning of healthcare capacities, triage procedures, and isolation strategies should be finalized and shared widely as soon as possible to minimize the impact of an outbreak.\nNovel and previously untried strategies for social distancing and quarantine will likely be necessary to control transmission in this setting. While culturally difficult and requiring strong socialization, isolating people over 60 years of age and those designated medically vulnerable together, so-called shielding, could be considered. One possibility could be isolating such groups among a group of families and relatives who have confidence in one another. Consistent monitoring of fever and other symptoms combined with appropriate testing will be an integral part of this strategy. Any such shielding must be decided upon wholly by the community after much discussion. It would require sufficient resources to provide comprehensive care (e.g., food and supportive services) for the isolated community members. Because physical distancing will be extremely difficult, the use of face masks among those most at risk, and possibly the whole population, could be considered if there are eventually sufficient supplies. Rapid and creative solutions for improving hand hygiene, such as the installation of handwashing stations and distribution of hand sanitizer, combined with communication campaigns, will be needed. Access to accurate and consistent health information will be critical, as already rumors and misinformation have spread among Rohingya refugees about COVID-19, partly due to camp-wide restrictions on the internet and telecommunications. In the future, the use of people who have recovered from COVID-19 infections will need to be considered, after more data become available as to their ability to become reinfected and transmit to others, as was done with Ebola survivors. The COVID-19-specific programs suggested above will require a strong surveillance system with adequate testing, case finding and isolation, as well as other supplies such as PPE. Such systems and supplies are not yet feasible in the camps but will be essential to address the epidemic in this setting.\nThe three scenarios show varying degrees of increased mortality. Mortality due to COVID-19 is dependent upon various factors, particularly access to hospitals with ICUs and ventilators. Currently, there is only one facility with few mechanical ventilators in the camps and one facility with fewer than 10 ICU beds and no ventilators. Therefore, it is likely that mortality rates due to COVID-19 will be significantly higher here than in settings where nationals or refugees have such access. Reportedly, the ICUs and ventilators are not functioning in the district hospital in Cox's Bazar, and thus access to healthcare facilities to treat severe cases of COVID-19 may be equally challenging for nationals. All-cause mortality in the Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site is currently comparable to estimates for Chittagong division and nationwide, and are below emergency levels. However, the scenarios show a significant increase in mortality, ranging from 2,040 deaths (3.4/1,000/year) to 2,880 deaths (4.8/1,000/year) at 12 months due to COVID-19 alone; this does not take into account expected deaths that would have occurred during this time, as well as increased deaths due to other illnesses that are untreated due to the outbreak.\nAs in other major epidemics where healthcare capacity and access to it is already limited, major outbreaks like this can easily disrupt an already precarious health system. Diversion of these limited health resources from existing health services, including vaccination, obstetrical care, and emergency care, may cause an increase in mortality due to disease that could normally be treated by the health system; this occurred in the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, where more people died from malaria than Ebola, and in Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, where more people died from measles than Ebola. Such an increase in non-COVID-19 mortality is particularly concerning with the upcoming monsoon season in Bangladesh.\nThere are several limitations to this study. We are using a mass-action model, which tends to overestimate the size of outbreaks because populations are generally not closed and well mixed. However, due to the population density and often closed nature of refugee camps, transmission in these settings has been shown to act more closely to theory. Additionally, the current evidence on the natural history and key epidemiological properties of COVID-19 reflects the interactions of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with non-displaced populations, and even in those populations, many of these parameters remain poorly defined. Population structure and population health can lead to a widely different burden of disease, with no modifications to the virus. With the particular demographic characteristics and health status of refugee populations, like this one in Cox's Bazar, we need to be cautious when developing guidance based on previously estimated properties of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19. Clinical surveillance, laboratory confirmation, and documentation are key to generating new evidence specific to this population and potentially generalizable to other refugee settings. Thus, we used the existing data that were available from documents and personal communications.\nWhile we are focused here on the possible impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site, most of these findings are applicable to other refugee and IDP camp-like situations. While governments' preparedness and response plans for COVID-19 may mention forcibly displaced populations, it is the details, or lack of, that must be examined. The Inter-Agency Standing Committee recently released interim guidance for scaling up the COVID-19 response in camps and camp-like settings that highlights inclusion, protection, and readiness; and has since developed preliminary multisectoral preparedness and response plans. This guidance, which applies the WHO guidance on COVID-19 preparedness and response to populations in humanitarian crises, should be acknowledged in government and humanitarian agency decision-making.\nClear and detailed COVID-19 plans that explicitly state how existing programs will be adapted according to their context should be developed and shared as soon as possible to allow for preparation. For example, different methods of food and fuel distribution will need to be undertaken that address social distancing issues. Potential consequences that isolation and other adaptive programming may cause, such as an increase in intimate partner violence, physical and sexual abuse among unaccompanied minors and other vulnerable groups, and mental health issues, should also be considered, and planned for in a concrete manner. Such adaptive programming will be an iterative process, as these are exceptional circumstances, and we will all have to learn by trying different approaches and then to document the results. A portal should be established by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the global health cluster, led by WHO, to document how such adaptive programs for refugees and IDPs are being undertaken in different contexts. There will be a need for increased funding and basic supplies, including PPE as well as large-scale testing capabilities, if these plans are to succeed.\nThe scenarios presented in this study focus on camp-like settings, where refugee populations are relatively accessible and health services are available and generally free. However, the majority of refugees reside outside of camps, often in urban contexts. For these populations, availability, access, cost, and quality of health services vary by host government policies. These refugee populations are also particularly vulnerable to the serious consequences of pandemics as targeted responses among a dispersed group of refugees, and equity in health service delivery is very difficult to achieve.\nDuring exceptional times, it is not unreasonable for governments to take extraordinary measures to protect their citizens; in fact, that is what is expected of governments. Therefore, while difficult for governments to state openly at this point, it is possible that many countries will restrict access to their hospitals to nationals only, particularly when there are large numbers of refugees in the same geographical area. We are already seeing governments closing their border to nonnationals and, in some cases, not allowing people to seek asylum. Such a predicament leaves refugees and other nonnationals, such as undocumented migrants, in an extremely precarious position. During a pandemic, there will be limited support by countries to establish field hospitals with ICU capabilities for refugees in camp-like settings, as they will be occupied with addressing their own national response. Unfortunately, there is no simple recommendation as to how to address this issue. However, we believe it is important to acknowledge the likelihood that host countries' hospitals will be closed to refugees in most camp-like settings, and, consequently, COVID-19 preparedness and response plans should proceed based on realistic scenarios.\nFinally, refugees face discrimination and are often falsely accused of spreading disease. The widespread rise of populism combined with anti-migrant and anti-refugee sentiments that we are observing globally provides a hostile environment that could be exacerbated by a pandemic. We are concerned that the COVID-19 pandemic, while completely unrelated to being a refugee, could be used as an excuse to take retribution against refugees, as well as other vulnerable groups such as IDPs and undocumented migrants. Such retribution could take many forms, including restricting or stopping asylum seekers, which is currently occurring, the closure of camps, and forced repatriation (refoulement, which is against refugee law), all used in the name of public health. Not only would this be morally wrong, it would jeopardize the effectiveness of containment and mitigation measures, as pandemics require planning and responses that do not discriminate by nationality, and protect the health of the global population.\nOur findings suggest a COVID-19 epidemic among the Rohingya refugees in the Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site will be extremely difficult to mitigate. Many of the current interventions such as social distancing, contact tracing and isolation, good hygiene, and sophisticated treatment in ICUs for critical cases will be challenging to implement. How SARS-CoV-2 will transmit and how COVID-19 will manifest in such a population, with a poor baseline heath status and acute malnutrition, is simply unknown at present. Beyond preparing now for COVID-19 through specific and sensitive interventions for this population to reduce morbidity and mortality, it is also important to rigorously document what does occur when the epidemic affects such a refugee population so we can learn how to better prepare and respond in similar settings. This will require strong surveillance systems to be established now. It will require working closely with the community to better understand how social distancing can work for them in their situation. And it will require the continued commitment of healthcare workers and the refugees themselves to respond to this pandemic.\nSupporting information\nAbbreviations\nCI\nconfidence interval\nICU\nintensive care unit\nIDP\ninternally displaced person\nNGO\nnongovernmental organization\nPHC\nprimary healthcare center\nPI\nprediction interval\nPPE\npersonal protective equipment\nSARS-CoV-2\nsevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\nSD\nstandard deviation\nSEIR\nSusceptible Exposed Infectious Recovered\nUN WPP\nUnited Nations World Population Prospects\nUNHCR\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees\nReferences\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.

Dynamics in Wuhan, China, of Novel Coronavirus–Infected Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nThe initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7121484","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Massachusetts Medical

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship

characterisation and epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and

course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

Primary articles were identified by English-language Pubmed/MEDLINE, Cochrane central register of controlled trials, and Cochrane systemic review database search (1960–June 2009) using the MeSH headings: ARDS, adult respiratory distress syndrome, ARDS, corticosteroids, and methylprednisolone (MP).\n The identified studies were reviewed and information regarding role of corticosteroids in prevention and treatment of ARDS was evaluated.\n Nine trials have evaluated the role of corticosteroid drugs in management of ARDS at various stages.\n Of the 9, 4 trials evaluated role of corticosteroids in prevention of ARDS, while other 5 trials were focused on treatment after variable periods of onset of ARDS.\n Trials with preventive corticosteroids, mostly using high doses of MP, showed negative results with patients in treatment arm, showing higher mortality and rate of ARDS development.\n While trials of corticosteroids in early ARDS showed variable results, somewhat, favoring use of these agents to reduce associated morbidities.\n In late stage of ARDS, these drugs have no benefits and are associated with adverse outcome.\n Use of corticosteroids in patients with early ARDS showed equivocal results in decreasing mortality; however, there is evidence that these drugs reduce organ dysfunction score, lung injury score, ventilator requirement, and intensive care unit stay.\n However, most of these trials are small, having a significant heterogeneity regarding study design, etiology of ARDS, and dosage of corticosteroids.\n Further research involving large-scale trials on relatively homogeneous cohort is necessary to establish the role of corticosteroids for this

pulmonary edema or accelerating its resorption through the modulation of fluid intake or oncotic pressure could be beneficial.\n This review discusses the principal clinical studies that have made it possible to progress in the optimization of the fluid state during ARDS.\n Notably, a randomized, multicenter study has suggested that fluid management with the goal to obtain zero fluid balance in ARDS patients without shock or renal failure significantly increases the number of days without mechanical ventilation.\n On the other hand, it is accepted that patients with hemodynamic failure must undergo early and adapted vascular filling.\n Liberal and conservative filling strategies are therefore complementary and should ideally follow each other in time in the same patient whose hemodynamic state progressively stabilizes.\n At present, although albumin treatment has been suggested to improve oxygenation transiently in ARDS patients, no sufficient evidence justifies its use to mitigate pulmonary edema and reduce respiratory morbidity.\n Finally, the resorption of alveolar edema occurs through an active mechanism, which can be pharmacologically upregluated.\n In this sense, the use of beta-2 agonists may be beneficial but further studies are needed to confirm preliminary promising

immigrants from low- and middle-income countries and host country women.\n\n The present study identified suboptimal factors related to care-seeking, accessibility, and quality of care for maternal deaths that occurred in Sweden from 1988–2010.\nMethods\nA subset of maternal death records (n?=?75) among foreign-born women from low- and middle-income countries and Swedish-born women were audited using structured implicit review.\n\n One case of foreign-born maternal death was matched with two native born Swedish cases of maternal death.\n\n An assessment protocol was developed that applied both the ‘migration three delays’ framework and a modified version of the Confidential Enquiry from the United Kingdom.\n\n The main outcomes were major and minor suboptimal factors associated with maternal death in this high-income, low-maternal mortality context.\n\n\nResults\nMajor and minor suboptimal factors were associated with a majority of maternal deaths and significantly more often to foreign-born women (p?=?0.01).\n\n The main delays to care-seeking were non-compliance among foreign-born women and communication barriers, such as incongruent language and suboptimal interpreter system or usage.\n\n Inadequate care occurred more often among the foreign-born (p?=?0.04), whereas delays in consultation/referral and miscommunication between health care providers where equally common between the two groups.\n\n\nConclusions\nSuboptimal care factors, major and minor, were present in more than 2/3 of maternal deaths in this high-income setting.\n\n Those related to migration were associated to miscommunication, lack of professional interpreters, and limited knowledge about rare diseases and pregnancy complications.\n\n Increased insight into a migration perspective is advocated for maternity clinicians who provide care to foreign-born women.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3998732","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed

Surveys data for malaria prevalence and coverage of malaria interventions before the Ebola outbreak.\n\n We then removed the effect of treatment and hospital care to estimate additional cases and

administration in affected areas on malaria cases and health-care demand.\n\n\nFindings\nid='P4'>If malaria care ceased as a result of the Ebola epidemic, untreated cases of malaria would have increased by 45% (95% credible interval 43–49) in Guinea, 88% (83–93) in Sierra Leone, and 140% (135–147) in Liberia in 2014.

patterns for fatal malaria in Tanzania","abstract":"Background\nOnce malaria occurs, deaths can be prevented by prompt treatment with relatively affordable and efficacious drugs.\n\n Yet this goal is elusive in Africa.\n\n The paradox of a continuing but easily preventable cause of high mortality raises important questions for policy makers concerning care-seeking and access to health systems.\n\n Although patterns of care-seeking during uncomplicated malaria episodes are well known, studies in cases of fatal malaria are rare.\n\n Care-seeking behaviours may differ between these groups.\n\n\nMethods\nThis study documents care-seeking events in 320 children less than five years of age with fatal malaria seen between 1999 and 2001 during over 240,000 person-years of follow-up in a stable perennial malaria transmission setting in southern Tanzania.\n\n Accounts of care-seeking recorded in verbal autopsy histories were analysed to determine providers attended and the sequence of choices made as the patients' condition deteriorated.\n\n\nResults\nAs first resort to care, 78.7% of malaria-attributable deaths used modern biomedical care in the form of antimalarial pharmaceuticals from shops or government or non-governmental heath facilities, 9.4% used initial traditional care at home or from traditional practitioners and 11.9% sought no care of any kind.\n\n There were no differences in patterns of choice by sex of the child, sex of the head of the household, socioeconomic status of the household or presence or absence of convulsions.\n\n In malaria deaths of all ages who sought care more than once, modern care was included in the first or second resort to care in 90.0% and 99.4% with and without convulsions respectively.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn this study of fatal malaria in southern Tanzania, biomedical care is the preferred choice of an overwhelming majority of suspected malaria cases, even those complicated by convulsions.\n\n Traditional care is no longer a significant delaying factor.\n\n To reduce mortality further will require greater emphasis on recognizing danger signs at home, prompter care-seeking, improved quality of care at health facilities and better adherence to treatment.\n\n\n","id":"PMC514497","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Don","surname":"de

The aim of this review is (i) to synthesize the evidence on risk of infection and transmission among migrants, refugees, asylum seekers and internally displaced populations, and (ii) the effect of lockdown measures on these populations. We searched MEDLINE and WOS, preprint servers, and pertinent websites between 1st December 2019 and 26th June 2020. The included studies showed a high heterogeneity in study design, population, outcome and quality. The incidence risk of SARS-CoV-2 varied from 0 12% to 2 08% in non-outbreak settings and from 5 64% to 21 15% in outbreak settings. Migrants showed a lower hospitalization rate compared to non-migrants. Negative impacts on mental health due to lockdown measures were found across respective studies. However, findings show a tenuous and heterogeneous data situation, showing the need for more robust and comparative study designs.\nIntroduction\nThe COVID-19 pandemic poses economic and health threats to people worldwide, especially to migrants and forcibly displaced populations, such as refugees, asylum seekers and internally displaced persons (IDP). Policy measures taken to mitigate the spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may exacerbate poor health conditions among these populations, or exacerbate conditions which create or add to pre-existing vulnerabilities. Especially low-wage labor migrants and forcibly displaced populations often live in crowded accommodations where they share rooms as well as cooking and sanitary facilities with a number of people outside their own household. Physical distancing and recommended hygiene measures are not feasible in many such contexts. Considering that 78 to 85% of human-to-human transmissions take place in family clusters and up to 10% on household level, these conditions are likely to increase the risk of infection and rapid dissemination among migrants and displaced populations. Precarious working conditions may add to these vulnerabilities, mainly in manual labor jobs e.g., agricultural or domestic work, that do not allow for protective measures like self-isolation, home-office, or physical distancing. This often leads to the loss of livelihoods due to the policy and lockdown measures taken, as it happened to many migrant workers in India under the national lockdown in March 2020.\nWhile the COVID-19 pandemic poses a threat to migrants and displaced populations, evidence on risk of infection, progress of disease, and effective prevention strategies is still lacking. An emerging body of evidence showed racial and ethnic disparities, with higher SARS-CoV-2 incidence in ethnic minorities compared to white persons. However, there is only a small number of studies investigating these aspects in migrants and displaced populations.\nThis review aims to synthesize the empirical evidence on risk of infection, transmission, development of disease, and risk of severe course of disease among migrants, refugees, asylum seekers and IDPs. The secondary objective is to review the evidence on the effects of lockdown measures on their health, and effective policy strategies to avert risks and negative outcomes. We thereby seek to summarise valuable information to inform future research in this field.\nMethods\nSearch strategy and selection criteria\nWe conceived a rapid systematic review (PROSPERO registration number CRD42020195633) based on recommendations by the Cochrane Rapid Reviews Methods Group.\nTo maintain quality while utilising resources efficiently, two underlying decisions have been made to accelerate the review process: the number of databases to search was restricted to two and the language of publication to English and German only.\nInclusion/Exclusion criteria.\nTable 1:	 	\nInclusion/Exclusion criteria	 	Criteria	Inclusion	Exclusion	 	Type of Population*	Refugees, asylum seekers, internally displaced people, and migrants	Unclear populations or reference to migrants and refugees without stratified results	 	Type of studies	Empirical quantitative studies (cross-sectional, case-control.

We conducted a systematic search query in MEDLINE via PubMed and Web of Science Core Collection (WOS) and searched in the major preprint servers medRxiv and bioRxiv to cover yet unpublished research results in this fast and early time of the current pandemic. The search included the time between 1st December 2019 and 26th June 2020 using English search terms for the study population and SARS-CoV-2 as exposure (for details on the search query see Supplementary File: Appendix A). Additional publications were identified on the websites of the International organization for Migration (IOM), the European Public Health Association (EUPHA), the World Health organization (WHO) COVID research, and the website of the systematic and living map on COVID-19 evidence of the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH). The website search was conducted by two independent researchers between the 25th and 29th of June 2020. The screening process was done in two steps. First, two researchers independently screened titles and abstracts by applying pre-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria (see Table 1).\nConflicts were resolved through discussion or, where no agreement was reached, by a third reviewer. In the next step, full text screening for eligible records was conducted by following the same procedure as the title and abstract screening. Due to the novelty of the current pandemic and the conception of this project as a rapid review, references of eligible articles were screened, and, alongside journal articles, peer-reviewed comments or letters to the editors were included, if they reported empirical data.\nQuality assessment\nThe quality appraisal of included studies was carried out independently and in duplicate. Quantitative studies were assessed using the tool of the Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP). Modelling studies were appraised using a self-developed instrument derived from existing tools.\nThe Covidence software was used for the screening of titles, abstract, and full-texts as well as for quality appraisal.\nData extraction and outcomes\nData extraction was performed in Excel 2016 by one reviewer (MH) using a piloted form and checked by a second reviewer (KB) for correctness and completeness of the extracted data. The data extraction form included the categories generic bibliographic information, study characteristics, study objectives, hypothesis and research questions, population, and context characteristics, as well as findings and results of the critical appraisal (see Supplementary File: Appendix B). Data extraction for this systematic review considered the primary studies, and the modelling studies included.\nPrimary outcomes were incidence risk of SARS-CoV-2 infections among migrant and forcibly displaced populations, and outcomes of infections (e.g. measured by hospitalisation, admissions to intensive care units (ICU), or mortality). Where reported, outcomes were extracted by subgroups (e.g. by nationality, or contextual information such as accommodation type). Secondary outcomes were the effects of lockdown measures on the health status of refugees, asylum seekers, IDPs and migrants, especially referring to mental health outcomes.\nEvidence synthesis and statistical analysis\nExtracted data was tabulated and summarised by narrative synthesis and, where applicable, by statistical meta-analysis. Numbers of SARS-CoV-2 cases and respective population size, including data on sub-groups, were visualised in a forest plot along with corresponding 95% confidence intervals calculated by the 'metaprop' command in STATA SE 15 (with the &quot;nooverall&quot; option to supress pooling of studies across subgroups due to high heterogeneity).\nRole of the funding source\nOverview of included studies.\nTable 2:	 	\nAuthor(s)	Date of Publication	Type of Publication	Type of Study	Context of Study/Setting	Country of Study	Socioeconomic Development of Country/Region	Population	Sample Size (migrant group)	Outcome measures	Main outcomes as reported	 	M.

Across the 111 ICE facilities examined in the study, and considering all three scenarios, the cumulative number of ICU admissions by day 90 for over half of facilities would exceed hospital capacity within a 10-mile radius. The impact on hospital capacity is lower if the radius was expanded to 50 miles, hovering around 8% of facilities exceeding ICU demand. These models do not take into account other concerns that would strain ICE's operational capacity at a time when staffing is likely to be a concern, such as the difficulty and risk to staff of repeatedly transporting and guarding detainees up to 50 miles distant from their facilities of origin. The timing and peak number of cases are driven by facility size, which also are important when considering preventive interventions.	 	S. Truelove, O. Abrahim, C. Altare, S. A. Lauer, K. H.

The introduction of SARS CoV-2 into the Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site or any other large refugee or internally displaced persons (IDPs) camp or settlement is likely to have serious consequences and overwhelm existing health systems. Even when transmission rates were assumed to be similar to that of influenza (low scenario), the necessary hospitalization capacities far exceeded the available capacities for the refugees in the expansion site in most simulations.

The study models use three scenarios. The Camp-population Scenario describes a situation whereby unmitigated spread in crowded displacement camps will lead to total health system collapse within the first four weeks of an outbreak. Considering that such a scenario can occur concurrently with Scenario Two (or a worse All-population Scenario Three not presented here whereby doubling rates and clinical attack rates would be higher), the epidemic outcomes can be catastrophic.

Despite the limitations of the data, it is possible to draw some general conclusions. The first noticeable result is that 0.27% of the suspect cases registered in the database corresponded to migrants originating from Central America, the Caribbean, Venezuela or an African country, a very high percentage if one considers that international immigrants in Mexico were only about 0.11% of the population in mid-2020 in Mexico. When it is taken into consideration that the majority of international immigrants in Mexico come from the United States, the difference is even more striking. The calculation of cases per 100,000 shows a similar picture, particularly in scenario 1. [...] This could be an underestimation of the actual number, as not all migrants aiming to cross are registered in the waiting lists that are the source of this data.	 	K. Kumar, A. Mehra, S.

All the migrants who screened positive for anxiety also screened positive for depression, suggesting high co-morbidity. Additionally, about one-fifth of the participants screened positive for only depression. Additionally, on the self-designed questionnaire, a significant proportion of participants reported a marked increase in negative emotions and feelings such as loneliness, tension, frustration, low mood, irritability, fear, fear of death, and social isolation.

Incident SARS-CoV-2 cases	From early April 2020, a marked escalation of new cases of COVID-19 was observed among low-skilled migrant workers living in dormitories in Singapore. By 6 May 2020, these infected workers formed 87.9% of the 20 198 cases of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Singapore.Unsatisfactory housing and social overcrowding in accommodation for low-skilled migrant workers need to be addressed before any pandemic occurs. If this is not done, epicentres of the disease can arise in these housing areas.	 	I. Motta, R. Centis, L. D'Ambrosio, J.-M. Garcia-Garcia, D. Goletti, G. Gualano, F. Lipani, F. Palmieri, A.

Such behaviors can particularly affect those individuals of Asian origin who are tending to wear face masks.Overall, these findings underscore the responsibility of different parties in overcoming and preventing discrimination during outbreaks of infectious diseases. Firstly, universities that host Asian students and staff from abroad should support their students during the outbreak (and any other future epidemic emerging from Asian region) and protect them from harmful misconceptions.

While this suggests that COVID-19 is much more prevalent in the refugee population, we cannot definitively exclude two alternative explanations. The first is that refugees experience higher rates of other common illnesses with overlapping symptoms. The second is that some refugees over report adverse life events and health outcomes, as some anecdotal evidence suggests.

No specific funding was received for this study. The corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study and the final responsibility to submit for publication.\nResults\nPRISMA Flow-Chart.\nFig. 1:\nThe searches resulted in a total of 973 hits, and after duplicate removal, 715 studies remained for screening. Of these, 133 records were included for full-text screening and 13 met all the inclusion criteria. Using the snowballing method, two further studies meeting the inclusion criteria were detected. In total, 15 studies were included in this review (Fig. 1).\nQuality appraisal using the EPHPP tool resulted in two studies at low risk of bias, four studies at moderate risk of bias, and six studies at high risk of bias. Appraisal of the modeling studies resulted in two studies at low risk of bias and one at high risk of bias. An overview of the quality appraisal is provided in the supplements [see detailed risk of bias assessment: Appendix C].\nAlmost half of the studies (n = 7) reported data from high-income countries (HIC), five studies reported from upper or low middle-income countries (MIC), and three studies reported from low-income countries (LIC). The studies covered the following migrant and forcibly displaced population groups: refugees, asylum seekers or IDPs (n = 5), migrant workers (n = 4), international students (n = 2), and migrants with no further specification (n = 2). The reported outcomes were incidence risks among migrant population groups, modelled transmission scenarios, physical health outcomes such as hospitalization, ICU admissions, or mortality, and mental or social impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on peoples' health or well-being (Table 2).\nIncidence risk\nForest plot of incidence risks (in %).\nLegend: Bojorquez et al.

(szenario 2): Population refers to the number of cases in the United States immigration courts assigned to the MPP program from March 2019 to March 2020; Trulove et al. (scenario 1): Basic reproduction number R0= 1 5-2 0; Trulove et al. (scenario 2): Basic reproduction number R0= 2 0-3 0; Trulove et al. (scenario 3): Basic reproduction number R0= 3 3-5 0; Hariri et al.*: Camp-population scenario with a very fast doubling rate of 2 3 days; Irvine et al.*: Only data from most optimistic scenario extracted (R0=2 5). Y-axis: percentage (%). ES: estimate of incidence proportion.\nFig. 2:\nThe incidence risk among the observational studies varied from 0 12% to 2 08% in non-outbreak settings, and from 5 64% to 21 15% in outbreak settings, showing a high heterogeneity across the studies. Modelling studies also showed a high heterogeneity, which is due to different scenarios and timeframes. Detailed estimates on migrants and forcibly displaced populations are plotted in Fig. 2.\nStudies with patient populations report lower incidence rates compared to populations in congested settings. However, the incidence risk varies among the different regions of origin of those infected (0 21-2 08%). Compared to the incidence risk for the Spanish estimated at 0 7%, significantly higher rates were reported by a pre-print study for individuals from Sub-Saharan-Africa, Caribbean, and Latin America. A high risk of bias study among migrants in transit in Mexico reports low incidence risks in two scenarios with 0 12% or 0 51% respectively. The estimated cumulative incidence in two scenarios (with different sources for the population size of asylum seekers in the US) showed a higher number of suspected cases per 100 000 in the migrant group compared to non-migrants. An ecological study investigating migrants in transit in Mexico found a higher Incidence Risk Ratio (IRR: 6 43, 95%CI, 4 41-9 39) for SARS-CoV-2 in state cluster populations with a higher proportion of migrants. Contextual factors, such as dormitories, were associated with incidence risks in migrant workers in the range of 5 64% (95%CI, 5 56-5 72) to 19 43% (95%CI, 18 75-20 12)[18] and 21 15% (95%CI, 20 12-22 21).\nAnother study assessed SARS-CoV-2 screening campaigns in different shelters and accommodation centres of homeless people and asylum seekers in Marseille, France. No SARS-CoV-2 cases were found among the asylum seekers tested on a voluntary basis, while among the 411 homeless people, facing similar living conditions, tested in different shelters 9% (n = 37) were tested positive.\nTransmission dynamics and hospitalisation\nTransmission scenarios were found to be slow in the beginning with a rapid increase of infections starting between the fourth week and the third month after start of simulated outbreaks. Irvine et al. found the speed of transmission in confined detention centres to be dependent on the facility size, starting with five infected individuals at baseline, where smaller facilities of 50 detainees reach the peak of infections earlier (day 19) than larger ones of 1000 detainees (day 69), assuming a moderate reproduction number of R(0)=3 5. This may be emphasised by the incidence risks of the modeling studies plotted in Fig. 2.\nFour studies assessed hospitalisation among the respective populations. Irvine et al. modelled hospitalisations in three different scenarios with reproduction numbers between R(0)=2 5 and R(0)=7 0. For the most pessimistic scenario (R(0)=7), models show that 15 1% of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainees would need hospitalisation. For a facility housing 1000 detainees, this would mean a range of hospitalization numbers between 10 and 117 at day 30 and between 114 and 157 at day 90 across all scenarios. Truelove et al. estimated 4 8% (95%PI, 0 3%-15%) of 600 000 Rohingya refugees living in a camp to be severe cases and in need of hospitalisation across the transmission scenarios. The authors calculated with reproduction rates between R(0)=1 5 and R(0)=5 0, also reaching up to 15% of hospitalisations in the worst case scenario. The model also computed the point in time when needs exceed the hospital capacity at the Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site in Bangladesh. In the low transmission scenario, this is the case after 136 days (95%PI, 96-196 days), and in the high transmission scenario after 55 days (95%PI, 42-77 days.). Among the observational studies Bojorquez et al. found a tendency of lower odds to be hospitalised in migrants in transit and asylum seekers in Mexico (adjusted OR for confirmed cases: 0 18 (CI95%, 0 2-1 53) compared to the Mexican population. In contrast, the odds of interstate migrants was 1 36 (95%CI, 1 19-1 54) times the odds of hospitalisation than the reference (Mexican) population. About 6 49% of all hospitalised SARS-CoV-2 cases in Mexico from 28th February until 21st April 2020 were interstate migrants. However, the IRR for hospitalisation in state cluster populations with a higher proportion of migrants showed an inverse association (IRR: 0 65, 95%CI 0 58-0 74). A study among patient populations in Spain reports a 3-, 6-, and 7-fold higher risk among patients from Sub-Saharan-Africa, the Caribbean, and Latin America, respectively, of being PCR confirmed cases or being hospitalised compared to the Spanish patients.\nICU admission\nICU admission was only reported by modelling studies. Irvine et al. found approximately 1 8% of the ICE detainee-population in need of ICU after 90 days of detention assuming a low transmission scenario R(0)=2 5, and approximately 2 3% within the same time within a high transmission scenario R(0)=7. In comparison, the simulations of Trulove et al. result in lower estimates for ICU transmission in Rohingya refugees after three months' time, while using lower reproduction rates. Cumulative numbers of ICU admissions are ranging from 6 (0-30) to 4 440 (98-10 100) across the scenarios, which accounts for 0 0%-0 7% of the Rohingya refugee population. Hariri and colleagues calculate with a doubling rate of 2 3 leading to 12 000 (1%) critical cases in need of ICU admission among IDPs in camps and tented settlements along the Turkey-Syria border. Moreover, their scenario estimates a 50% overload of ICU capacity within the fourth week. Only one study used empirical instead of modeling data to investigate the need of intubation within a patient population and reports that 12 5% of migrants need intubation. However, due to a high number of missing values, these results are to be interpreted with caution. Risk conditions in this specific study population seemed to be less among migrants except for the case of pregnant women.\nMortality\nFive studies address mortality as an outcome variable. Proportions of migrants with a fatal outcome in the studied populations vary from 0 48% to 6 0% across the studies. The modelling study of Truelove et al. shows the lowest fatality rate with 0 48% (95%PI, 0 03%-1 5%) assuming that 10% of severe cases result in death. The model of Hariri and colleagues predicts 1 6% (n = 18 751) deaths within the first six weeks upon infection. The authors mention that numbers might be higher due to a lack of health facility capacity in northwest Syria for the treatment of severe and critical cases. Non-modelling studies report a mortality rate among interstate migrants of 4 75% (95%CI, 4 06-5 43) with an odds ratio for fatal outcomes of 2 01 (95%CI, 1 46-2 76) compared to average state-cluster characteristics. The IRR for lethality in state-clusters with higher proportions of migrants (IRR: 1 02, 95%CI, 0 98-1 02) showed a mild tendency to be higher in these populations. Guijarro et al. investigate SARS-CoV-2 cases at a hospital in Alcorcon, Spain, finding 33% of severe cases in migrants (defined by country of origin) compared to 63% in the Spanish population. Severe cases include death, critical care admission, and hospital stay longer than 7 days. Unadjusted mortality among severe cases was at 6% in the migrant and 25% among the Spanish population. Motta et al. also found a lower mortality rate in migrants (2 3%, n = 1, N = 43) compared to non-migrants (26 9%, n = 7, N = 26) in the investigated study population of tuberculosis patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.\nMental health outcomes and well-being\nMental and social wellbeing among different migrant groups was assessed in five studies. Kumar and colleagues found 73 5% out of 98 migrant workers in India to be screened positive for depression, anxiety, and/or perceived stress due to pandemic and lockdown measures measured by PHQ2, GAD2 and PSS-4 questionnaires. In line with that, Qiu et al. assessed psychological levels of distress among Chinese people during the COVID-19 pandemic finding the highest level of distress among migrant workers compared to other, non-migratory occupation groups.\nImpact on social and socio-psychological wellbeing was assessed among international students in central China's Hubei province, showing that almost a quarter of the study population talked about the virus in regular conversations and almost half of the study population was unhappy due to the current lockdown condition. Moreover, migrant workers in India reported a deterioration of social-wellbeing with 63 3% reporting increased loneliness and about half of the participants indicating a significant increase in negative feelings such as tension, frustration, irritability, and fear of death. Reduction of sleep and social connectedness affected about one third of the participating migrant workers in the same study. Another topic investigated by Lopez-Pena and colleagues were health behaviours of Rohingya refugees during the COVID-19 pandemic. The authors focused on health providers chosen by persons that showed symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 and at trusted information sources such as friends, newspapers or non-governmental organisations (NGO). A total of 42 3% (95%CI 32 4-52 3) of symptomatic household members in refugee camps chose pharmacies as their first-choice health provider followed by health information providers in camps (35 8% (95%CI 26 0-45 6)). Trusted information sources on COVID-19 prevention and advice among Rohingya refugees were friends, neighbours, and acquaintances (58 8% (95%CI 50 7-66 9)) followed by NGOs (53 5% (95%CI 45 6-61 3)) and informational campaigns on the streets (41 6% (95%CI 33 6-49 7)).\nRzymski and colleagues assessed prejudices against Chinese students studying at a university in Poland to assess social wellbeing. According to the survey, 61 2% of participants said that they experienced prejudices in public transport, shopping or in restaurants and in health services due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Racist behaviours were shown in preconceptions and rejective behaviours of others against Chinese international students resulting in negative impacts on their wellbeing.\nDiscussion\nThis systematic review has demonstrated a high heterogeneity of health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic in migrant and forcibly displaced populations, who are in turn a heterogenous group exposed to a wide range of living conditions. Compared to various non-migrant reference groups, the incidence risks reported among migrant and forcibly displaced populations tend to be consistently higher, while hospitalisation rates and ICU admissions seem to be lower among migrants. However, most findings for the latter are derived from modelling studies and may thus only approximate reality as, e.g. hospital bed and ICU capacity were not always considered. As expected based on knowledge from studies in general populations, the different transmission scenarios in modelling studies show an exponential increase in SARS-CoV-2 cases after the start of transmission within a migrant population. There was no substantial gain in evidence regarding mortality rates as results were mixed. Crude mortality rates derived from observational studies were higher among patient populations compared to population-based studies, but overall were lower among migrants compared to non-migrant populations. In contrast, a population-based study at moderate risk of bias found a higher lethality in populations with a higher proportion of migrants when adjusted for age and gender. All migrant and forcibly displaces populations investigated by the included studies, were exposed to precarious living and working conditions and hence were at a higher risk of becoming infected or severe cases. In addition, the evidence consistently suggests that mental health is negatively impacted by the pandemic situation across all migrant groups considered by this review. Apart from the reduction in social connectedness, migrant workers no longer have job security and are therefore strongly affected by lockdown measures. However, as there is a lack of comparative studies assessing whether migrants and forcibly displaced populations suffer to a different extent from the pandemic measures compared to native reference populations, generalised conclusions cannot yet be drawn in this respect.\nOverall, we found a heterogeneous and fragmented research landscape studying the health of migrants and forcibly displaced populations during the COVID-19 pandemic, few high-quality studies, and a scarcity of comparative designs.\nThere is a need for more analytical studies using robust comparative study design to monitor inequalities regarding exposure to SARS-CoV-2 or related pandemic policies. This requires a strengthening of health information systems, that however, due to weak capacities, are falling short of instantly generating and providing health information data on migrants, asylum seekers, refugees and IDPs. Moreover, no qualitative studies were available at the time our search was conducted. Many researchers and organisations already called for the integration of vulnerable population groups such as refugees and migrants into national policy plans and qualitative studies are instrumental to provide insights into realities of migrant and forcibly displaced population groups during the pandemic. At structural level, and as long as medical remedies are absent, improving living conditions of these groups by ensuring preconditions that allow for self-isolation, physical distancing, and hygiene appear to be the best preventive policy measures to protect migrants and forcibly displaced populations from being particularly exposed to SARS-CoV-2.\nStrengths and limitations\nTo our knowledge, and beyond a bibliometric analysis of SARS-CoV-2 research and migration, this is one of the first reviews to investigate empirical data available on migrant populations at this stage of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe conception of this review as a rapid systematic review made it possible to conduct search, screening, quality appraisal, data extraction and synthesis in a timely manner. At the same time, we had to compromise by restricting the study languages to English and German, which poses a possible limitation to identify all empirical data available on this topic so far. The heterogeneity of studies did not allow for running a meta-analysis with pooled estimates to gain further knowledge about the incidence risk in migrant populations.\nFurthermore, the body of evidence included is limited by a scarcity of high-quality studies and prone to a wide range of bias (hospital bias, diagnostic bias, selection bias, and misclassification bias) or residual confounding. Mortality studies, for example, did not always adjust for age and comorbidity when comparing migrants and non-migrants (see detailed risk of bias assessment: Appendix C). The inclusion of pre-prints, comments, or letters to the editor reporting empirical data was also a challenge for quality appraisal. Nevertheless, this was necessary in order to find as much empirical data as possible, at the early stage of the pandemic when our search was conducted. Given the dynamic number of SARS-CoV-2 related publications, updates of the rapid review will be required in regular intervals to synthesise and consider emerging evidence.\nConclusion\nThe summarised evidence in this rapid systematic review on SARS-CoV-2 among migrant and forcibly displaced populations shows high incidence risks among migrants, refugees, asylum seekers and IDPs, yet low hospital admission rates, and mixed mortality-related results. Due to the tenuous and heterogenous data situation on which the review is based on, results need to be interpreted with caution. In view of the general scarcity of health data on migrant and forcibly displaced populations, the pandemic might rather be a barrier than a facilitator to improve the body of evidence. More robust and comparative study designs are urgently needed to assess differences and inequalities in risk of infection, consequences of disease, contextual risk factors, and impact of pandemic policies among migrants and forcibly displaced populations. This might include strengthening of health information systems and integration of these groups in notification and reporting systems at all levels of the healthcare system.\nFunding\nThis research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.\nAuthor contributions\nConceptualization: KB, MH.\nData curation: KB, HG, MH, MT, KK, JS, CH.\nFormal Analysis and Investigation: KB, MH\nValidation: JS, MT, SR, HG, KK, CH\nVisualization: MH, KB\nWriting original draft: MH, KB\nWriting - review &amp; editing: MH, KB, JS, MT, SR, HG, KK, CH\nEthics statement\nThe study is based on published literature, no ethical clearance was required.\nCompeting interests\nThe work has been conducted in the scope of the German Competence Net Public Health Covid-19.

concepts and methods","abstract":"Background\nComputer simulation models are used increasingly to support public health research and policy, but questions about their quality persist.\n\n The purpose of this article is to review the principles and methods for validation of population-based disease simulation models.\n\n\nMethods\nWe developed a comprehensive framework for validating population-based chronic disease simulation models and used this framework in a review of published model validation guidelines.\n\n Based on the review, we formulated a set of recommendations for gathering evidence of model credibility.\n\n\nResults\nEvidence of model credibility derives from examining: 1) the process of model development, 2) the performance of a model, and 3) the quality of decisions based on the model.\n\n Many important issues in model validation are insufficiently addressed by current guidelines.\n\n These issues include a detailed evaluation of different data sources, graphical representation of models, computer programming, model calibration, between-model comparisons, sensitivity analysis, and predictive validity.\n\n The role of external data in model validation depends on the purpose of the model (e.\n\ng.\n\n, decision analysis versus prediction).\n\n More research is needed on the methods of comparing the quality of decisions based on different models.\n\n\nConclusion\nAs the role of simulation modeling in population health is increasing and models are becoming more complex, there is a need for further improvements in model validation methodology and common standards for evaluating model credibility.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3001435","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BioMed Central","authors":[{"firstname":"Jacek

in their homes to prevent the spread of the virus.\n The lockdown had serious implications on mental health, resulting in psychological problems including frustration, stress, and depression.\n In order to explore the impacts of this pandemic on the lives of students, we conducted a survey of a total of 1182 individuals of different age groups from various educational institutes in Delhi - National Capital Region (NCR), India.\n The article identified the following as the impact of COVID-19 on the students of different age groups: time spent on online classes and self-study, medium used for learning, sleeping habits, daily fitness routine, and the subsequent effects on weight, social life, and mental health.\n Moreover, our research found that in order to deal with stress and anxiety, participants adopted different coping mechanisms and also sought help from their near ones.\n Further, the research examined the student’s engagement on social media platforms among different age categories.\n This study suggests that public authorities should take all the necessary measures to enhance the learning experience by mitigating the negative impacts caused due to the COVID-19 outbreak.\n","id":"PMC7762625","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

findings, and epidemiological features of the first series of cases, and a cluster, confirmed in Bolivia.\n\n\nMethods\nFor this observational, retrospective and cross-sectional study, information was obtained from the Hospitals and the Ministry of Health for the cases that were laboratory-diagnosed and related, during March 2020. rRT-PCR was used for the detection of the RNA of SARS-CoV-2 following the protocol Charité, Berlin, Germany, from nasopharyngeal swabs.\n\n\nResults\nAmong 152 suspected cases investigated, 12 (7.9%) were confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infected by rRT-PCR.\n\n The median age was 39 years (IQR 25–43), six of them male.\n\n Two cases proceed from Italy and three from Spain.\n\n Nine patients presented fever, and cough, five sore throat, and myalgia, among other symptoms.\n\n Only a 60 y-old woman with hypertension was hospitalized.\n\n None of the patients required ICU nor fatalities occurred in this group.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis is the first report of

of Saudi Arabia (KSA) hosted the largest annual mass gathering of over 3 million pilgrims from 180 plus countries.\n However, the events surrounding the latest threat to global health, the PHEIC COVID-19, may be sufficient to highlight the role of mass gatherings, mass migration, and other forms of dense gatherings of people on the emergence, sustenance, and transmission of novel pathogens.\n The COVID-19 spread illustrates the role of MGs in exacerbation of the scope of pandemics.\n Cancellation or suspension of MGs would be critical to pandemic mitigation.\n It is unlikely that medical countermeasures are available during the early phase of pandemics.\n Therefore, mitigation of its impact, rather than containment and control becomes a priority during pandemics.\n As the most systematically studied MG-related respiratory disease data come from KSA, the cancellation of Umrah by the KSA authorities, prior to emergence of cases, provide the best opportunity to develop mathematical models to quantify event cancellations related mitigation of COVID-19 transmission in KSA and to the home countries of pilgrims.\n COVID-19 has already provided examples of both clearly planned event cancellations such as the Umrah suspension in KSA, and where outbreaks and events were continued.\n","id":"PMC7102534","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier

responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic has uncovered the age-associated vulnerability in the burden of disease and put aging research in the spotlight.\n The limited data available indicates that COVID-19 should be referred to as a gerolavic (from Greek, géros “old man” and epilavís, “harmful”) infection because the infection rates, severity, and lethality are substantially higher in the population aged 60 and older.\n This is primarily due to comorbidity but may be partially due to immunosenescence, decreased immune function in the elderly, and general loss of function, fitness, and increased frailty associated with aging.\n Immunosenescence is a major factor affecting vaccination response, as well as the severity and lethality of infectious diseases.\n While vaccination reduces infection rates, and therapeutic interventions reduce the severity and lethality of infections, these interventions have limitations.\n Previous studies showed that postulated geroprotectors, such as sirolimus (rapamycin) and its close derivative rapalog everolimus (RAD001), decreased infection rates in a small sample of elderly patients.\n This article presents a review of the limited literature available on geroprotective and senoremediative interventions that may be investigated to decrease the disease burden of gerolavic infections.\n This article also highlights a need for rigorous clinical validation of deep aging clocks as surrogate markers of biological age.\n These could be used to assess the need for, and efficacy of, geroprotective and senoremediative interventions and provide better protection for elderly populations from gerolavic infections.\n This article does not represent medical advice and the medications described are not yet licensed or recommended as immune system boosters, as they have not undergone clinical evaluation for this purpose.\n","id":"PMC7202545","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Impact

testing in the management of women with equivocal cervical cytological abnormalities, but not in case of low-grade lesions.\n We performed a meta-analysis including studies where the high-risk probe of the Hybrid Capture-II is used to triage these two cytological categories.\n The triage test-positivity rate reflects the colposcopy referral workload.\nData were pooled on the HPV test positivity rate in women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS/ASC-US) or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL), derived from different cytological classification systems.\n The meta-analysis was restricted to studies, published between 1991 and 2007. A random-effect model was applied for meta-analytical pooling and the influence of covariates on the HPV positivity rate was analyzed by meta-regression.\n The variation by age was assessed within individual studies since age strata were not defined uniformly.\n On an average, 43% (95% CI: 40–46%) of women with ASCUS/ASC-US were high-risk HPV positive (range 23–74%).\n In women with LSIL, the pooled positivity rate was 76% (95% CI: 71–81%; range 55–89%).\n In spite of considerable inter-study heterogeneity, the difference in HPV positivity between the two triage groups was large and highly significant: 32% (95% CI: 27–38%).\n HPV rates dropped tremendously as age and cutoffs of test positivity increased.\n Other factors (cytological classification system, country, continent, collection method and year of publication) had no statistically significant impact, except in LSIL triage where HPV positivity was significantly lower in European compared to American studies.\n Women with LSIL, especially younger women, have high HPV positivity rates suggesting limited utility of reflex HPV triaging these cases.\n Research is needed to identify more specific methods to triage women with low-grade squamous cervical lesions.\n","id":"PMC3822872","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","authors":[{"firstname":"Marc","surname":"Arbyn","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pierre","surname":"Martin-Hirsch","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Frank","surname":"Buntinx","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Marc","surname":"Van Ranst","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Evangelos","surname":"Paraskevaidis","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Joakim","surname":"Dillner","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1111/1471-0528.12655","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Meta-analysis of the efficacy of cold coagulation as a treatment method for cervical intra-epithelial neoplasis: a systematic review","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.vaccine.2012.06.095","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Evidence regarding human papillomavirus testing in secondary prevention of cervical cancer","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Human papillomavirus testing versus repeat cytology for triage of minor cytological cervical lesions","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Global call to action for inclusion of migrants and refugees in the COVID-19 response","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Lancet Migration: global collaboration to advance migration health","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Leaving no one behind in the COVID-19 pandemic: a call for urgent global action to include migrants and refugees in the COVID-19 response","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"EU migration policies drive health crisis on Greek islands","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The UCL-Lancet Commission on Migration and Health: the health of a world on the move","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1038/s41591-020-0851-2","date":"1970-01-01","title":"COVID-19 in humanitarian settings and lessons learned from past epidemics","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Pernitez-Agan S., Bautista M.A., Lopez J. et al.

The practice of mass quarantine made the negative consequences of exclusionary othering for public health particularly noticeable.\n In the light of recent data indicating this measure to be epidemiologically, legally and ethically insufficient, we apply the concept of othering to public health and discuss (1) exclusionary, (2) inclusionary and (3) diversity-sensitive approaches to public health.\n We finally conclude that a shift of perspective from exclusion to inclusion, from subordination to empowerment and from silencing to participation is urgently required.\n","id":"PMC7780422","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"BMJ Publishing Group","authors":[{"firstname":"Marie","surname":"Tallarek","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kayvan","surname":"Bozorgmehr","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Kayvan","surname":"Bozorgmehr","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jacob","surname":"Spallek","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30758-3","date":"1970-01-01","title":"COVID-19 will not leave behind refugees and migrants","abstract":"","id":"PMC7269714","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Elsevier Ltd.","authors":[{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"The Lancet","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Situational brief: COVID-19 &amp; Migration in Germany","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"SARS-CoV-2 in Aufnahmeeinrichtungen und Gemeinschaftsunterkunften fur Gefluchtete: Epidemiologische und normativ-rechtliche Aspekte","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Covid-19 in Fluchtlingsunterkunften: OGD jetzt weiter starken","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1097/00012272-200006000-00003","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Othering: toward an understanding of difference","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1207/S15327027HC1602_7","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Othering and being othered in the context of health care services","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The dynamics of othering in activism as part of Germany's post-2015 &quot;Willkommenskultur&quot;","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.socscimed.2005.08.061","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Our health and theirs: forced migration, othering, and public health","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1080/1369183X.2017.1348224","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Refugees, migrants, neither, both: categorical fetishism and the politics of bounding in Europe's 'migration crisis'","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"German federal office for migration and refugees.

of Restricting Access to Health Care on Health Expenditures among Asylum-Seekers and Refugees: A Quasi-Experimental Study in Germany, 1994–2013","abstract":"Background\nAccess to health care for asylum-seekers and refugees (AS&amp;R) in Germany is initially restricted before regular access is granted, allegedly leading to delayed care and increasing costs of care.\n\n We analyse the effects of (a) restricted access; and (b) two major policy reforms (1997, 2007) on incident health expenditures for AS&amp;R in 1994-2013.\nMethods and Findings\nWe used annual, nation-wide, aggregate data of the German Federal Statistics Office (1994-2013) to compare incident health expenditures among AS&amp;R with restricted access (exposed) to AS&amp;R with regular access (unexposed).\n\n We calculated incidence rate differences (?IRt) and rate ratios (IRRt), as well as attributable fractions among the exposed (AFe) and the total population (AFp).\n\n The effects of between-group differences in need, and of policy reforms, on differences in per capita expenditures were assessed in (segmented) linear regression models.\n\n The exposed and unexposed groups comprised 4.16 and 1.53 million person-years.\n\n Per capita expenditures (1994–2013) were higher in the group with restricted access in absolute (?IRt = 375.80 Euros [375.77; 375.89]) and relative terms (IRR = 1.39).\n\n The AFe was 28.07% and the AFp 22.21%.\n\n Between-group differences in mean age and in the type of accommodation were the main independent predictors of between-group expenditure differences.\n\n Need variables explained 50-75% of the variation in between-group differences over time.\n\n The 1997 policy reform significantly increased ?IRt adjusted for secular trends and between-group differences in age (by 600.0 Euros [212.6; 986.2]) and sex (by 867.0 Euros [390.9; 1342.5]).\n\n The 2007 policy reform had no such effect.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe cost of excluding AS&amp;R from health care appears ultimately higher than granting regular access to care.\n\n Excess expenditures attributable to the restriction were substantial and could not be completely explained by differences in need.\n\n An evidence-informed discourse on access to health care for AS&amp;R in Germany is needed; it urgently requires high-quality, individual-level data.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4511805","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"Public Library of

coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing Municipal Science and Technology

Ideally, matters related to inadequate housing of vulnerable migrant workers need to be addressed before a pandemic.\nKey messages\nWhat is already known about this subject?\nMillions of low-skilled migrant workers live in housing conditions where social distancing is difficult to practise, with poor hygiene. During a pandemic, these housing sites could be flash points for spread of infection among these workers.\nWhat are the new findings?\nFrom early April 2020, a marked escalation of new cases of COVID-19 was observed among low-skilled migrant workers living in dormitories in Singapore. By 6 May 2020, these infected workers formed 87.9% of the 20 198 cases of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Singapore.\nHow might this impact on policy or clinical practice in the foreseeable future?\nUnsatisfactory housing and social overcrowding in accommodation for low-skilled migrant workers need to be addressed before any pandemic occurs. If this is not done, epicentres of the disease can arise in these housing areas. Once they occur, management of these localised outbreaks have to be swift and comprehensive, in order to avoid spillover infections to the general population.\nIntroduction\nThe International Labour Organization (ILO) estimates that there are 244 million migrants around the world. A significant number of these migrants are low or semiskilled workers, who live under conditions that pose concerns of social overcrowding and unsatisfactory hygiene. While their housing conditions have generally improved over the years, the conditions are not ideal for a pandemic situation. COVID-19 has highlighted the vulnerability of migrant workers as an occupational group.\nSingapore is an island city-state of 721 square kilometres and a population of 5.7 million residents. It has over a million migrant workers, among which several hundred thousand low-skilled migrant workers live in dormitories. Approximately 200 thousand workers are housed in 43 large purpose-built dormitories of over a thousand residents. The larger dormitories can house 3000 to 25 000 workers and are designed for communal living, with common recreational facilities, mini grocery stores and remittance services, and are managed by operators regulated by the Ministry of Manpower. The residents are mainly males from South Asia employed in the construction, marine and other low wage sectors. In addition, there are about 1200 factory-converted dormitories (which can accommodate 50-500 workers) that house another 95 000 workers. Another 20 000 workers live in construction temporary quarters at their worksites, usually with &lt;40 persons per site. \nMethods\nThe number of daily new cases of COVID-19 in March, April and early May 2020 in Singapore; the cause of a surge of cases in April 2020; the national response to the huge increase in cases; and regulations on migrant worker accommodation were examined.\nInformation was gathered from daily reports provided by the Ministry of Health, Singapore. These reports provided information on the number of newly diagnosed cases, and the distribution of the cases among imported cases who arrived to Singapore from overseas, and non-imported cases. The non-imported cases are categorised into Community Cases (residents and employment pass holders excluding work permit holders and dormitory residents), work permit holders not residing in dormitories and work permit holders residing in dormitories.\nMigrant workers in Singapore can either hold an Employment Pass or a Work Permit. Skilled workers earning more than SGD3600 per month hold employment passes, while Work Permit holders are semiskilled workers working in the construction, manufacturing, marine shipyard, process or services sector. \nThe principal legislation relating to the housing of migrant workers in dormitories was examined from the Singapore Statues online website. Additional information was gathered from a Ministerial statement given in a Singapore Parliament sitting on 4 May 2020. \nResults\nIn Singapore, cases of COVID-19 are confirmed by a positive finding of a nasal swab which undergoes PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2. The total number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 increased from 105 on 1st March, to 226 on 15th March, 926 on 31st March, 3699 on 15th April, 16 169 on 30th April 2020 and 20 198 on 6th May 2020 (figure 1). \nNumber of new cases of confirmed COVID-19 in Singapore, 1 March-5 May 2020 [Source: Ministry of Health].\nThe small rise in cases in March was mainly due to 'imported' cases of citizens and long-term residents who returned from other infected countries. They were quarantined or given Stay at Home notices for 14 days on their return to Singapore since mid-March (depending on which country they returned from), and were monitored daily for fever and symptoms of COVID-19. From 15 to 31 March, 714 new cases of COVID-19 were confirmed in Singapore, of whom 439 (61%) were imported cases.\nA surge of cases seen from early April was caused by a large number of locally transmitted infections. The majority of the new cases occurred among low-skilled migrant workers living in dormitories scattered throughout Singapore. As of 6 May 2020, there were 17 758 confirmed COVID-19 cases among those living in migrant worker dormitories (88% of 20 198 nationally confirmed cases). A single dormitory housing approximately 13 000 workers had 2526 confirmed cases, accounting for 12.5% of all cases in the country. Twenty-four dormitories have been declared as isolation areas, with residents quarantined for 14 days. \nThe national response\nThe national response was swift and comprehensive. A multi-agency task force including health, manpower, military and police personnel was immediately formed. Among the sweeping measures implemented were extensive testing of dormitory workers, segregation of healthy and infected workers, observation for fever and symptoms several times a day, and setting up of dormitory on-site healthcare facilities.\nThe local community also helped in the response. Within days, websites that offered English to Bengali (tinyurl.com/covidbengali) and English to Tamil translations (http://better.sg/migrantworkertranslations) to medical care teams were developed. This helped overcome the language barrier and allowed non-Bengali and non-Tamil-speaking healthcare workers to conduct an initial consultation without an interpreter. The websites also enabled medical personnel to contact a group of volunteer interpreters directly. About 3000 healthcare professionals signed up to the SG Healthcare Corps since its launch in April to marshal volunteers. Many were deployed to assist in the management of the dormitory infections.\nMassive logistic arrangements have been made to provide housing facilities that will allow for appropriate social distancing. These included vacant public housing flats, military camps, exhibition centres and even floating hotels. Preparations were put in place for food delivery, hygiene maintenance, monitoring and enforcement of quarantine, WiFi for workers to communicate with family and for entertainment and distribution of 'care packs' that contained reusable masks, hand sanitisers and thermometers.\nDiscussion\nInternational recommendations for housing standards for workers have been produced by the ILO. In Singapore, dormitories housing over a thousand residents are regulated by the Foreign Employee Dormitories Act 2015. The Act provides a regulatory framework for provision of facilities and amenities, and delivery of services to residents of foreign employee dormitories. It specifies accommodation standards and mechanisms for enforcement of these standards and to promote sustainability and continuous improvements in the dormitories. A Commissioner for Foreign Employee Dormitories is responsible to administer the Act, with possible penalties imposed on dormitory operators ranging from fines of up to SGD50 000 and jail terms of up to 12 months. In 2019, 100 full-time inspectors conducted approximately 1200 inspections and 3000 investigations. Every year about 20 dormitory operators are found to breach the Act. \nIn spite of these existing regulations and enforcement, conditions in the dormitories still allowed the COVID-19 outbreak to emerge. This is likely due to the difficulty to practise adequate social distancing, mingling of residents in common areas and shared facilities, for example, recreational, cooking, dining areas and toilets.\nMany of the infected dormitory residents had mild symptoms, and some were even asymptomatic. These patients would not require hospitalisation and were isolated at community care facilities. As the patients are primarily young and free from significant comorbidities, their risk of serious complications and death is lower compared with the general population which has older persons at higher risk of complications and death from COVID-19. As of 6 May 2020, there has not been any deaths resulting from COVID-19 among the 17 758 infected workers. On 6 May 2020, none of these workers were hospitalised in intensive care. However, the impact on mental health among the workers should not be overlooked and needs to be addressed.\nThe number of cases will likely increase. Among the 3711 passengers and crew living in close proximity aboard the cruise ship Diamond Princess, 712 persons (19.2%) were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, even after quarantine and preventive measures were implemented. In one dormitory of about 13 000 workers in Singapore, 1123 residents (8.6%) were infected as of 17 April 2020, and by 6 May, this number increased to 2526 confirmed cases (19.4% infected residents).\nBesides COVID-19, migrant workers in Singapore are at higher risk than local residents for specific infectious diseases. From 1990-2011, enteric fevers and tuberculosis cases have increased in Singapore, which could possibly be due to greater influx of migrant workers. Migrant workers accounted for half of diagnosed cases of hepatitis E, and construction workers were reported to be at higher risk of arboviral infections such as dengue, Zika and chikungunya. \nOther settings that would also face similar issues would include migrant and refugee camps, custodial facilities and nursing homes, which could also give rise to potential clusters of infected cases. These facilities will also pose infection risks to employees in these locations.\nIdeally, matters related to inadequate housing of vulnerable migrant workers (and other similarly affected populations) need to be addressed before a pandemic. As this is unfortunately not the norm, these issues should not be disregarded but need to be urgently and conscientiously managed and resolved during a pandemic. Otherwise, these sites can be potential epicentres for COVID-19, which could subsequently lead to more widespread local transmission in the general community.\nFunding: The authors have not declared a
