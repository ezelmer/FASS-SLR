{"SLR NAME":"Effective public health measures to mitigate the spread of COVID 19: a systematic review","SlR References":[{"doi":"10.2196/24598","date":"2020-12-08","title":"The Use of Digital Tools to Mitigate the COVID-19 Pandemic: Comparative Retrospective Study of Six Countries","abstract":"Background\nSince the COVID-19 outbreak began in Wuhan, China, countries worldwide have been forced to take unprecedented measures to combat it.\n\n While some countries are still grappling with the COVID-19 pandemic, others have fared better and have re-established relative normalcy quickly.\n\n The rapid transmission rate of the virus has shown a greater need for efficient and technologically modern containment measures.\n\n The use of digital tools to facilitate strict containment measures in countries that have fared well against the COVID-19 pandemic has sparked both interest and controversy.\n\n\nObjective\nIn this study, we compare the precautions taken against the spread of COVID-19 in the United States, Spain, and Italy, with Taiwan, South Korea, and Singapore, particularly related to the use of digital tools for contact tracing, and propose policies that could be used in the United States for future COVID-19 waves or pandemics.\n\n\nMethods\nCOVID-19 death rate data were obtained from the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), accessed through the Our World in Data database, and were evaluated based on population size per 100,000 people from December 31, 2019, to September 6, 2020. All policies and measures enacted were obtained from their respective governmental websites.\n\n\nResults\nWe found a strong association between lower death rates per capita and countries that implemented early mask use and strict border control measures that included mandatory quarantine using digital tools.\n\n There is a significant difference in the number of deaths per 100,000 when comparing Taiwan, South Korea, and Singapore with the United States, Spain, and Italy.\n\n\nConclusions\nBased on our research, it is evident that early intervention with the use of digital tools had a strong correlation with the successful containment of COVID-19. Infection rates and subsequent deaths in Italy, Spain, and the United States could have been much lower with early mask use and, more importantly, timely border control measures using modern digital tools.\n\n Thus, we propose that the United States execute the following national policies should a public health emergency be declared: (1) immediately establish a National Command responsible for enacting strict mandatory guidelines enforced by federal and state governments, including national mask use; (2) mandate civilian cooperation with health officials in contact tracing and quarantine orders; and (3) require incoming travelers to the United States and those quarantined to download a contact tracing app.\n\n We acknowledge the countries we studied differ in their cultures, political systems, and reporting criteria for COVID-19 deaths.\n\n Further research may need to be conducted to address these limitations; however, we believe that the proposed policies could protect the American public.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7759507","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Gunther","surname":"Eysenbach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"

the Increase in Daily New Cases of COVID-19 in 54 Countries and 4 Epicenters of the Pandemic: Comparative Observational Study","abstract":"Background\nCoronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a worldwide epidemic, and various countries have responded with different containment measures to reduce disease transmission, including stay-at-home orders, curfews, and lockdowns.\n\n Comparative studies have not yet been conducted to investigate the impact of these containment measures; these studies are needed to facilitate public health policy-making across countries.\n\n\nObjective\nThe aim of this study was to describe and evaluate the impact of national containment measures and policies (stay-at-home orders, curfews, and lockdowns) on decelerating the increase in daily new cases of COVID-19 in 54 countries and 4 epicenters of the pandemic in different jurisdictions worldwide.\n\n\nMethods\nWe reviewed the effective dates of the national containment measures (stay-at-home order, curfew, or lockdown) of 54 countries and 4 epicenters of the COVID-19 pandemic (Wuhan, New York State, Lombardy, and Madrid), and we searched cumulative numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases and daily new cases provided by health authorities.\n\n Data were drawn from an open, crowdsourced, daily-updated COVID-19 data set provided by Our World in Data.\n\n We examined the trends in the percent increase in daily new cases from 7 days before to 30 days after the dates on which containment measures went into effect by continent, World Bank income classification, type of containment measures, effective date of containment measures, and number of confirmed cases on the effective date of the containment measures.\n\n\nResults\nWe included 122,366 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection from 54 countries and 24,071 patients from 4 epicenters on the effective dates on which stay-at-home orders, curfews, or lockdowns were implemented between January 23 and April 11, 2020. Stay-at-home, curfew, and lockdown measures commonly commenced in countries with approximately 30%, 20%, or 10% increases in daily new cases.\n\n All three measures were found to lower the percent increase in daily new cases to &lt;5 within one month.\n\n Among the countries studied, 20% had an average percent increase in daily new cases of 30-49 over the seven days prior to the commencement of containment measures; the percent increase in daily new cases in these countries was curbed to 10 and 5 a maximum of 15 days and 23 days after the implementation of containment measures, respectively.\n\n\nConclusions\nDifferent national containment measures were associated with a decrease in daily new cases of confirmed COVID-19 infection.\n\n Stay-at-home orders, curfews, and lockdowns curbed the percent increase in daily new cases to &lt;5 within a month.\n\n Resurgence in cases within one month was observed in some South American countries.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7377680","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Gunther","surname":"Eysenbach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Guy","surname":"Fagherazzi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Juan","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Juan","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Claire","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Céline","surname":"Mavrot","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Carlos K H","surname":"Wong","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Carlos K H","surname":"Wong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Janet Y H","surname":"Wong","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Janet Y H","surname":"Wong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Eric H M","surname":"Tang","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Eric H M","surname":"Tang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Chi Ho","surname":"Au","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Chi Ho","surname":"Au","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Kristy T K","surname":"Lau","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":" Kristy T K","surname":"Lau","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Abraham K C","surname":"Wai","email":"awai@hku.hk","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"                           Abraham K C","surname":"Wai","email":"awai@hku.hk","contributions":"0"}],"References depth 1":[{"doi":"10.1016/j.idc.2019.08.001","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)","abstract":"The Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a novel lethal zoonotic disease of humans caused by the MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV).\n Although MERS is endemic to the Middle East, travelers have exported MERS-CoV on return to their home countries.\n Clinical manifestations range from mild to severe acute respiratory disease and death.\n The elderly, immunocompromised, and those with chronic comorbid liver, lung, and hepatic conditions have a high mortality rate.\n There is no specific treatment.\n Person-to-person spread causes hospital and household outbreaks, and thus improved compliance with internationally recommended infection control protocols and rapid implementation of infection control measures are required.\n","id":"PMC7127753","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Esam I.","surname":"Azhar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"David S.C.","surname":"Hui","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ziad A.","surname":"Memish","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christian","surname":"Drosten","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Alimuddin","surname":"Zumla","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References depth 2":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.idc.2019.07.001","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","abstract":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), emerged from China and rapidly spread worldwide.\n Over 8098 people fell ill and 774 died before the epidemic ended in July 2003.

Comparisons between the viruses were made.\n\n\nResults\nInadequate risk assessment regarding the urgency of the situation, and limited reporting on the virus within China has, in part, led to the rapid spread of COVID-19 throughout mainland China and into proximal and distant countries.\n\n Compared with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has spread more rapidly, due in part to increased globalization and the focus of the epidemic.\n\n Wuhan, China is a large hub connecting the North, South, East and West of China via railways and a major international airport.\n\n The availability of connecting flights, the timing of the outbreak during the Chinese (Lunar) New Year, and the massive rail transit hub located in Wuhan has enabled the virus to perforate throughout China, and eventually, globally.\n\n\nConclusions\nWe conclude that we did not learn from the two prior epidemics of coronavirus and were ill-prepared to deal with the challenges the COVID-19 epidemic has posed.\n\n Future research should attempt to address the uses and implications of internet of things (IoT) technologies for mapping the spread of infection.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7197734","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Noah

viral RNAs escape recognition by the host innate immune system.\n The RNA genomes of coronavirus were identified to have 5?-caps in the early 1980s.\n However, for decades the RNA capping mechanisms

of China.\n Within a few weeks, a novel coronavirus tentatively named as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was announced by the World Health Organization.\n We performed bioinformatics analysis on a virus genome from a patient with 2019-nCoV infection and compared it with other related coronavirus genomes.\n Overall, the genome of 2019-nCoV has 89% nucleotide identity with bat SARS-like-CoVZXC21 and 82% with that of human SARS-CoV.\n The phylogenetic trees of their orf1a/b, Spike, Envelope, Membrane and Nucleoprotein also clustered closely with those of the bat, civet and human SARS coronaviruses.\n However, the external subdomain of Spikes receptor binding domain of 2019-nCoV shares only 40% amino acid identity with other SARS-related coronaviruses.\n Remarkably, its orf3b encodes a completely novel short protein.\n Furthermore, its new orf8 likely encodes a secreted protein with an alpha-helix, following with a beta-sheet(s) containing six strands.\n Learning from the roles of civet in SARS and camel in MERS, hunting for the animal source of 2019-nCoV and its more ancestral virus would be important for understanding the origin and evolution of this novel lineage B betacoronavirus.\n These findings provide the basis for starting further studies on the pathogenesis, and optimizing the design of diagnostic, antiviral and vaccination strategies for this emerging

novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension

epidemiological studies of SARS comparing epidemiologic features across regions.\n\n The aim of this study is to identify similarities and differences in SARS epidemiology in three populations with similar host and viral genotype.\n\n\nMethods\nWe present a comparative epidemiologic analysis of SARS, based on an integrated dataset with 3,336 SARS patients from Hong Kong, Beijing and Taiwan, epidemiological and clinical characteristics such as incubation, onset-to-admission, onset-to-discharge and onset-to-death periods, case fatality ratios (CFRs) and presenting symptoms are described and compared between regions.\n\n We further explored the influence of demographic and clinical variables on the apparently large differences in CFRs between the three regions.\n\n\nResults\nAll three regions showed similar incubation periods and progressive shortening of the onset-to-admission interval through the epidemic.\n\n Adjusted for sex, health care worker status and nosocomial setting, older age was associated with a higher fatality, with adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 2.10 (95% confidence interval: 1.45, 3.04) for those aged 51-60; AOR: 4.57 (95% confidence interval: 3.32, 7.30) for those aged above 60 compared to those aged 41-50 years.\n\n Presence of pre-existing comorbid conditions was also associated with greater mortality (AOR: 1.74; 95% confidence interval: 1.36, 2.21).\n\n\nConclusion\nThe large discrepancy in crude fatality ratios across the three regions can only be partly explained by epidemiological and clinical heterogeneities.\n\n Our findings underline the importance of a common data collection platform, especially in an emerging epidemic, in order to identify and explain consistencies and differences in the eventual clinical and public health outcomes of infectious disease outbreaks, which is becoming increasingly important in our highly interconnected

by interspecies transmission.\n Considering the diversity of bat coronaviruses, bat species and populations, we expect to discover more bat CoVs through virus surveillance.\n In this study, we described a new member of alphaCoV (BtCoV/Rh/YN2012) in bats with unique genome features.\n Unique accessory genes, ORF4a and ORF4b were found between the spike gene and the envelope gene, while ORF8 gene was found downstream of the nucleocapsid gene.\n All the putative genes were further confirmed by reverse-transcription analyses.\n One unique gene at the 3 end of the BtCoV/Rh/YN2012 genome, ORF9, exhibits ~30% amino acid identity to ORF7a of the SARS-related coronavirus.\n Functional analysis showed ORF4a protein can activate IFN-? production, whereas ORF3a can regulate NF-?B production.\n We also screened the spike-mediated virus entry using the spike-pseudotyped retroviruses system, although failed to find any fully permissive cells.\n Our results expand the knowledge on

2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and Prevention of Infectious Disease in China, Chinese Academy of

potent signal 2 required for activation.\n Mechanistically, ORF8b interacts directly with the Leucine Rich Repeat domain of NLRP3 and localizes with NLRP3 and ASC in cytosolic dot-like structures.\n

Cases exported domestically were then estimated.\n\n We forecasted the national and global spread of 2019-nCoV, accounting for the effect of the metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan and surrounding cities, which began Jan 2324, 2020. We used data on monthly flight bookings from the Official Aviation Guide and data on human mobility across more than 300 prefecture-level cities in mainland China from the Tencent database.\n\n Data on confirmed cases were obtained from the reports published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n Serial interval estimates were based on previous studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV).\n\n A susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered metapopulation model was used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China.\n\n The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credibile interval (CrI).\n\n\nFindings\nIn our baseline scenario, we estimated that the basic reproductive number for 2019-nCoV was 2·68 (95% CrI 2·472·86) and that 75?815 individuals (95% CrI 37?304130?330) have been infected in Wuhan as of Jan 25, 2020. The epidemic doubling time was 6·4 days (95% CrI 5·87·1).\n\n We estimated that in the baseline scenario, Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen had imported 461 (95% CrI 227805), 113 (57193), 98 (49168), 111 (56191), and 80 (40139) infections from Wuhan, respectively.\n\n If the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV were similar everywhere domestically and over time, we inferred that epidemics are already growing exponentially in multiple major cities of China with a lag time behind the Wuhan outbreak of about 12 weeks.\n\n\nInterpretation\nGiven that 2019-nCoV is no longer contained within Wuhan, other major Chinese cities are probably sustaining localised outbreaks.\n\n Large cities overseas with close transport links to China could also become outbreak epicentres, unless substantial public health interventions at both the population and personal levels are implemented immediately.\n\n Independent self-sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally could become inevitable because of substantial exportation of presymptomatic cases and in the absence of large-scale public health interventions.\n\n Preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be readied for quick deployment globally.\n\n\nFunding\nHealth and Medical Research Fund (Hong Kong,

Serological Study for the Prevalence of Anti-MERS Coronavirus Antibodies in High- and Low-Risk Groups in Qatar","abstract":"Infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) could be asymptomatic or cause mild influenza-like illness.\n Therefore, the prevalence of MERS-CoV infections in the general population could be underestimated, which necessitates active surveillance to determine the epidemiological importance of asymptomatic cases.\n The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of various serological assays and to estimate the seroprevalence of anti-MERS-CoV antibodies in high- and low-risk groups in Qatar.\n A total of 4858 samples were screened, including 4719 samples collected from healthy blood donors (BD) over a period of five years (2012-2016), 135 samples from baseline case contacts (CC) collected from individuals in close contact with three positive PCR-confirmed patients (CP), and four samples from MERS-CoV CP.\n Initial screening using anti-MERS-CoV IgG (IgG rS1-ELISA kit) revealed ten reactive samples from BD (10/4719, 0.21%), one from CC (1/135, 0.74%), and three from CP (3/4, 75%).\n Samples from CP but not from BD were also reactive by whole-virus anti-MERS-CoV IgG (n = 3/4) and IgM (n = 1/4) indirect immunefluorescent tests (IIFT) and pseudoparticle neutralization test (ppNT).\n The reactive sample from CC was also confirmed by ppNT.\n Surprisingly, one out of thirteen (7.7%) randomly selected IgG rS1-ELISA-negative BD samples from the initial screening was reactive by the IgM-IIFT (but not by the IgG-IIFT) and was subsequently confirmed by ppNT.\n All IgG rS1-ELISA-reactive samples from BD exhibited considerable reactivity to the four circulating human coronaviruses (HKU1, OC43, 229E, and NL63).\n Cross-reactivity with SARS was only reported for samples from CP using IgG and IgM-IIFT.\n In conclusion, we report a low prevalence of anti-MERS antibodies in the general population, which coincides with the low number of all reported cases by the time of our study (2017) in Qatar (n = 21).\n The false-positive results and the observed cross-reactivity between MERS-CoV and other circulating human coronavirus necessitate more detailed evaluation of available serological assays.\n","id":"PMC6398027","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Reham

We used the date of the fourth revision of the case definition (Jan 27) to divide the epidemic into two time periods (Dec 24 to Jan 27, and Jan 28 to Feb 17) as the date of symptom onset.\n\n We estimated trends in the demographic characteristics of cases and key time-to-event intervals.\n\n We used a Bayesian approach to estimate the dynamics of the net reproduction number (Rt) at the provincial level.\n\n\nFindings\nWe collected data on 8579 cases from 30 provinces.\n\n The median age of cases was 44 years (3356), with an increasing proportion of cases in younger age groups and in elderly people (ie, aged &gt;64 years) as the epidemic progressed.\n\n The mean time from symptom onset to hospital admission decreased from 4·4 days (95% CI 0·014·0) for the period of Dec 24 to Jan 27, to 2·6 days (0·09·0) for the period of Jan 28 to Feb 17. The mean incubation period for the entire period was estimated at 5·2 days (1·812·4) and the mean serial interval at 5·1 days (1·311·6).\n\n The epidemic dynamics in provinces outside Hubei were highly variable but consistently included a mixture of case importations and local transmission.\n\n We estimated that the epidemic was self-sustained for less than 3 weeks, with mean Rt reaching peaks between 1·08 (95% CI 0·741·54) in Shenzhen city of Guangdong province and 1·71 (1·322·17) in Shandong province.\n\n In all the locations for which we had sufficient data coverage of Rt, Rt was estimated to be below the epidemic threshold (ie, &lt;1) after Jan 30.\nInterpretation\nOur estimates of the incubation period and serial interval were similar, suggesting an early peak of infectiousness, with possible transmission before the onset of symptoms.\n\n Our results also indicate that, as the epidemic progressed, infectious individuals were isolated more quickly, thus shortening the window of transmission in the community.\n\n Overall, our findings indicate that strict containment measures, movement restrictions, and increased awareness of the population might have contributed to interrupt local transmission of SARS-CoV-2 outside Hubei province.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars, National Institute of General Medical Sciences, and European Commission Horizon 2020.\n","id":"PMC7269887","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Juanjuan","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Maria","surname":"Litvinova","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yan","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaowei","surname":"Deng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xinghui","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mei","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wen","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lan","surname":"Yi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xinhua","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qianhui","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yuxia","surname":"Liang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiling","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Juan","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kaiyuan","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ira M","surname":"Longini","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"M Elizabeth","surname":"Halloran","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Benjamin J","surname":"Cowling","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Stefano","surname":"Merler","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Cecile","surname":"Viboud","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alessandro","surname":"Vespignani","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Marco","surname":"Ajelli","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hongjie","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Epidemic update and risk assessment of 2019 novel coronavirus 2020","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Update on COVID-19 as of 24:00 on March 10, 2020","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) situation report-47","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Statement on the second meeting of the International Health Regulations (2005) Emergency Committee regarding the outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2001316","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Early Transmission Dynamics in Wuhan, China, of Novel CoronavirusInfected Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nThe initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020.

Understanding the early transmission dynamics of the infection and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures is crucial for assessing the potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas.\n\n Combining a mathematical model of severe SARS-CoV-2 transmission with four datasets from within and outside Wuhan, we estimated how transmission in Wuhan varied between December, 2019, and February, 2020. We used these estimates to assess the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission to occur in locations outside Wuhan if cases were introduced.\n\n\nMethods\nWe combined a stochastic transmission model with data on cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan and international cases that originated in Wuhan to estimate how transmission had varied over time during January, 2020, and February, 2020. Based on these estimates, we then calculated the probability that newly introduced cases might generate outbreaks in other areas.\n\n To estimate the early dynamics of transmission in Wuhan, we fitted a stochastic transmission dynamic model to multiple publicly available datasets on cases in Wuhan and internationally exported cases from Wuhan.\n\n The four datasets we fitted to were: daily number of new internationally exported cases (or lack thereof), by date of onset, as of Jan 26, 2020; daily number of new cases in Wuhan with no market exposure, by date of onset, between Dec 1, 2019, and Jan 1, 2020; daily number of new cases in China, by date of onset, between Dec 29, 2019, and Jan 23, 2020; and proportion of infected passengers on evacuation flights between Jan 29, 2020, and Feb 4, 2020. We used an additional two datasets for comparison with model outputs: daily number of new exported cases from Wuhan (or lack thereof) in countries with high connectivity to Wuhan (ie, top 20 most at-risk countries), by date of confirmation, as of Feb 10, 2020; and data on new confirmed cases reported in Wuhan between Jan 16, 2020, and Feb 11, 2020.\nFindings\nWe estimated that the median daily reproduction number (Rt) in Wuhan declined from 2·35 (95% CI 1·154·77) 1 week before travel restrictions were introduced on Jan 23, 2020, to 1·05 (0·412·39) 1 week after.\n\n Based on our estimates of Rt, assuming SARS-like variation, we calculated that in locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan in early January, once there are at least four independently introduced cases, there is a more than 50% chance the infection will establish within that population.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur results show that COVID-19 transmission probably declined in Wuhan during late January, 2020, coinciding with the introduction of travel control measures.\n\n As more cases arrive in international locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan before these control measures, it is likely many chains of transmission will fail to establish initially, but might lead to new outbreaks eventually.\n\n\nFunding\nWellcome Trust, Health Data Research UK, Bill &amp;

For R0 values of 2·5 or 3·5, if there were 40 initial cases, contact tracing and isolation were only potentially feasible when less than 1% of transmission occurred before symptom onset.\n\n\nInterpretation\nIn most scenarios, highly effective contact tracing and case isolation is enough to control a new outbreak of COVID-19 within 3 months.\n\n The probability of control decreases with long delays from symptom onset to isolation, fewer cases ascertained by contact tracing, and increasing transmission before symptoms.\n\n This model can be modified to reflect updated transmission characteristics and more specific definitions of outbreak control to assess the potential success of local response efforts.\n\n\nFunding\nWellcome Trust, Global Challenges Research Fund, and Health Data Research UK.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7097845","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Joel","surname":"Hellewell","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sam","surname":"Abbott","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Amy","surname":"Gimma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nikos I","surname":"Bosse","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christopher I","surname":"Jarvis","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Timothy W","surname":"Russell","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"James D","surname":"Munday","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Adam J","surname":"Kucharski","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"W John","surname":"Edmunds","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Fiona","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Stefan","surname":"Flasche","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Billy J","surname":"Quilty","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nicholas","surname":"Davies","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Samuel","surname":"Clifford","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Petra","surname":"Klepac","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mark","surname":"Jit","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Charlie","surname":"Diamond","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hamish","surname":"Gibbs","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kevin","surname":"van Zandvoort","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sebastian","surname":"Funk","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sebastian","surname":"Funk","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sebastian","surname":"Funk","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rosalind M","surname":"Eggo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1101/2020.02.14.20023036","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The efficacy of contact tracing for the containment of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19)","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The epidemiological characteristics of an outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVD-19)","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The health impact of the 2014-15 Ebola outbreak","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]}]},{"doi":"10.1093/jtm/taaa020","date":"2020-02-10","title":"Isolation, quarantine, social distancing and community containment: pivotal role for old-style public health measures in the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak","abstract":"Public health measures were decisive in controlling the SARS epidemic in 2003.

disease is increasingly used to help guide public health policy.\n\n As directly transmitted infections, such as influenza and tuberculosis, require contact between individuals, knowledge about contact patterns is a necessary pre-requisite of accurate model predictions.\n\n Of particular interest is the potential impact of school closure as a means of controlling pandemic influenza (and potentially other pathogens).\n\n\nMethods\nThis paper uses a population-based prospective survey of mixing patterns in eight European countries to study the relative change in the basic reproduction number (R0 - the average number of secondary cases from a typical primary case in a fully susceptible population) on weekdays versus weekends and during regular versus holiday periods.\n\n The relative change in R0 during holiday periods and weekends gives an indication of the impact collective school closures (and prophylactic absenteeism) may have during a pandemic.\n\n\nResults\nSocial contact patterns differ substantially when comparing weekdays to the weekend and regular to holiday periods mainly due to the reduction in work and/or school contacts.\n\n For most countries the basic reproduction number decreases from the week to weekends and regular to holiday periods by about 21% and 17%, respectively.\n\n However for other countries no significant decrease was observed.\n\n\nConclusion\nWe use a large-scale social contact survey in eight different European countries to gain insights in the relative change in the basic reproduction number on weekdays versus weekends and during regular versus holiday periods.\n\n The resulting estimates indicate that school closure can have a substantial impact on the spread of a newly emerging infectious disease that is

epidemic or persist at endemic levels.\n Epidemic models that determine which interventions can successfully prevent an outbreak need to account for social structure and mixing patterns.\n Contact patterns vary across age and locations (e.\ng.\n home, work, and school), and including them as predictors in transmission dynamic models of pathogens that spread socially will improve the models realism.\n Data from population-based contact diaries in eight European countries from the POLYMOD study were projected to 144 other countries using a Bayesian hierarchical model that estimated the proclivity of age-and-location-specific contact patterns for the countries, using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation.\n Household level data from the Demographic and Health Surveys for nine lower-income countries and socio-demographic factors from several on-line databases for 152 countries were used to quantify similarity of countries to estimate contact patterns in the home, work, school and other locations for countries for which no contact data are available, accounting for demographic structure, household structure where known, and a variety of metrics including workforce participation and school enrolment.\n Contacts are highly assortative with age across all countries considered, but pronounced regional differences in the age-specific contacts at home were noticeable, with more inter-generational contacts in Asian countries than in other settings.\n Moreover, there were variations in contact patterns by location, with work-place contacts being least assortative.\n These variations led to differences in the effect of social distancing measures in an age structured epidemic model.\n Contacts have an important role in transmission dynamic models that use contact rates to characterize the spread of contact-transmissible diseases.\n This study provides estimates of mixing patterns for societies for which contact data such as POLYMOD are not yet

of the severity of coronavirus disease 2019: a model-based analysis","abstract":"Background\nIn the face of rapidly changing data, a range of case fatality ratio estimates for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been produced that differ substantially in magnitude.\n\n We aimed to provide robust estimates, accounting for censoring and ascertainment biases.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected individual-case data for patients who died from COVID-19 in Hubei, mainland China (reported by national and provincial health commissions to Feb 8, 2020), and for cases outside of mainland China (from government or ministry of health websites and media reports for 37 countries, as well as Hong Kong and Macau, until Feb 25, 2020).\n\n These individual-case data were used to estimate the time between onset of symptoms and outcome (death or discharge from hospital).\n\n We next obtained age-stratified estimates of the case fatality ratio by relating the aggregate distribution of cases to the observed cumulative deaths in China, assuming a constant attack rate by age and adjusting for demography and age-based and location-based under-ascertainment.\n\n We also estimated the case fatality ratio from individual line-list data on 1334 cases identified outside of mainland China.\n\n Using data on the prevalence of PCR-confirmed cases in international residents repatriated from China, we obtained age-stratified estimates of the infection fatality ratio.\n\n Furthermore, data on age-stratified severity in a subset of 3665 cases from China were used to estimate the proportion of infected individuals who are likely to require hospitalisation.\n\n\nFindings\nUsing data on 24 deaths that occurred in mainland China and 165 recoveries outside of China, we estimated the mean duration from onset of symptoms to death to be 17·8 days (95% credible interval [CrI] 16·919·2) and to hospital discharge to be 24·7 days (22·928·1).\n\n In all laboratory confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases from mainland China (n=70?117), we estimated a crude case fatality ratio (adjusted for censoring) of 3·67% (95% CrI 3·563·80).\n\n However, after further adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment, we obtained a best estimate of the case fatality ratio in China of 1·38% (1·231·53), with substantially higher ratios in older age groups (0·32% [0·270·38] in those aged &lt;60 years vs 6·4% [5·77·2] in those aged ?60 years), up to 13·4% (11·215·9) in those aged 80 years or older.\n\n Estimates of case fatality ratio from international cases stratified by age were consistent with those from China (parametric estimate 1·4% [0·43·5] in those aged &lt;60 years [n=360] and 4·5% [1·811·1] in those aged ?60 years [n=151]).\n\n Our estimated overall infection fatality ratio for China was 0·66% (0·391·33), with an increasing profile with age.\n\n Similarly, estimates of the proportion of infected individuals likely to be hospitalised increased with age up to a maximum of 18·4% (11·037·6) in those aged 80 years or older.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThese early estimates give an indication of the fatality ratio across the spectrum of COVID-19 disease and show a strong age gradient in risk of death.\n\n\nFunding\nUK Medical Research

frequentist and Bayesian meta-analyses and random-effects meta-regressions.\n\n We rated the certainty of evidence according to Cochrane methods and the GRADE approach.\n\n This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020177047.\nFindings\nOur search identified 172 observational studies across 16 countries and six continents, with no randomised controlled trials and 44 relevant comparative studies in health-care and non-health-care settings (n=25?697 patients).\n\n Transmission of viruses was lower with physical distancing of 1 m or more, compared with a distance of less than 1 m (n=10?736, pooled adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0·18, 95% CI 0·09 to 0·38; risk difference [RD] ?10·2%, 95% CI ?11·5 to ?7·5; moderate certainty); protection was increased as distance was lengthened (change in relative risk [RR] 2·02 per m; pinteraction=0·041; moderate certainty).\n\n Face mask use could result in a large reduction in risk of infection (n=2647; aOR 0·15, 95% CI 0·07 to 0·34, RD ?14·3%, ?15·9 to ?10·7; low certainty), with stronger associations with N95 or similar respirators compared with disposable surgical masks or similar (eg, reusable 1216-layer cotton masks; pinteraction=0·090; posterior probability &gt;95%, low certainty).\n\n Eye protection also was associated with less infection (n=3713; aOR 0·22, 95% CI 0·12 to 0·39, RD ?10·6%, 95% CI ?12·5 to ?7·7; low certainty).\n\n Unadjusted studies and subgroup and sensitivity analyses showed similar findings.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis support physical distancing of 1 m or more and provide quantitative estimates for models and contact tracing to inform policy.\n\n Optimum use of face masks, respirators, and eye protection in public and health-care settings should be informed by these findings and contextual factors.\n\n Robust randomised trials are needed to better inform the evidence for these interventions, but this systematic appraisal of currently best available evidence might inform interim guidance.\n\n\nFunding\nWorld Health Organization.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7263814","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Derek K","surname":"Chu","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Elie

risk of novel 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID?19); however, recommendations are conflicting and epidemiological data on their relative effectiveness against COVID?19 are limited.\n\n\nPurpose\nTo compare medical masks to N95 respirators in preventing laboratory?confirmed viral infection and respiratory illness including coronavirus specifically in healthcare workers.\n\n\nData Sources\nMEDLINE, Embase, and CENTRAL from January 1, 2014, to March 9, 2020. Update of published search conducted from January 1, 1990, to December 9, 2014.\nStudy Selection\nRandomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the protective effect of medical masks to N95 respirators in healthcare workers.\n\n\nData Extraction\nReviewer pair independently screened, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and the certainty of the evidence.\n\n\nData Synthesis\nFour RCTs were meta?analyzed adjusting for clustering.\n\n Compared with N95 respirators; the use of medical masks did not increase laboratory?confirmed viral (including coronaviruses) respiratory infection (OR 1.06; 95% CI 0.90?1.25; I\n2 = 0%; low certainty in the evidence) or clinical respiratory illness (OR 1.49; 95% CI: 0.98?2.28; I\n2 = 78%; very low certainty in the evidence).\n\n Only one trial evaluated coronaviruses separately and found no difference between the two groups (P = .\n\n49).\n\n\nLimitations\nIndirectness and imprecision of available evidence.\n\n\nConclusions\nLow certainty evidence suggests that medical masks and N95 respirators offer similar protection against viral respiratory infection including coronavirus in healthcare workers during nonaerosol?generating care.\n\n Preservation of N95 respirators for high?risk, aerosol?generating procedures in this pandemic should be considered when in short supply.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7298295","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jessica J.","surname":"Bartoszko","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mohammed Abdul Malik","surname":"Farooqi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Waleed","surname":"Alhazzani","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mark","surname":"Loeb","email":"loebm@mcmaster.ca","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Reviews: rapid!

Disease 2019?","abstract":"Cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported in more than 200 countries.\n Thousands of health workers have been infected, and outbreaks have occurred in hospitals, aged care facilities, and prisons.\n The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued guidelines for contact and droplet precautions for healthcare workers caring for suspected COVID-19 patients, whereas the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has initially recommended airborne precautions.\n The 1- to 2-meter (?36 feet) rule of spatial separation is central to droplet precautions and assumes that large droplets do not travel further than 2 meters (?6 feet).\n We aimed to review the evidence for horizontal distance traveled by droplets and the guidelines issued by the WHO, CDC, and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control on respiratory protection for COVID-19. We found that the evidence base for current guidelines is sparse, and the available data do not support the 1- to 2-meter (?36 feet) rule of spatial separation.\n Of 10 studies on horizontal droplet distance, 8 showed droplets travel more than 2 meters (?6 feet), in some cases up to 8 meters (?26 feet).\n Several studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) support aerosol transmission, and 1 study documented virus at a distance of 4 meters (?13 feet) from the patient.\n Moreover, evidence suggests that infections cannot neatly be separated into the dichotomy of droplet versus airborne transmission routes.\n Available studies also show that SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in the air, and remain viable 3 hours after aerosolization.\n The weight of combined evidence supports airborne precautions for the occupational health and safety of health workers treating patients with COVID-19.","id":"PMC7184471","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Prateek","surname":"Bahl","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Con","surname":"Doolan","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Con","surname":"Doolan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Charitha","surname":"de Silva","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Abrar Ahmad","surname":"Chughtai","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lydia","surname":"Bourouiba","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"C Raina","surname":"MacIntyre","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.7326/M20-2306","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Ventilation Techniques and Risk for Transmission of Coronavirus Disease, Including COVID-19","abstract":"Background:\nMechanical ventilation is used to treat respiratory failure in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n\n\nPurpose:\nTo review multiple streams of evidence regarding the benefits and harms of ventilation techniques for coronavirus infections, including that causing COVID-19. (PROSPERO registration: CRD42020178187)\nData Sources:\n21 standard, World Health Organizationspecific and COVID-19specific databases, without language restrictions, until 1 May 2020.\nStudy Selection:\nStudies of any design and language comparing different oxygenation approaches in patients with coronavirus infections, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), or with hypoxemic respiratory failure.\n\n Animal, mechanistic, laboratory, and preclinical evidence was gathered regarding aerosol dispersion of coronavirus.\n\n Studies evaluating risk for virus transmission to health care workers from aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) were included.\n\n\nData Extraction:\nIndependent and duplicate screening, data abstraction, and risk of bias assessment (GRADE for certainty of evidence and AMSTAR 2 for included systematic reviews).\n\n\nData Synthesis:\n123 studies were eligible (45 on COVID-19, 70 on SARS, 8 on MERS), but only 5 studies (1 on COVID-19, 3 on SARS, 1 on MERS) adjusted for important confounders.\n\n A study in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 reported slightly higher mortality with noninvasive ventilation (NIV) than with invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), but 2 opposing studies, 1 in patients with MERS and 1 in patients with SARS, suggest a reduction in mortality with NIV (very low-certainty evidence).\n\n Two studies in patients with SARS report a reduction in mortality with NIV compared with no mechanical ventilation (low-certainty evidence).\n\n Two systematic reviews suggest a large reduction in mortality with NIV compared with conventional oxygen therapy.\n\n Other included studies suggest increased odds of transmission from AGPs.\n\n\nLimitation:\nDirect studies in COVID-19 are limited and poorly reported.\n\n\nConclusion:\nIndirect and low-certainty evidence suggests that use of NIV, similar to IMV, probably reduces mortality but may increase the risk for transmission of COVID-19 to health care workers.\n\n\nPrimary Funding Source:\nWorld Health

events.\n Taiwan has a comprehensive network of laboratory, epidemiologic, and early warning surveillance systems with nationwide representation.\n Hospitals and clinical laboratories have deployed automatic reporting mechanisms since 2014 and have effectively improved timeliness of infectious disease and laboratory data reporting.\n In June 2016, the capacity of real-time surveillance in Taiwan was externally assessed and was found to have a demonstrated and sustainable capability.\n We describe Taiwan's disease surveillance system and use surveillance efforts for influenza and Zika virus as examples of surveillance capability.\n Timely and integrated influenza information showed a higher level and extended pattern of influenza activity during the 2015-16 season, which ensured prompt information dissemination and the coordination of response operations.\n Taiwan also has well-developed disease detection systems and was the first country to report imported cases of Zika virus from Miami Beach and Singapore.\n This illustrates a high level of awareness and willingness among health workers to report emerging infectious diseases, and highlights the robust and sensitive nature of Taiwan's surveillance system.\n These 2 examples demonstrate the flexibility of the surveillance systems in Taiwan to adapt to emerging infectious diseases and major communicable diseases.\n Through participation in the GHSA, Taiwan can more actively collaborate with national counterparts and use its expertise to strengthen global and regional surveillance capacity in the Asia Pacific and in

novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·058·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·013·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission,

cases and contacts","abstract":"Background\nIsolation of cases and contact tracing is used to control outbreaks of infectious diseases, and has been used for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n\n Whether this strategy will achieve control depends on characteristics of both the pathogen and the response.\n\n Here we use a mathematical model to assess if isolation and contact tracing are able to control onwards transmission from imported cases of COVID-19.\nMethods\nWe developed a stochastic transmission model, parameterised to the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\n We used the model to quantify the potential effectiveness of contact tracing and isolation of cases at controlling a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-like pathogen.\n\n We considered scenarios that varied in the number of initial cases, the basic reproduction number (R0), the delay from symptom onset to isolation, the probability that contacts were traced, the proportion of transmission that occurred before symptom onset, and the proportion of subclinical infections.\n\n We assumed isolation prevented all further transmission in the model.\n\n Outbreaks were deemed controlled if transmission ended within 12 weeks or before 5000 cases in total.\n\n We measured the success of controlling outbreaks using isolation and contact tracing, and quantified the weekly maximum number of cases traced to measure feasibility of public health effort.\n\n\nFindings\nSimulated outbreaks starting with five initial cases, an R0 of 1·5, and 0% transmission before symptom onset could be controlled even with low contact tracing probability; however, the probability of controlling an outbreak decreased with the number of initial cases, when R0 was 2·5 or 3·5 and with more transmission before symptom onset.\n\n Across different initial numbers of cases, the majority of scenarios with an R0 of 1·5 were controllable with less than 50% of contacts successfully traced.\n\n To control the majority of outbreaks, for R0 of 2·5 more than 70% of contacts had to be traced, and for an R0 of 3·5 more than 90% of contacts had to be traced.\n\n The delay between symptom onset and isolation had the largest role in determining whether an outbreak was controllable when R0 was 1·5. For R0 values of 2·5 or 3·5, if there were 40 initial cases, contact tracing and isolation were only potentially feasible when less than 1% of transmission occurred before symptom onset.\n\n\nInterpretation\nIn most scenarios, highly effective contact tracing and case isolation is enough to control a new outbreak of COVID-19 within 3 months.\n\n The probability of control decreases with long delays from symptom onset to isolation, fewer cases ascertained by contact tracing, and increasing transmission before symptoms.\n\n This model can be modified to reflect updated transmission characteristics and more specific definitions of outbreak control to assess the potential success of local response efforts.\n\n\nFunding\nWellcome Trust, Global Challenges Research Fund, and Health Data Research UK.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7097845","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Joel","surname":"Hellewell","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sam","surname":"Abbott","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Amy","surname":"Gimma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nikos I","surname":"Bosse","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christopher I","surname":"Jarvis","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Timothy W","surname":"Russell","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"James D","surname":"Munday","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Adam J","surname":"Kucharski","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"W John","surname":"Edmunds","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fiona","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Stefan","surname":"Flasche","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Billy J","surname":"Quilty","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nicholas","surname":"Davies","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Samuel","surname":"Clifford","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Petra","surname":"Klepac","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mark","surname":"Jit","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Charlie","surname":"Diamond","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hamish","surname":"Gibbs","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kevin","surname":"van Zandvoort","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sebastian","surname":"Funk","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sebastian","surname":"Funk","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sebastian","surname":"Funk","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rosalind M","surname":"Eggo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":" Home care for patients with COVID-19 presenting with mild symptoms and management of their contacts.

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020.

period, delays between symptom onset and seeking care at a hospital or clinic were longer in Hubei province than in other provinces in mainland China and internationally.\n\n In mainland China, these delays decreased from 5 days before Jan 18, 2020, to 2 days thereafter until Jan 31, 2020 (p=0·0009).\n\n Although our sample captures only 507 (5·2%) of 9826 patients with COVID-19 reported by official sources during the analysed period, our data align with an official report published by Chinese authorities on Jan 28, 2020.\nInterpretation\nNews reports and social media can help reconstruct the progression of an outbreak and provide detailed patient-level data in the context of a health emergency.\n\n The availability of a central physician-oriented social network facilitated the compilation of publicly available COVID-19 data in China.\n\n As the outbreak progresses, social media and news reports will probably capture a diminishing fraction of COVID-19 cases globally due to reporting fatigue and overwhelmed health-care systems.\n\n In the early stages of an outbreak, availability of public datasets is important to encourage analytical efforts by independent teams and provide robust evidence to guide interventions.\n\n\nFunding\nFogarty International Center, US National Institutes of

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·058·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR

city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 3666 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 36 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 610 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

international spread of the 2019-nCoV outbreak originating in Wuhan, China: a modelling study","abstract":"Background\nSince Dec 31, 2019, the Chinese city of Wuhan has reported an outbreak of atypical pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n Cases have been exported to other Chinese cities, as well as internationally, threatening to trigger a global outbreak.\n\n Here, we provide an estimate of the size of the epidemic in Wuhan on the basis of the number of cases exported from Wuhan to cities outside mainland China and forecast the extent of the domestic and global public health risks of epidemics, accounting for social and non-pharmaceutical prevention interventions.\n\n\nMethods\nWe used data from Dec 31, 2019, to Jan 28, 2020, on the number of cases exported from Wuhan internationally (known days of symptom onset from Dec 25, 2019, to Jan 19, 2020) to infer the number of infections in Wuhan from Dec 1, 2019, to Jan 25, 2020. Cases exported domestically were then estimated.\n\n We forecasted the national and global spread of 2019-nCoV, accounting for the effect of the metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan and surrounding cities, which began Jan 2324, 2020. We used data on monthly flight bookings from the Official Aviation Guide and data on human mobility across more than 300 prefecture-level cities in mainland China from the Tencent database.\n\n Data on confirmed cases were obtained from the reports published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n Serial interval estimates were based on previous studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV).\n\n A susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered metapopulation model was used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China.\n\n The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credibile interval (CrI).\n\n\nFindings\nIn our baseline scenario, we estimated that the basic reproductive number for 2019-nCoV was 2·68 (95% CrI 2·472·86) and that 75?815 individuals (95% CrI 37?304130?330) have been infected in Wuhan as of Jan 25, 2020. The epidemic doubling time was 6·4 days (95% CrI 5·87·1).\n\n We estimated that in the baseline scenario, Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen had imported 461 (95% CrI 227805), 113 (57193), 98 (49168), 111 (56191), and 80 (40139) infections from Wuhan, respectively.\n\n If the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV were similar everywhere domestically and over time, we inferred that epidemics are already growing exponentially in multiple major cities of China with a lag time behind the Wuhan outbreak of about 12 weeks.\n\n\nInterpretation\nGiven that 2019-nCoV is no longer contained within Wuhan, other major Chinese cities are probably sustaining localised outbreaks.\n\n Large cities overseas with close transport links to China could also become outbreak epicentres, unless substantial public health interventions at both the population and personal levels are implemented immediately.\n\n Independent self-sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally could become inevitable because of substantial exportation of presymptomatic cases and in the absence of large-scale public health interventions.\n\n Preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be readied for quick deployment globally.\n\n\nFunding\nHealth and Medical Research Fund (Hong Kong,

Jan 31, 2020, in China.\n\n We also compiled a list of internationally exported cases of COVID-19 from global news media sources (Kyodo News, The Straits Times, and CNN), national governments, and health authorities.\n\n We assessed trends in the epidemiology of COVID-19 and studied the outbreak progression across China, assessing delays between symptom onset, seeking care at a hospital or clinic, and reporting, before and after Jan 18, 2020, as awareness of the outbreak increased.\n\n All data were made publicly available in real time.\n\n\nFindings\nWe collected data for 507 patients with COVID-19 reported between Jan 13 and Jan 31, 2020, including 364 from mainland China and 143 from outside of China.\n\n 281 (55%) patients were male and the median age was 46 years (IQR 3560).\n\n Few patients (13 [3%]) were younger than 15 years and the age profile of Chinese patients adjusted for baseline demographics confirmed a deficit of infections among children.\n\n Across the analysed period, delays between symptom onset and seeking care at a hospital or clinic were longer in Hubei province than in other provinces in mainland China and internationally.\n\n In mainland China, these delays decreased from 5 days before Jan 18, 2020, to 2 days thereafter until Jan 31, 2020 (p=0·0009).\n\n Although our sample captures only 507 (5·2%) of 9826 patients with COVID-19 reported by official sources during the analysed period, our data align with an official report published by Chinese authorities on Jan 28, 2020.\nInterpretation\nNews reports and social media can help reconstruct the progression of an outbreak and provide detailed patient-level data in the context of a health emergency.\n\n The availability of a central physician-oriented social network facilitated the compilation of publicly available COVID-19 data in China.\n\n As the outbreak progresses, social media and news reports will probably capture a diminishing fraction of COVID-19 cases globally due to reporting fatigue and overwhelmed health-care systems.\n\n In the early stages of an outbreak, availability of public datasets is important to encourage analytical efforts by independent teams and provide robust evidence to guide interventions.\n\n\nFunding\nFogarty International Center, US National Institutes of

Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in

Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7121484","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Qun","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuhua","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoye","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yeqing","surname":"Tong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ruiqi","surname":"Ren","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kathy S.M.","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Eric H.Y.","surname":"Lau","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jessica Y.","surname":"Wong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuesen","surname":"Xing","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nijuan","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chao","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tian","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Man","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wenxiao","surname":"Tu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chuding","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lianmei","surname":"Jin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rui","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Suhua","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rui","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yinbo","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ge","surname":"Shao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhongfa","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhiqiang","surname":"Deng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Boxi","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhitao","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yanping","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guoqing","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tommy T.Y.","surname":"Lam","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Joseph T.","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"George F.","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Benjamin J.","surname":"Cowling","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gabriel M.","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zijian","surname":"Feng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1098/rspb.2006.0015","date":"1970-01-01","title":"What is the best control strategy for multiple infectious disease outbreaks?","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1101/2020.03.05.20031088","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Comparative Impact of Individual Quarantine vs. Active Monitoring of Contacts for the Mitigation of COVID-19: a modelling study","abstract":"Background\nid='P4'>Voluntary individual quarantine and voluntary active monitoring of contacts are core disease control strategies for emerging infectious diseases, such as COVID-19.

For R0 values of 2·5 or 3·5, if there were 40 initial cases, contact tracing and isolation were only potentially feasible when less than 1% of transmission occurred before symptom onset.\n\n\nInterpretation\nIn most scenarios, highly effective contact tracing and case isolation is enough to control a new outbreak of COVID-19 within 3 months.\n\n The probability of control decreases with long delays from symptom onset to isolation, fewer cases ascertained by contact tracing, and increasing transmission before symptoms.\n\n This model can be modified to reflect updated transmission characteristics and more specific definitions of outbreak control to assess the potential success of local response efforts.\n\n\nFunding\nWellcome Trust, Global Challenges Research Fund, and Health Data Research UK.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7097845","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Joel","surname":"Hellewell","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sam","surname":"Abbott","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Amy","surname":"Gimma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nikos I","surname":"Bosse","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christopher I","surname":"Jarvis","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Timothy W","surname":"Russell","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"James D","surname":"Munday","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Adam J","surname":"Kucharski","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"W John","surname":"Edmunds","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fiona","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Stefan","surname":"Flasche","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Billy J","surname":"Quilty","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nicholas","surname":"Davies","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Samuel","surname":"Clifford","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Petra","surname":"Klepac","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mark","surname":"Jit","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Charlie","surname":"Diamond","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hamish","surname":"Gibbs","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kevin","surname":"van Zandvoort","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sebastian","surname":"Funk","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sebastian","surname":"Funk","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sebastian","surname":"Funk","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rosalind M","surname":"Eggo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1038/nature04795","date":"2006-04-11","title":"Strategies for mitigating an influenza pandemic","abstract":"Supplementary information\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1038/nature04795) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7095311","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Neil M.","surname":"Ferguson","email":"neil.ferguson@imperial.ac.uk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Derek A.

the US health-care workforce and net mortality: a modelling study","abstract":"Background\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is leading to social (physical) distancing policies worldwide, including in the USA.\n\n Some of the first actions taken by governments are the closing of schools.\n\n The evidence that mandatory school closures reduce the number of cases and, ultimately, mortality comes from experience with influenza or from models that do not include the effect of school closure on the health-care labour force.\n\n The potential benefits from school closures need to be weighed against costs of health-care worker absenteeism associated with additional child-care obligations.\n\n In this study, we aimed to measure child-care obligations for US health-care workers arising from school closures when these are used as a social distancing measure.\n\n We then assessed how important the contribution of health-care workers would have to be in reducing mortality for their absenteeism due to child-care obligations to undo the benefits of school closures in reducing the number of cases.\n\n\nMethods\nFor this modelling analysis, we used data from the monthly releases of the US Current Population Survey to characterise the family structure and probable within-household child-care options of US health-care workers.\n\n We accounted for the occupation within the health-care sector, state, and household structure to identify the segments of the health-care workforce that are most exposed to child-care obligations from school closures.\n\n We used these estimates to identify the critical level at which the importance of health-care labour supply in increasing the survival probability of a patient with COVID-19 would undo the benefits of school closures and ultimately increase cumulative mortality.\n\n\nFindings\nBetween January, 2018, and January, 2020, the US Current Population Survey included information on more than 3·1 million individuals across 1·3 million households.\n\n We found that the US health-care sector has some of the highest child-care obligations in the USA, with 28·8% (95% CI 28·529·1) of the health-care workforce needing to provide care for children aged 312 years.\n\n Assuming non-working adults or a sibling aged 13 years or older can provide child care, 15·0% (14·815·2) of the health-care workforce would still be in need of child care during a school closure.\n\n We observed substantial variation within the health-care system.\n\n We estimated that, combined with reasonable parameters for COVID-19 such as a 15·0% case reduction from school closings and 2·0% baseline mortality rate, a 15·0% decrease in the health-care labour force would need to decrease the survival probability per percent health-care worker lost by 17·6% for a school closure to increase cumulative mortality.\n\n Our model estimates that if the infection mortality rate of COVID-19 increases from 2·00% to 2·35% when the health-care workforce declines by 15·0%, school closures could lead to a greater number of deaths than they prevent.\n\n\nInterpretation\nSchool closures come with many trade-offs, and can create unintended child-care obligations.\n\n Our results suggest that the potential contagion prevention from school closures needs to be carefully weighted with the potential loss of health-care workers from the standpoint of reducing cumulative mortality due to COVID-19, in the absence of mitigating measures.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7270508","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jude","surname":"Bayham","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Eli

epidemiological studies of SARS comparing epidemiologic features across regions.\n\n The aim of this study is to identify similarities and differences in SARS epidemiology in three populations with similar host and viral genotype.\n\n\nMethods\nWe present a comparative epidemiologic analysis of SARS, based on an integrated dataset with 3,336 SARS patients from Hong Kong, Beijing and Taiwan, epidemiological and clinical characteristics such as incubation, onset-to-admission, onset-to-discharge and onset-to-death periods, case fatality ratios (CFRs) and presenting symptoms are described and compared between regions.\n\n We further explored the influence of demographic and clinical variables on the apparently large differences in CFRs between the three regions.\n\n\nResults\nAll three regions showed similar incubation periods and progressive shortening of the onset-to-admission interval through the epidemic.\n\n Adjusted for sex, health care worker status and nosocomial setting, older age was associated with a higher fatality, with adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 2.10 (95% confidence interval: 1.45, 3.04) for those aged 51-60; AOR: 4.57 (95% confidence interval: 3.32, 7.30) for

the importance of a common data collection platform, especially in an emerging epidemic, in order to identify and explain consistencies and differences in the eventual clinical and public health

cases up to Aug 8, 2013, is 940 (95% CI 2902200), indicating that at least 62% of human symptomatic cases have not been detected.\n\n We find that the case-fatality ratio of primary cases detected via routine surveillance (74%; 95% CI 4991) is biased upwards because of detection bias; the case-fatality ratio of secondary cases was 20% (742).\n\n Detection of milder cases (or clinical

patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found

reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (?18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.\n\n\nFindings\n191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital.\n\n 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients).\n\n Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·031·17, per year increase; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·6112·23; p&lt;0·0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL (18·42, 2·64128·55; p=0·0033) on admission.\n\n Median duration of viral shedding was 20·0 days (IQR 17·024·0) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors.\n\n The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage.\n\n Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.\n\n\nFunding\nChinese Academy of Medical Sciences Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences; National Science Grant for Distinguished Young Scholars; National Key Research and Development Program of China; The Beijing Science and Technology Project; and Major Projects of National Science and Technology on New Drug Creation and Development.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7270627","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Fei","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ronghui","surname":"Du","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guohui","surname":"Fan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhibo","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jie","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yeming","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoying","surname":"Gu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lulu","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xudong","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiuyang","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shengjin","surname":"Tu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hua","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Cao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"10.1001/jama.2020.1097","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The novel coronavirus originating in Wuhan, China: challenges for global health governance","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1101/2020.02.07.937862","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus: the species and its viruses:a statement of the Coronavirus Study Group","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Short term outcome and risk factors for adverse clinical outcomes in adults with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2001316","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Early Transmission Dynamics in Wuhan, China, of Novel CoronavirusInfected Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nThe initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020.

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 311) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with

of the severity of coronavirus disease 2019: a model-based analysis","abstract":"Background\nIn the face of rapidly changing data, a range of case fatality ratio estimates for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been produced that differ substantially in magnitude.\n\n We aimed to provide robust estimates, accounting for censoring and ascertainment biases.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected individual-case data for patients who died from COVID-19 in Hubei, mainland China (reported by national and provincial health commissions to Feb 8, 2020), and for cases outside of mainland China (from government or ministry of health websites and media reports for 37 countries, as well as Hong Kong and Macau, until Feb 25, 2020).\n\n These individual-case data were used to estimate the time between onset of symptoms and outcome (death or discharge from hospital).\n\n We next obtained age-stratified estimates of the case fatality ratio by relating the aggregate distribution of cases to the observed cumulative deaths in China, assuming a constant attack rate by age and adjusting for demography and age-based and location-based under-ascertainment.\n\n We also estimated the case fatality ratio from individual line-list data on 1334 cases identified outside of mainland China.\n\n Using data on the prevalence of PCR-confirmed cases in international residents repatriated from China, we obtained age-stratified estimates of the infection fatality ratio.\n\n Furthermore, data on age-stratified severity in a subset of 3665 cases from China were used to estimate the proportion of infected individuals who are likely to require hospitalisation.\n\n\nFindings\nUsing data on 24 deaths that occurred in mainland China and 165 recoveries outside of China, we estimated the mean duration from onset of symptoms to death to be 17·8 days (95% credible interval [CrI] 16·919·2) and to hospital discharge to be 24·7 days (22·928·1).\n\n In all laboratory confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases from mainland China (n=70?117), we estimated a crude case fatality ratio (adjusted for censoring) of 3·67% (95% CrI 3·563·80).\n\n However, after further adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment, we obtained a best estimate of the case fatality ratio in China of 1·38% (1·231·53), with substantially higher ratios in older age groups (0·32% [0·270·38] in those aged &lt;60 years vs 6·4% [5·77·2] in those aged ?60 years), up to 13·4% (11·215·9) in those aged 80 years or older.\n\n Estimates of case fatality ratio from international cases stratified by age were consistent with those from China (parametric estimate 1·4% [0·43·5] in those aged &lt;60 years [n=360] and 4·5% [1·811·1] in those aged ?60 years [n=151]).\n\n Our estimated overall infection fatality ratio for China was 0·66% (0·391·33), with an increasing profile with age.\n\n Similarly, estimates of the proportion of infected individuals likely to be hospitalised increased with age up to a maximum of 18·4% (11·037·6) in those aged 80 years or older.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThese early estimates give an indication of the fatality ratio across the spectrum of COVID-19 disease and show a strong age gradient in risk of death.\n\n\nFunding\nUK Medical Research

Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.\n\n\nFindings\n191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital.\n\n 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients).\n\n Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·031·17, per year increase; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·6112·23; p&lt;0·0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL (18·42, 2·64128·55; p=0·0033) on admission.\n\n Median duration of viral shedding was 20·0 days (IQR 17·024·0) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors.\n\n The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage.\n\n Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.\n\n\nFunding\nChinese Academy of Medical Sciences Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences;

week and public holiday effects: improving a national daily syndromic surveillance service for detecting public health threats","abstract":"Background\nAs service provision and patient behaviour varies by day, healthcare data used for public health surveillance can exhibit large day of the week effects.\n\n These regular effects are further complicated by the impact of public holidays.\n\n Real-time syndromic surveillance requires the daily analysis of a range of healthcare data sources, including family doctor consultations (called general practitioners, or GPs, in the UK).\n\n Failure to adjust for such reporting biases during analysis of syndromic GP surveillance data could lead to misinterpretations including false alarms or delays in the detection of outbreaks.\n\n\nMethods\nThe extended working day moving average was developed.\n\n This is a further data-driven method for adding a smooth trend curve to a time series graph of daily healthcare data, that aims to take both public holiday and day of the week effects into account.\n\n It is based on the assumption that the number of people seeking healthcare services is a combination of illness levels/severity and the ability or desire of patients to seek healthcare each day.\n\n The extended working day moving average was compared to the seven-day and working day moving averages through application to data from two syndromic indicators from the GP in-hours syndromic surveillance system managed by Public Health England.\n\n\nResults\nThe extended working day moving average successfully smoothed the syndromic healthcare data by taking into account the combined day of the week and public holiday effects.\n\n In comparison, the seven-day and working day moving averages were unable to account for all these effects, which led to misleading smoothing curves.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe results from this study make it possible to identify trends and unusual activity in syndromic surveillance data from GP services in real-time independently of the effects caused by day of the week and public holidays, thereby improving the public health action resulting from the analysis of these data.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5438549","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Elizabeth","surname":"Buckingham-Jeffery","email":"E.Buckingham-Jeffery@manchester.ac.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Roger","surname":"Morbey","email":"Roger.Morbey@phe.gov.uk","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Roger","surname":"Morbey","email":"Roger.Morbey@phe.gov.uk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Thomas","surname":"House","email":"thomas.house@manchester.ac.uk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Alex

Extending our method to May 16, 2020, we estimate that cumulative symptomatic incidence ranges from 6.0 to 10.3 million, as opposed to 1.5 million positive test counts.\n The proposed combination of approaches may prove useful in assessing the burden of COVID-19 during resurgences in the US and other countries with comparable surveillance systems.\n","id":"PMC7310656","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Fred S.","surname":"Lu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Andre T.","surname":"Nguyen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nicholas B.","surname":"Link","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jessica T.","surname":"Davis","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Matteo","surname":"Chinazzi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xinyue","surname":"Xiong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Alessandro","surname":"Vespignani","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Marc","surname":"Lipsitch","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mauricio","surname":"Santillana","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Organization WH.

model-based analysis","abstract":"Background\nIn the face of rapidly changing data, a range of case fatality ratio estimates for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been produced that differ substantially in magnitude.\n\n We aimed to provide robust estimates, accounting for censoring and ascertainment biases.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected individual-case data for patients who died from COVID-19 in Hubei, mainland China (reported by national and provincial health commissions to Feb 8, 2020), and for cases outside of mainland China (from government or ministry of health websites and media reports for 37 countries, as well as Hong Kong and Macau, until Feb 25, 2020).\n\n These individual-case data were used to estimate the time between onset of symptoms and outcome (death or discharge from hospital).\n\n We next obtained age-stratified estimates of the case fatality ratio by relating the aggregate distribution of cases to the observed cumulative deaths in China, assuming a constant attack rate by age and adjusting for demography and age-based and location-based under-ascertainment.\n\n We also estimated the case fatality ratio from individual line-list data on 1334 cases identified outside of mainland China.\n\n Using data on the prevalence of PCR-confirmed cases in international residents repatriated from China, we obtained age-stratified estimates of the infection fatality ratio.\n\n Furthermore, data on age-stratified severity in a subset of 3665 cases from China were used to estimate the proportion of infected individuals who are likely to require hospitalisation.\n\n\nFindings\nUsing data on 24 deaths that occurred in mainland China and 165 recoveries outside of China, we estimated the mean duration from onset of symptoms to death to be 17·8 days (95% credible interval [CrI] 16·919·2) and to hospital discharge to be 24·7 days (22·928·1).\n\n In all laboratory confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases from mainland China (n=70?117), we estimated a crude case fatality ratio (adjusted for censoring) of 3·67% (95% CrI 3·563·80).\n\n However, after further adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment, we obtained a best estimate of the case fatality ratio in China of 1·38% (1·231·53), with substantially higher ratios in older age groups (0·32% [0·270·38] in those aged &lt;60 years vs 6·4% [5·77·2] in those aged ?60 years), up to 13·4% (11·215·9) in those aged 80 years or older.\n\n Estimates of case fatality ratio from international cases stratified by age were consistent with those from China (parametric estimate 1·4% [0·43·5] in those aged &lt;60 years [n=360] and 4·5% [1·811·1] in those aged ?60 years [n=151]).\n\n Our estimated overall infection fatality ratio for China was 0·66% (0·391·33), with an increasing profile with age.\n\n Similarly, estimates of the proportion of infected individuals likely to be hospitalised increased with age up to a maximum of 18·4% (11·037·6) in those aged 80 years or older.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThese early estimates give an indication of the fatality ratio across the spectrum of COVID-19 disease and show a strong age gradient in risk of death.\n\n\nFunding\nUK

(IFR).\n\n This differs from the case fatality rate (CFR) as an estimate of the number of deaths and as a proportion of the total number of cases, including those who are mild and asymptomatic.\n\n While the CFR is extremely valuable for experts, IFR is increasingly being called for by policy makers and the lay public as an estimate of the overall mortality from COVID-19.\nMethods\nPubmed, Medline, SSRN, and Medrxiv were searched using a set of terms and Boolean operators on 25/04/2020 and re-searched on 14/05/2020, 21/05/2020 and 16/06/2020. Articles were screened for inclusion by both authors.\n\n Meta-analysis was performed in Stata 15.1 by using the metan command, based on IFR and confidence intervals extracted from each study.\n\n Google/Google Scholar was used to assess the grey literature relating to government reports.\n\n\nResults\nAfter exclusions, there were 24 estimates of IFR included in the final meta-analysis, from a wide range of countries, published between February and June 2020.\nConclusion\nBased on a systematic review and meta-analysis of published evidence on COVID-19 until July 2020, the IFR of the disease across populations is 0.68% (0.53%0.82%).\n\n However, due to very high heterogeneity in the meta-analysis, it is difficult to know if this represents a completely unbiased point estimate.\n\n It is likely that, due to age and perhaps underlying comorbidities in the population, different places will experience different IFRs due to the disease.\n\n Given issues with mortality recording, it is also likely that this represents an underestimate of the true IFR figure.\n\n More research looking at age-stratified IFR is urgently needed to inform policymaking on this front.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7524446","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Gideon","surname":"Meyerowitz-Katz","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Lea","surname":"Merone","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Geographical differences in weekly ILI activity within each data source were also assessed using relative mean differences and time series heatmaps.\n\n National and regional age-adjusted health careseeking percentages were calculated for each influenza season by dividing the number of FNY participants who sought medical care for ILI symptoms by the total number of ILI reports within an influenza season.\n\n Pearson correlations were used to assess the association between the health careseeking percentages and baselines for each surveillance data source.\n\n\nResults\nWe observed consistent differences in ILI activity across geographical areas for CDC ILINet and athenahealth data.\n\n ILI activity for FNY displayed little variation across geographical areas, whereas differences in ILI activity for HealthTweets.\n\norg were associated with the total number of tweets within a geographical area.\n\n The percentage of FNY participants who sought health care for ILI symptoms differed slightly across geographical areas, and these percentages were positively correlated with CDC ILINet and athenahealth baselines.\n\n\nConclusions\nOur findings suggest that differences in ILI activity across geographical areas as reported by a given surveillance system may not accurately reflect true differences in the prevalence of ILI.\n\n Instead, these differences may reflect systematic collection and aggregation biases that are particular to each system and consistent across influenza seasons.\n\n These findings are potentially relevant in the real-time analysis of the influenza season and in the definition of unbiased forecast models.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6777281","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Gunther","surname":"Eysenbach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Matthew","surname":"Biggerstaff","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Matthew","surname":"Biggerstaff","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Onicio","surname":"Leal

Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7121484","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Qun","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuhua","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoye","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yeqing","surname":"Tong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ruiqi","surname":"Ren","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kathy S.M.","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Eric H.Y.","surname":"Lau","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jessica Y.","surname":"Wong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuesen","surname":"Xing","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nijuan","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chao","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tian","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Man","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wenxiao","surname":"Tu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chuding","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lianmei","surname":"Jin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rui","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Suhua","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rui","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yinbo","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ge","surname":"Shao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhongfa","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhiqiang","surname":"Deng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Boxi","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhitao","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yanping","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guoqing","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tommy T.Y.","surname":"Lam","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Joseph T.","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"George F.","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Benjamin J.","surname":"Cowling","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gabriel M.","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zijian","surname":"Feng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Gutierrez E, Rubli A, Tavares T.

infections, which might share some aspects of transmission dynamics with COVID-19.\nMethods\nWe analysed data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, influenza surveillance data in outpatients of all ages, and influenza hospitalisations in children.\n\n We estimated the daily effective reproduction number (Rt) for COVID-19 and influenza A H1N1 to estimate changes in transmissibility over time.\n\n

measured by Rt has remained at approximately 1 for 8 weeks in Hong Kong.\n\n Influenza transmission declined substantially after the implementation of social distancing measures and changes in population behaviours in late January, with a 44% (95% CI 3453%) reduction in transmissibility in the community, from an estimated Rt of 1·28 (95% CI 1·261·30) before the start of the school closures to 0·72 (0·700·74) during the closure weeks.\n\n Similarly, a 33% (2443%) reduction in transmissibility was seen based on paediatric hospitalisation rates, from an Rt of 1·10 (1·061·12) before the start of the school closures to 0·73 (0·680·77) after school closures.\n\n Among respondents to the surveys, 74·5%, 97·5%, and 98·8% reported wearing masks when going out, and 61·3%, 90·2%, and 85·1% reported avoiding crowded places in surveys 1 (n=1008), 2 (n=1000), and 3 (n=1005), respectively.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur study shows that non-pharmaceutical interventions (including border restrictions, quarantine and isolation, distancing, and changes in population behaviour) were associated with reduced transmission of COVID-19 in Hong Kong, and are also likely to have substantially reduced influenza transmission in early February, 2020.\nFunding\nHealth and Medical Research Fund, Hong

China outside Hubei after control measures, and second-wave scenario planning: a modelling impact assessment","abstract":"Background\nAs of March 18, 2020, 13?415 confirmed cases and 120 deaths related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in mainland China, outside Hubei provincethe epicentre of the outbreakhad been reported.\n\n Since late January, massive public health interventions have been implemented nationwide to contain the outbreak.\n\n We provide an impact assessment of the transmissibility and severity of COVID-19 during the first wave in mainland Chinese locations outside Hubei.\n\n\nMethods\nWe estimated the instantaneous reproduction number (Rt) of COVID-19 in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Wenzhou, and the ten Chinese provinces that had the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases; and the confirmed case-fatality risk (cCFR) in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Wenzhou, and all 31 Chinese provinces.\n\n We used a susceptibleinfectiousrecovered model to show the potential effects of relaxing containment measures after the first wave of infection, in anticipation of a possible second wave.\n\n\nFindings\nIn all selected cities and provinces, the Rt decreased substantially since Jan 23, when control measures were implemented, and have since remained below 1. The cCFR outside Hubei was 0·98% (95% CI 0·821·16), which was almost five times lower than that in Hubei (5·91%, 5·736·09).\n\n Relaxing the interventions (resulting in Rt &gt;1) when the epidemic size was still small would increase the cumulative case count exponentially as a function of relaxation duration, even if aggressive interventions could subsequently push disease prevalence back to the baseline level.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe first wave of COVID-19 outside of Hubei has abated because of aggressive non-pharmaceutical interventions.\n\n However, given the substantial risk of viral reintroduction, particularly from overseas importation, close monitoring of Rt and cCFR is needed to inform strategies against a potential second wave to achieve an optimal balance between health and economic protection.\n\n\nFunding\nHealth and Medical Research Fund, Hong Kong,

severe coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) during the first epidemic wave on the west coast of the United States.\n\n\nDesign\nProspective cohort study.\n\n\nSetting\nKaiser Permanente integrated healthcare delivery systems serving populations in northern California, southern California, and Washington state.\n\n\nParticipants\n1840 people with a first acute hospital admission for confirmed covid-19 by 22 April 2020, among 9?596?321 healthcare plan enrollees.\n\n Analyses of hospital length of stay and clinical outcomes included 1328 people admitted by 9 April 2020 (534 in northern California, 711 in southern California, and 83 in Washington).\n\n\nMain outcome measures\nCumulative incidence of first acute hospital admission for confirmed covid-19, and subsequent probabilities of admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) and mortality, as well as duration of hospital stay and ICU stay.\n\n The effective reproduction number (RE) describing transmission dynamics was estimated for each region.\n\n\nResults\nAs of 22 April 2020, cumulative incidences of a first acute hospital admission for covid-19 were 15.6 per 100?000 cohort members in northern California, 23.3 per 100?000 in southern California, and 14.7 per 100?000 in Washington.\n\n Accounting for censoring of incomplete hospital stays among those admitted by 9 April 2020, the estimated median duration of stay among survivors was 9.3 days (with 95% staying 0.8 to 32.9 days) and among non-survivors was 12.7 days (1.6 to 37.7 days).\n\n The censoring adjusted probability of ICU admission for male patients was 48.5% (95% confidence interval 41.8% to 56.3%) and for female patients was 32.0% (26.6% to 38.4%).\n\n For patients requiring critical care, the median duration of ICU stay was 10.6 days (with 95% staying 1.3 to 30.8 days).\n\n The censoring adjusted case fatality ratio was 23.5% (95% confidence interval 19.6% to 28.2%) among male inpatients and 14.9% (11.8% to 18.6%) among female inpatients; mortality risk increased with age for both male and female patients.\n\n Reductions in RE were identified over the study period within each region.\n\n\nConclusions\nAmong residents of California and Washington state enrolled in Kaiser Permanente healthcare plans who were admitted to hospital with covid-19, the probabilities of ICU admission, of long hospital stay, and of mortality were identified to be high.\n\n Incidence rates of new hospital admissions have stabilized or declined in conjunction with implementation of social distancing

The geographical distribution of COVID-2019 cases showed that all 13 cites reported confirmed new cases after only five days of the first confirmed new case in Suzhou.\n\n The cases were concentrated in Nanjing, Suzhou, and Xuzhou with a high population density (over eight million people).\n\n The epidemiological features of COVID-2019 cases in Wuxi, Jiangsu showed that seven confirmed cases were tourists from others areas beyond Hubei Province.\n\n The longest incubation period of COVID-2019 was 19 days based on the onset of laboratory-confirmed cases.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe number of daily confirmed new cases in Jiangsu Province peaked around January 31 and then declined.\n\n This result emphasized that wartime control measures, such as putting cities on lockdown to limit population mobility in Jiangsu Province, resulted in dramatic reductions in COVID-19 cases.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7130124","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_elsevier_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ke-wei","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Jie","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Hua","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Xiao-long","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Qin-fang","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Fei-yu","surname":"Guo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Zhi-jie","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"                           Yang","surname":"Cheng","email":"woerseng@126.com","contributions":"1"}],"References depth 1":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A novel coronavirus outbreak of global health concern","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Novel coronavirus - Thailand (ex-China).

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 3666 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 36 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 610 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family

However, the evolutionary pathway of MERS-CoV is still unclear.\n A receptor binding domain (RBD) in the MERS-CoV envelope-embedded spike protein specifically engages human CD26 (hCD26) to initiate viral entry.\n The high sequence identity in the viral spike protein prompted us to investigate if HKU4 and HKU5 can recognize hCD26 for cell entry.\n We found that HKU4-RBD, but not HKU5-RBD, binds to hCD26, and pseudotyped viruses embedding HKU4 spike can infect cells via hCD26 recognition.\n The structure of the HKU4-RBD/hCD26 complex revealed a hCD26-binding mode similar overall to that observed for MERS-RBD.\n HKU4-RBD, however, is less adapted to hCD26 than MERS-RBD, explaining its lower affinity for receptor binding.\n Our findings support a bat origin for MERS-CoV and indicate

homologues in other coronaviruses.\n One of these is the 3b protein, which is encoded by the second open reading frame in subgenomic RNA 3 and contains 154 amino acids.\n Here, a detailed time-course study was performed to compare the apoptosis and necrosis profiles induced by full-length 3b, a 3b mutant that was deleted by 30 amino acids from the C terminus (3b?124-154) and the classical apoptosis inducer, Bax.\n Our results showed that Vero E6 cells transfected with a construct for expressing 3b underwent necrosis as early as 6 h after transfection and underwent simultaneous necrosis and apoptosis at later time-points.\n At all the time-points analysed, the apoptosis induced by the expression of 3b was less than the level induced by Bax but the level of necrosis was comparable.\n The 3b?124-154 mutant behaves in a similar manner indicating that the localization of the 3b protein does not seems to be important for the cell-death pathways since full-length 3b is localized predominantly to the nucleolus, while the mutant is found to be concentrated in the peri-nuclear regions.\n To our knowledge, this is the first report of the induction of necrosis by a SARS-CoV

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 3666 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 36 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 610 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile

we use a global metapopulation disease transmission model to project the impact of both domestic and international travel limitations on the national and international spread of the epidemic.\n The model is calibrated on the evidence of internationally imported cases before the implementation of the travel quarantine of Wuhan.\n By assuming a generation time of 7.5 days, the reproduction number is estimated to be 2.4 [90% CI 2.22.6].\n The median estimate for number of cases before the travel ban implementation on January 23, 2020 is 58,956 [90% CI 40,759  87,471] in Wuhan and 3,491 [90% CI 1,924  7,360] in other locations in Mainland China.\n The model shows that as of January 23, most Chinese cities had already received a considerable number of infected cases, and the travel quarantine delays the overall epidemic progression by only 3 to 5 days.\n The travel quarantine has a more marked effect at the international scale, where we estimate the number of case importations to be reduced by 80% until the end of February.\n Modeling results also indicate that sustained 90% travel restrictions to and from Mainland China only modestly affect the epidemic trajectory unless

We show that the effectiveness of different screening tools depends strongly on pathogen natural history and epidemiological features, as well as human factors in implementation and compliance.\n For pathogens with longer incubation periods, exposure risk detection dominates in growing epidemics, while fever becomes a better target in stable or declining epidemics.\n For pathogens with short

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7121484","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Qun","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuhua","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoye","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yeqing","surname":"Tong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ruiqi","surname":"Ren","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kathy S.M.","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Eric H.Y.","surname":"Lau","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jessica Y.","surname":"Wong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuesen","surname":"Xing","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nijuan","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chao","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tian","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Man","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wenxiao","surname":"Tu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chuding","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lianmei","surname":"Jin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rui","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Suhua","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rui","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yinbo","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ge","surname":"Shao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhongfa","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhiqiang","surname":"Deng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Boxi","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhitao","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yanping","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guoqing","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tommy T.Y.","surname":"Lam","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Joseph T.","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"George F.","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Benjamin J.","surname":"Cowling","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gabriel M.","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zijian","surname":"Feng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1101/2020.01.25.919787","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Time-varying transmission dynamics of novel coronavirus pneumonia in China","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1038/nature04153","date":"2005-08-22","title":"Superspreading and the effect of individual variation on disease emergence","abstract":"Supplementary information\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1038/nature04153) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7094981","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"J.

Wuhan, China that depend on reported cases in international travelers","abstract":"id='P4'>Risk of COVID-19 infection in Wuhan has been estimated using imported case counts of international travelers, often under the assumption that all cases in travelers are ascertained.\n Recent work indicates variation among countries in detection capacity for imported cases.\n Singapore has historically had very strong epidemiological surveillance and contact-tracing capacity and has shown in the COVID-19 epidemic evidence of a high sensitivity of case detection.\n We therefore used a Bayesian modeling approach to estimate the relative imported case detection capacity for other countries compared to that of Singapore.\n We estimate that the global ability to detect imported cases is 38% (95% HPDI 22%  64%) of Singapores capacity.\n Equivalently, an estimate of 2.8 (95% HPDI 1.5  4.4) times the current number of imported cases, could have been detected, if all countries had had the same detection capacity as Singapore.\n Using the second component of the Global Health Security index to stratify likely case-detection capacities, we found that the ability to detect imported cases relative to Singapore among high surveillance locations is 40% (95% HPDI 22%  67%), among intermediate surveillance locations it is 37% (95% HPDI 18%  68%), and among low surveillance locations it is 11% (95% HPDI 0%  42%).\n Using a simple mathematical model, we further find that treating all travelers as if they were residents (rather than accounting for the brief stay of some of these travelers in Wuhan) can modestly contribute to underestimation of prevalence as well.\n We conclude that estimates of case counts in Wuhan based on assumptions of perfect detection in travelers may be underestimated by several fold, and severity correspondingly overestimated by several fold.\n Undetected cases are likely in countries around the world, with greater risk in countries of low detection capacity and high connectivity to the epicenter of the outbreak.\n","id":"PMC7239063","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Rene","surname":"Niehus","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Pablo

data on their performance in airports.\n\n\nMethods\nITIS was used to measure cutaneous temperature in 1275 airline travellers who had agreed to tympanic temperature measurement and respiratory sampling.\n\n The prediction by ITIS of tympanic temperature (37.8°C and 37.5°C) and of influenza infection was assessed using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and estimated sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value (PPV).\n\n\nFindings\nUsing front of face ITIS for prediction of tympanic temperature ?37.8°C, the area under the ROC curve was 0.86 (95%CI 0.750.97) and setting sensitivity at 86% gave specificity of 71%.\n\n The PPV in this population of travellers, of whom 0.5% were febrile using this definition, was 1.5%.\n\n We identified influenza virus infection in 30 travellers (3 Type A and 27 Type B).\n\n For ITIS prediction of influenza infection the area under the ROC curve was 0.66 (0.560.75), a sensitivity of 87% gave specificity of 39%, and PPV of

in detecting fever but in this study, during a seasonal epidemic of predominantly influenza type B, the proportion of influenza-infected travellers who were febrile was low and ITIS were not much better than chance at identifying travellers likely to be influenza-infected.\n\n Although febrile illness is more common in influenza A infections than influenza B infections, many influenza A infections are afebrile.\n\n Our findings therefore suggest that ITIS is unlikely to be effective for entry screening of travellers to detect influenza infection with the intention of preventing entry

neighboring countries.\n Estimation of the basic reproduction number by means of mathematical modeling can be helpful for determining the potential and severity of an outbreak and providing critical information for identifying the type of disease interventions and intensity.\n A deterministic compartmental model was devised based on the clinical progression of the disease, epidemiological status of the individuals, and intervention measures.\n The estimations based on likelihood and model analysis show that the control reproduction number may be as high as 6.47 (95% CI 5.717.23).\n Sensitivity analyses show that interventions, such as intensive contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation, can effectively reduce the control reproduction number and transmission risk, with the effect of travel restriction adopted by Wuhan on 2019-nCoV infection in Beijing being almost equivalent to increasing quarantine by a 100 thousand baseline value.\n It is essential to assess how the expensive, resource-intensive measures implemented by the Chinese authorities can contribute to the prevention and control of the 2019-nCoV infection, and how long they should be maintained.\n Under the most restrictive measures, the outbreak is expected to peak within two weeks (since 23 January 2020) with a significant low peak value.\n With travel restriction (no imported exposed individuals to Beijing), the number of infected individuals in seven days will decrease by 91.14% in Beijing, compared with the scenario of no travel

Here, we provide an estimate of the size of the epidemic in Wuhan on the basis of the number of cases exported from Wuhan to cities outside mainland China and forecast the extent of the domestic and global public health risks of epidemics, accounting for social and non-pharmaceutical prevention interventions.\n\n\nMethods\nWe used data from Dec 31, 2019, to Jan 28, 2020, on the number of cases exported from Wuhan internationally (known days of symptom onset from Dec 25, 2019, to Jan 19, 2020) to infer the number of infections in Wuhan from Dec 1, 2019, to Jan 25, 2020. Cases exported domestically were then estimated.\n\n We forecasted the national and global spread of 2019-nCoV, accounting for the effect of the metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan and surrounding cities, which began Jan 2324, 2020. We used data on monthly flight bookings from the Official Aviation Guide and data on human mobility across more than 300 prefecture-level cities in mainland China from the Tencent database.\n\n Data on confirmed cases were obtained from the reports published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n Serial interval estimates were based on previous studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV).\n\n A susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered metapopulation model was used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China.\n\n The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credibile interval (CrI).\n\n\nFindings\nIn our baseline scenario, we estimated that the basic reproductive number for 2019-nCoV was 2·68 (95% CrI 2·472·86) and that 75?815 individuals (95% CrI 37?304130?330) have been infected in Wuhan as of Jan 25, 2020. The epidemic doubling time was 6·4 days (95% CrI 5·87·1).\n\n We estimated that in the baseline scenario, Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen had imported 461 (95% CrI 227805), 113 (57193), 98 (49168), 111 (56191), and 80 (40139) infections from Wuhan, respectively.\n\n If the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV were similar everywhere domestically and over time, we inferred that epidemics are already growing exponentially in multiple major cities of China with a lag time behind the Wuhan outbreak of about 12 weeks.\n\n\nInterpretation\nGiven that 2019-nCoV is no longer contained within Wuhan, other major Chinese cities are probably sustaining localised outbreaks.\n\n Large cities overseas with close transport links to China could also become outbreak epicentres, unless substantial public health interventions at both the population and personal levels are implemented immediately.\n\n Independent self-sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally could become inevitable because of substantial exportation of presymptomatic cases and in the absence of large-scale public health interventions.\n\n Preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be readied for quick deployment globally.\n\n\nFunding\nHealth and Medical Research Fund (Hong Kong, China).\n\n\n","id":"PMC7159271","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Joseph T","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kathy","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gabriel M","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1093/infdis/jiaa077","date":"2020-02-15","title":"A Familial Cluster of Infection Associated With the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Indicating Possible Person-to-Person Transmission During the Incubation Period","abstract":"An ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with 2019 novel coronavirus was reported in China.\n It is unclear whether the virus is infective exists during the incubation period, although person-to-person transmission has been reported elsewhere.\n We report the epidemiological features of a familial cluster of 4 patients in Shanghai, including an 88-year-old man with limited mobility who was exposed only to asymptomatic family members whose symptoms developed later.\n The epidemiological evidence has shown possible transmission of 2019 novel coronavirus during the incubation period.\n","id":"PMC7107453","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ping","surname":"Yu","email":"jxcdcyp@126.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiang","surname":"Zhu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhengdong","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yingjun","surname":"Han","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) cases in Hong Kong and implications for further spread","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"10.1016/j.jinf.2020.01.014","date":"2020-01-21","title":"Emergence of a novel coronavirus causing respiratory illness from Wuhan, China","abstract":"","id":"PMC7127306","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Julian W.","surname":"Tang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Paul A.","surname":"Tambyah","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"David S.C.","surname":"Hui","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Wuhan coronavirus outbreak.2 February 2020. https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/.","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Government of Hong Kong SAR.

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 3666 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 36 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 610 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome

novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension

patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar

characterisation and epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and

Cases exported domestically were then estimated.\n\n We forecasted the national and global spread of 2019-nCoV, accounting for the effect of the metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan and surrounding cities, which began Jan 2324, 2020. We used data on monthly flight bookings from the Official Aviation Guide and data on human mobility across more than 300 prefecture-level cities in mainland China from the Tencent database.\n\n Data on confirmed cases were obtained from the reports published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n Serial interval estimates were based on previous studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV).\n\n A susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered metapopulation model was used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China.\n\n The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credibile interval (CrI).\n\n\nFindings\nIn our baseline scenario, we estimated that the basic reproductive number for 2019-nCoV was 2·68 (95% CrI 2·472·86) and that 75?815 individuals (95% CrI 37?304130?330) have been infected in Wuhan as of Jan 25, 2020. The epidemic doubling time was 6·4 days (95% CrI 5·87·1).\n\n We estimated that in the baseline scenario, Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen had imported 461 (95% CrI 227805), 113 (57193), 98 (49168), 111 (56191), and 80 (40139) infections from Wuhan, respectively.\n\n If the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV were similar everywhere domestically and over time, we inferred that epidemics are already growing exponentially in multiple major cities of China with a lag time behind the Wuhan outbreak of about 12 weeks.\n\n\nInterpretation\nGiven that 2019-nCoV is no longer contained within Wuhan, other major Chinese cities are probably sustaining localised outbreaks.\n\n Large cities overseas with close transport links to China could also become outbreak epicentres, unless substantial public health interventions at both the population and personal levels are implemented immediately.\n\n Independent self-sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally could become inevitable because of substantial exportation of presymptomatic cases and in the absence of large-scale public health interventions.\n\n Preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be readied for quick deployment globally.\n\n\nFunding\nHealth and Medical Research Fund (Hong Kong, China).\n\n\n","id":"PMC7159271","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Joseph T","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kathy","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gabriel M","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1093/jtm/taaa011","date":"2020-01-27","title":"Potential for global spread of a novel coronavirus from China","abstract":"An epidemic of a novel coronavirus emerged from Wuhan, China, in late December 2019 and has since spread to several large Chinese cities.\n Should a scenario arise where this coronavirus spreads more broadly across China, we evaluate how patterns of international disease transmission could change.\n","id":"PMC7074660","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Isaac I","surname":"Bogoch","email":"isaac.bogoch@uhn.ca","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alexander","surname":"Watts","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Andrea","surname":"Thomas-Bachli","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Carmen","surname":"Huber","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Moritz U G","surname":"Kraemer","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kamran","surname":"Khan","email":"khank@smh.ca","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":".

observational study","abstract":"Background\nA range of public health measures have been implemented to suppress local transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hong Kong.\n\n We examined the effect of these interventions and behavioural changes of the public on the incidence of COVID-19, as well as on influenza virus infections, which might share some aspects of transmission dynamics with COVID-19.\nMethods\nWe analysed data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, influenza surveillance data in outpatients of all ages, and influenza hospitalisations in children.\n\n We estimated the daily effective reproduction number (Rt) for COVID-19 and influenza A H1N1 to estimate changes in transmissibility over time.\n\n Attitudes towards COVID-19 and changes in population behaviours were reviewed through three telephone surveys done on Jan 2023, Feb 1114, and March 1013, 2020.\nFindings\nCOVID-19 transmissibility measured by Rt has remained at approximately 1 for 8 weeks in Hong Kong.\n\n Influenza transmission declined substantially after the implementation of social distancing measures and changes in population behaviours in late January, with a 44% (95% CI 3453%) reduction in transmissibility in the community, from an estimated Rt of 1·28 (95% CI 1·261·30) before the start of the school closures to 0·72 (0·700·74) during the closure weeks.\n\n Similarly, a 33% (2443%) reduction in transmissibility was seen based on paediatric hospitalisation rates, from an Rt of 1·10 (1·061·12) before the start of the school closures to 0·73 (0·680·77) after school closures.\n\n Among respondents to the surveys, 74·5%, 97·5%, and 98·8% reported wearing masks when going out, and 61·3%, 90·2%, and 85·1% reported avoiding crowded places in surveys 1 (n=1008), 2 (n=1000), and 3 (n=1005), respectively.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur study shows that non-pharmaceutical interventions (including border restrictions, quarantine and isolation, distancing, and changes in population behaviour) were associated with reduced transmission of COVID-19 in Hong Kong, and are also likely to have substantially reduced influenza transmission in early February, 2020.\nFunding\nHealth and Medical Research Fund, Hong Kong.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7164922","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_elsevier_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Benjamin

related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in mainland China, outside Hubei provincethe epicentre of the outbreakhad been reported.\n\n Since late January, massive public health interventions have been implemented nationwide to contain the outbreak.\n\n We provide an impact assessment of the transmissibility and severity of COVID-19 during the first wave in mainland Chinese locations outside Hubei.\n\n\nMethods\nWe estimated the instantaneous reproduction number (Rt) of COVID-19 in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Wenzhou, and the ten Chinese provinces that had the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases; and the confirmed case-fatality risk (cCFR) in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Wenzhou, and all 31 Chinese provinces.\n\n We used a susceptibleinfectiousrecovered model to show the potential effects of relaxing containment measures after the first wave of infection, in anticipation of a possible second wave.\n\n\nFindings\nIn all selected cities and provinces, the Rt decreased substantially since Jan 23, when control measures were implemented, and have since remained below 1. The cCFR outside Hubei was 0·98% (95% CI 0·821·16), which was almost five times lower than that in Hubei (5·91%, 5·736·09).\n\n Relaxing the interventions (resulting in Rt &gt;1) when the epidemic size was still small would increase the cumulative case count exponentially as a function of relaxation duration, even if aggressive interventions could subsequently push disease prevalence back to the baseline level.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe first wave of COVID-19 outside of Hubei has abated because of aggressive non-pharmaceutical interventions.\n\n However, given the substantial risk of viral reintroduction, particularly from overseas importation, close monitoring of Rt and cCFR is needed to inform strategies against a potential second wave to achieve an optimal balance between health and economic protection.\n\n\nFunding\nHealth and Medical Research Fund, Hong Kong,

mathematical modelling study","abstract":"Background\nAn outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to 95?333 confirmed cases as of March 5, 2020. Understanding the early transmission dynamics of the infection and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures is crucial for assessing the potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas.\n\n Combining a mathematical model of severe SARS-CoV-2 transmission with four datasets from within and outside Wuhan, we estimated how transmission in Wuhan varied between December, 2019, and February, 2020. We used these estimates to assess the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission to occur in locations outside Wuhan if cases were introduced.\n\n\nMethods\nWe combined a stochastic transmission model with data on cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan and international cases that originated in Wuhan to estimate how transmission had varied over time during January, 2020, and February, 2020. Based on these estimates, we then calculated the probability that newly introduced cases might generate outbreaks in other areas.\n\n To estimate the early dynamics of transmission in Wuhan, we fitted a stochastic transmission dynamic model to multiple publicly available datasets on cases in Wuhan and internationally exported cases from Wuhan.\n\n The four datasets we fitted to were: daily number of new internationally exported cases (or lack thereof), by date of onset, as of Jan 26, 2020; daily number of new cases in Wuhan with no market exposure, by date of onset, between Dec 1, 2019, and Jan 1, 2020; daily number of new cases in China, by date of onset, between Dec 29, 2019, and Jan 23, 2020; and proportion of infected passengers on evacuation flights between Jan 29, 2020, and Feb 4, 2020. We used an additional two datasets for comparison with model outputs: daily number of new exported cases from Wuhan (or lack thereof) in countries with high connectivity to Wuhan (ie, top 20 most at-risk countries), by date of confirmation, as of Feb 10, 2020; and data on new confirmed cases reported in Wuhan between Jan 16, 2020, and Feb 11, 2020.\nFindings\nWe estimated that the median daily reproduction number (Rt) in Wuhan declined from 2·35 (95% CI 1·154·77) 1 week before travel restrictions were introduced on Jan 23, 2020, to 1·05 (0·412·39) 1 week after.\n\n Based on our estimates of Rt, assuming SARS-like variation, we calculated that in locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan in early January, once there are at least four independently introduced cases, there is a more than 50% chance the infection will establish within that population.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur results show that COVID-19 transmission probably declined in Wuhan during late January, 2020, coinciding with the introduction of travel control measures.\n\n As more cases arrive in international locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan before these control measures, it is likely many chains of transmission will fail to establish initially, but might lead to new outbreaks eventually.\n\n\nFunding\nWellcome Trust, Health Data Research UK, Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, and National Institute for Health Research.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7158569","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Adam J","surname":"Kucharski","email":"adam.kucharski@lshtm.ac.uk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Timothy W","surname":"Russell","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Charlie","surname":"Diamond","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"John","surname":"Edmunds","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sebastian","surname":"Funk","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rosalind M","surname":"Eggo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fiona","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mark","surname":"Jit","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"James D","surname":"Munday","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nicholas","surname":"Davies","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Amy","surname":"Gimma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kevin","surname":"van Zandvoort","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hamish","surname":"Gibbs","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Joel","surname":"Hellewell","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christopher I","surname":"Jarvis","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sam","surname":"Clifford","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Billy J","surname":"Quilty","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nikos I","surname":"Bosse","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sam","surname":"Abbott","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Petra","surname":"Klepac","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Stefan","surname":"Flasche","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1038/s41591-020-0822-7","date":"2020-03-09","title":"Estimating clinical severity of COVID-19 from the transmission dynamics in Wuhan, China","abstract":"id='Par2'>As of 29 February 2020 there were 79,394 confirmed cases and 2,838 deaths from COVID-19 in mainland China.\n Of these, 48,557 cases and 2,169 deaths occurred in the epicenter, Wuhan.\n A key public health priority during the emergence of a novel pathogen is estimating clinical severity, which requires properly adjusting for the case ascertainment rate and the delay between symptoms onset and death.\n Using public and published information, we estimate that the overall symptomatic case fatality risk (the probability of dying after developing symptoms) of COVID-19 in Wuhan was 1.4% (0.92.1%), which is substantially lower than both the corresponding crude or naïve confirmed case fatality risk (2,169/48,557?=?4.5%) and the approximator1 of deaths/deaths?+?recoveries (2,169/2,169?+?17,572?=?11%) as of 29 February 2020.

the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·058·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·013·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future
