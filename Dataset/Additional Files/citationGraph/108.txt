provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7092819","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Wei-jie","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng-yi","surname":"Ni","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng-yi","surname":"Ni","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yu","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wen-hua","surname":"Liang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chun-quan","surname":"Ou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jian-xing","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Shan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chun-liang","surname":"Lei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"David S.C.","surname":"Hui","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Du","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lan-juan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guang","surname":"Zeng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kwok-Yung","surname":"Yuen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ru-chong","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chun-li","surname":"Tang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tao","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ping-yan","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jie","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shi-yue","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jin-lin","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zi-jing","surname":"Liang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi-xiang","surname":"Peng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Li","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ya-hua","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Peng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jian-ming","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ji-yang","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhong","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gang","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhi-jian","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shao-qin","surname":"Qiu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jie","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chang-jiang","surname":"Ye","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shao-yong","surname":"Zhu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nan-shan","surname":"Zhong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1093/cid/ciaa199","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical Characteristics of Imported Cases of COVID-19 in Jiangsu Province: A Multicenter Descriptive Study","abstract":"Background\nWe aimed to report the clinical characteristics of imported coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) in Jiangsu Province.\n\n\nMethods\nWe retrospectively investigated the clinical, imaging, and laboratory characteristics of confirmed cases of COVID-19 with WHO interim guidance in three Grade ?A hospitals of Jiangsu from Jan 22 to Feb 14, 2020.

units (ICUs) worldwide.\n\n As the pandemic escalates, determining the resulting needs for healthcare resources (beds, staff, equipment) has become a key priority for many countries.\n\n Projecting future demand requires estimates of how long patients with COVID-19 need different levels of hospital care.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>We performed a systematic review of early evidence on length of stay (LoS) of patients with COVID-19 in hospital and in ICU.\n\n We subsequently developed a method to generate LoS distributions which combines summary statistics reported in multiple studies, accounting for differences in sample sizes.\n\n Applying this approach, we provide distributions for total hospital and ICU LoS from studies in China and elsewhere, for use by the community.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>We identified 52 studies, the majority from China (46/52).\n\n Median hospital LoS ranged from 4 to 53 days within China, and 4 to 21 days outside of China, across 45 studies.\n\n ICU LoS was reported by eight studies—four each within and outside China—with median values ranging from 6 to 12 and 4 to 19 days, respectively.\n\n Our summary distributions have a median hospital LoS of 14 (IQR 10–19) days for China, compared with 5 (IQR 3–9) days outside of China.\n\n For ICU, the summary distributions are more similar (median (IQR) of 8 (5–13) days for China and 7 (4–11) days outside of China).\n\n There was a visible difference by discharge status, with patients who were discharged alive having longer LoS than those who died during their admission, but no trend associated with study date.\n\n\nConclusion\nid='Par4'>Patients with COVID-19 in China appeared to remain in hospital for longer than elsewhere.\n\n This may be explained by differences in criteria for admission and discharge between countries, and different timing within the pandemic.\n\n In the absence of local data, the combined summary LoS distributions provided here can be used to model bed demands for contingency planning and then updated, with the novel method presented here, as more studies with aggregated statistics emerge outside

Comparisons between the viruses were made.\n\n\nResults\nInadequate risk assessment regarding the urgency of the situation, and limited reporting on the virus within China has, in part, led to the rapid spread of COVID-19 throughout mainland China and into proximal and distant countries.\n\n Compared with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has spread more rapidly, due in part to increased globalization and the focus of the epidemic.\n\n Wuhan, China is a large hub connecting the North, South, East and West of China via railways and a major international airport.\n\n The availability of connecting flights, the timing of the outbreak during the Chinese (Lunar) New Year, and the massive rail transit hub located in Wuhan has enabled the virus to perforate throughout China, and eventually, globally.\n\n\nConclusions\nWe conclude that we did not learn from the two prior epidemics of coronavirus and were ill-prepared to deal with the challenges the COVID-19 epidemic has posed.\n\n Future research should attempt to address the uses and implications of internet of things (IoT) technologies for mapping the spread of infection.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7197734","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Noah C","surname":"Peeri","email":"noah.peeri@my.unthsc.edu","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nistha","surname":"Shrestha","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nistha","surname":"Shrestha","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Md Siddikur","surname":"Rahman","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rafdzah","surname":"Zaki","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhengqi","surname":"Tan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Saana","surname":"Bibi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mahdi","surname":"Baghbanzadeh","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nasrin","surname":"Aghamohammadi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wenyi","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ubydul","surname":"Haque","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1002/eji.202070035","date":"1970-01-01","title":"COVID?19: Lessons from SARS and MERS","abstract":"","id":"PMC7163482","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Mirae","surname":"Park","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ryan S.","surname":"Thwaites","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Peter J.

associated with the duration of hospitalisation among COVID-19 patients in Vietnam: A survival analysis","abstract":"Background\nThe median duration of hospital stays due to COVID-19 has been reported in several studies on China as 10?13 days.\n\n Global studies have indicated that the length of hospitalisation depends on different factors, such as the time elapsed from exposure to symptom onset, and from symptom onset to hospital admission, as well as specificities of the country under study.\n\n The goal of this paper is to identify factors associated with the median duration of hospital stays of COVID-19 patients during the second COVID-19 wave that hit Vietnam from 5 March to 8 April 2020.\nMethod\nWe used retrospective data on 133 hospitalised patients with COVID-19 recorded over at least two weeks during the study period.\n\n The Cox proportional-hazards regression model was applied to determine the potential risk factors associated with length of hospital stay.\n\n\nResults\nThere were 65 (48.9%) females, 98 (73.7%) patients 48 years old or younger, 15 (11.3%) persons with comorbidities, 21 (16.0%) severely ill patients and 5 (3.8%) individuals with life-threatening conditions.\n\n Eighty-two (61.7%) patients were discharged after testing negative for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, 51 were still in the hospital at the end of the study period and none died.\n\n The median duration of stay in a hospital was 21 (IQR: 16–34) days.\n\n The multivariable Cox regression model showed that age, residence and sources of contamination were significantly associated with longer duration of hospitalisation.\n\n\nConclusion\nA close look at how long COVID-19 patients stayed in the hospital could provide an overview of their treatment process in Vietnam, and support the country's National Steering Committee on COVID-19 Prevention and Control in the efficient allocation of resources over the next stages of the COVID-19 prevention period.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7306545","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Pham Quang","surname":"Thai","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Do Thi

role and response of primary healthcare services in the delivery of palliative care in epidemics and pandemics: A rapid review to inform practice and service delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic","abstract":"Background:\nThe increased number of deaths in the community happening as a result of COVID-19 has caused primary healthcare services to change their traditional service delivery in a short timeframe.\n\n Services are quickly adapting to new challenges in the practical delivery of end-of-life care to patients in the community including through virtual consultations and in the provision of timely symptom control.\n\n\nAim:\nTo synthesise existing evidence related to the delivery of palliative and end-of-life care by primary healthcare professionals in epidemics and pandemics.\n\n\nDesign:\nRapid systematic review using modified systematic review methods, with narrative synthesis of the evidence.\n\n\nData sources:\nSearches were carried out in Medline, Embase, PsychINFO, CINAHL and Web of Science on 7th March 2020.\nResults:\nOnly five studies met the inclusion criteria, highlighting a striking lack of evidence base for the response of primary healthcare services in palliative care during epidemics and pandemics.\n\n All were observational studies.\n\n Findings were synthesised using a pandemic response framework according to ‘systems’ (community providers feeling disadvantaged in terms of receiving timely information and protocols), ‘space’ (recognised need for more care in the community), ‘staff’ (training needs and resilience) and ‘stuff’ (other aspects of managing care in pandemics including personal protective equipment, cleaning care settings and access to investigations).\n\n\nConclusions:\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic progresses, there is an urgent need for research to provide increased understanding of the role of primary care and community nursing services in palliative care, alongside hospices and community specialist palliative care providers.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7528540","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Sarah","surname":"Mitchell","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Victoria","surname":"Maynard","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Victoria","surname":"Maynard","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Victoria","surname":"Lyons","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nicholas","surname":"Jones","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Clare","surname":"Gardiner","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1370/afm.2557","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Redesigning

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and

SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in

strains of influenza have emerged to produce human pandemics, causing widespread illness, death, and disruption.\n There have been four influenza pandemics in the past hundred years.\n During this time, globalization processes, alongside advances in medicine and epidemiology, have altered the way these pandemics are experienced.\n Drawing on international case studies, this paper provides a review of the impact of past influenza pandemics, while examining the evolution of our understanding of, and response to, these viruses.\n This review argues that pandemic influenza is in part a consequence of human development, and highlights the importance of considering outbreaks within the context of shifting global landscapes.\n While progress in infectious disease prevention, control, and treatment has improved our ability to respond to such outbreaks, globalization processes relating to human behaviour, demographics, and mobility have increased the threat of pandemic emergence and accelerated global disease transmission.\n Preparedness planning must continue to evolve to keep pace with this heightened risk.\n Herein, we look to the past for insights on the pandemic experience, underlining both progress and persisting challenges.\n However, given the uncertain timing and severity of future pandemics, we emphasize the need for flexible policies capable of responding to change

traits, we predict global viral sharing patterns of 4196 mammal species and show that our simulated network successfully predicts viral sharing and reservoir host status using internal validation and

attempts in children with type 1 diabetes and their healthy siblings.\n\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\nWe performed a population-based case-cohort study of individuals born in Sweden between 1973 and 2009. Children with type 1 diabetes (n = 17,122) and their healthy siblings (n = 18,847) were identified and followed until their 18th birthday.\n\n Their risk of psychiatric disorders was compared with that of matched control subjects.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe risk of psychiatric morbidity in children with type 1 diabetes compared with the general population was tripled within 6 months after the onset of diabetes (hazard ratio [HR] 3.0 [95% CI 2.7–3.4]) and doubled within the total observation period (HR 2.1 [95% CI 2.0–2.2]).\n\n An increased risk was noted in suicide attempts (HR 1.7 [95% CI 1.4–2.0]) and in most categories of psychiatric disorders.\n\n The risk of psychiatric disorders in probands declined from HR 2.7 (95% CI 2.2–3.3) for those in the cohort born 1973–1986 to 1.9 (95% CI 1.8–2.0) in those born 1997–2009. The risk for any psychiatric disorders among siblings of patients with type 1 diabetes was estimated to be HR 1.1 (95% CI 1.0–1.1), and there was no increased risk in any of the specific category of disorders.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nChildren with type 1 diabetes are at high risk of psychiatric disorders, which seems to be a consequence of the disease rather than due to a common familial etiology.\n\n The results support recommendations on comprehensive mental health surveillance in children with type 1 diabetes, especially in recently diagnosed children.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4338504","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Agnieszka","surname":"Butwicka","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Louise","surname":"Frisén","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Catarina","surname":"Almqvist","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Björn","surname":"Zethelius","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Paul","surname":"Lichtenstein","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1111/ijcp.13716","date":"2020-09-11","title":"Telepsychiatry

(PAI) is significantly increased, with respiratory infections as a major cause of death.\n\n Moreover, patients with PAI report an increased rate of non-fatal infections.\n\n Neutrophils and natural killer (NK) cells are innate immune cells that provide frontline protection against invading pathogens.\n\n Thus, we compared the function and phenotype of NK cells and neutrophils isolated from PAI patients and healthy controls to ascertain whether altered innate immune responses could be a contributory factor for the increased susceptibility of PAI patients to infection.\n\n\nDesign and methods\nWe undertook a cross-sectional study of 42 patients with PAI due to autoimmune adrenalitis (n?=?37) or bilateral adrenalectomy (n?=?5) and 58 sex- and age-matched controls.\n\n A comprehensive screen of innate immune function, consisting of measurements of neutrophil phagocytosis, reactive oxygen species production, NK cell cytotoxicity (NKCC) and NK cell surface receptor expression, was performed on all subjects.\n\n\nResults\nNeutrophil function did not differ between PAI and controls.\n\n However, NKCC was significantly reduced in PAI (12.0?±?1.5% vs 21.1?±?2.6%, P?&lt;?0.0001).\n\n Phenotypically, the percentage of NK cells expressing the activating receptors NKG2D and NKp46 was significantly lower in PAI, as was the surface density of NKG2D (all P?&lt;?0.0001).\n\n Intracellular granzyme B expression was significantly increased in NK cells from PAI patients (P?&lt;?0.01).\n\n\nConclusions\nAdrenal insufficiency is associated with significantly decreased NKCC, thereby potentially compromising early recognition and elimination of virally infected cells.\n\n This potential impairment in anti-viral immune defense may contribute to the increased rate of respiratory infections and ultimately mortality in PAI.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5425935","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Irina","surname":"Bancos","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jon","surname":"Hazeldine","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Vasileios","surname":"Chortis","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Peter","surname":"Hampson","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Angela

clinical course of multiple sclerosis","abstract":"Accurate clinical course descriptions (phenotypes) of multiple sclerosis (MS) are important for communication, prognostication, design and recruitment of clinical trials, and treatment decision-making.\n Standardized descriptions published in 1996 based on a survey of international MS experts provided purely clinical phenotypes based on data and consensus at that time, but imaging and biological correlates were lacking.\n Increased understanding of MS and its pathology, coupled with general concern that the original descriptors may not adequately reflect more recently identified clinical aspects of the disease, prompted a re-examination of MS disease phenotypes by the International Advisory Committee on Clinical Trials of MS.\n While imaging and biological markers that might provide objective criteria for separating clinical phenotypes are lacking, we propose refined descriptors that include consideration of disease activity (based on clinical relapse rate and imaging findings) and disease progression.\n Strategies for future research to better define phenotypes are also outlined.\n","id":"PMC4117366","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Fred D.","surname":"Lublin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Stephen

studies.\n\n\nMethods:\nWe searched the PubMed, PsychInfo, SCOPUS, and Web of Knowledge databases and reference lists of retrieved articles.\n\n Abstracts were screened for relevance by two independent reviewers, followed by full-text review.\n\n Data were abstracted by one reviewer, and verified by a second reviewer.\n\n Study quality was evaluated using a standardized tool.\n\n For population-based studies we assessed heterogeneity quantitatively using the I2 statistic, and conducted meta-analyses.\n\n\nResults:\nWe included 118 studies in this review.\n\n Among population-based studies, the prevalence of anxiety was 21.9% (95% CI: 8.76%–35.0%), while it was 14.8% for alcohol abuse, 5.83% for bipolar disorder, 23.7% (95% CI: 17.4%–30.0%) for depression, 2.5% for substance

Related to the Induction of Headache and Flu-Like Pain Symptoms: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomised Controlled Trials","abstract":"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurodegenerative, inflammatory, and autoimmune disease characterised by the demyelination of the central nervous system.\n One of the main approaches for treating MS is the use of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs).\n Among the DMTs are interferons (IFNs), which are cytokines responsible for controlling the activity of the immune system while exerting immunomodulatory, antiviral, and antiproliferative activities.\n IFN-beta (IFN-?) is the first-choice drug used to treat relapsing-remitting MS.\n However, the administration of IFN-? causes numerous painful adverse effects, resulting in lower adherence to the treatment.\n Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the headache and flu-like pain symptoms observed after IFN? injection in MS patients using a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.\n A total of 2370 articles were identified through research databases.\n Nine articles were included (three involving IFN?-1b and six involving IFN?-1a).\n All studies included in the meta-analysis had a low risk of bias.\n The odds ratio of headache and flu-like pain symptoms increased in MS patients treated with IFN-?.\n Thus, the adverse effects of headache and flu-like pain symptoms appear to be linked to IFN-? treatment in MS.\n The protocol of the study was registered in the Prospective International Registry of Systematic

Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis","abstract":"Multiple sclerosis is a chronic immune mediated demyelinating disease leading to neurological disabilities that need to be diagnosed and treated early.\n Guidelines on multiple sclerosis diagnosis and monitoring experienced comprehensive changes over the last decades.\n The first McDonald criteria published in 2001 emphasized the importance of MR imaging but also recognized the role of cerebrospinal fluid diagnostics.\n The demonstration of an intrathecal immunoglobulin G synthesis is a well-established additional component and has a long tradition in the diagnosis of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.\n However, the role of cerebrospinal fluid for diagnostic purposes was rather diminished in each revision of the McDonald criteria.\n In the latest revision of the McDonald criteria of 2017, the detection of an intrathecal immunoglobulin G synthesis as oligoclonal bands experienced a revival.\n Patients with the first clinical event suggesting multiple sclerosis who fulfill the criteria for dissemination in space can be diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis when oligoclonal bands in cerebrospinal fluid are detected.\n The diagnostic sensitivity of these novel criteria with a focus on dissemination in time and oligoclonal bands as a substitute for dissemination in time was published in different cohorts in the last year and is of special interest in this review.\n Recently published data show that by applying the 2017 McDonald criteria, multiple sclerosis can be diagnosed more frequently at the time of first clinical event as compared to the 2010 McDonald criteria.\n The main effect was due to the implementation of oligoclonal bands as a substitute for dissemination in time.\n However, careful differential diagnosis is essential in patients with atypical clinical manifestations to avoid misdiagnoses.\n","id":"PMC6428717","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Philipp","surname":"Schwenkenbecher","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ulrich","surname":"Wurster","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Franz

2018).\n\n\nReview methods\nEligible datasets included HADS-D scores and major depression status based on a validated diagnostic interview.\n\n Primary study data and study level data extracted from primary reports were combined.\n\n For HADS-D cut-off thresholds of 5-15, a bivariate random effects meta-analysis was used to estimate pooled sensitivity and specificity, separately, in studies that used semi-structured diagnostic interviews (eg, Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders), fully structured interviews (eg, Composite International Diagnostic Interview), and the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview.\n\n One stage meta-regression was used to examine whether accuracy was associated with reference standard categories and the characteristics of participants.\n\n Sensitivity analyses were done to assess whether including published results from studies that did not provide raw data influenced the results.\n\n\nResults\nIndividual participant data were obtained from 101 of 168 eligible studies (60%; 25?574 participants (72% of eligible participants), 2549 with major depression).\n\n Combined

Among studies with a semi-structured interview (57 studies, 10?664 participants, 1048 with major depression), sensitivity and specificity were 0.82 (95% confidence interval 0.76 to 0.87) and 0.78

screening for major depression, a HADS-D cut-off value of seven or higher maximised combined sensitivity and specificity.\n\n A cut-off value of eight or higher generated similar combined sensitivity and specificity but was less sensitive and more specific.\n\n To identify medically ill patients with depression with the HADS-D, lower cut-off values could be used to avoid false negatives and higher

Neurons of the Dorsal Root Ganglia Become Hyperexcitable in a T-Cell-Mediated MOG-EAE Model of Multiple Sclerosis","abstract":"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system.\n Patients with MS typically present with visual, motor, and sensory deficits.\n However, an additional complication of MS in large subset of patients is neuropathic pain.\n To study the underlying immune-mediated pathophysiology of pain in MS we employed the myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-induced experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) model in mice.\n Since sensory neurons are crucial for nociceptive transduction, we investigated the effect of this disease on sensory neurons of the lumbar dorsal root ganglia (DRG).\n Here, we report the disease was associated with activation of the complement system and the NLRP3 inflammasome in the DRG.\n We further observe a transient increase in the number of complement component 5a receptor 1-positive (C5aR1+) immune cells, CD4+ T-cells, and Iba1+ macrophages in the DRG.\n The absence of any significant change in the levels of mRNA for myelin proteins in the DRG and the sciatic nerve suggests that demyelination in the PNS is not a trigger for the immune response in the DRG.\n However, we did observe an induction of activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) at disease onset and chronic disruption of cytoskeletal proteins in the DRG demonstrating neuronal injury in the PNS in response to the disease.\n Electrophysiological analysis revealed the emergence of hyperexcitability in medium-to-large (?26 µm) diameter neurons, especially at the onset of MOG-EAE signs.\n These results provide conclusive evidence of immune activation, neuronal injury, and peripheral sensitization in MOG-EAE, a model classically considered to be centrally mediated.\n","id":"PMC6449162","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Muhammad

March 2020 to 2766 participants.\n Multivariate ordinal logistic regression models were constructed to examine the associations between sociodemographic variables; personality traits; depression, anxiety, and stress.\n Female gender, negative affect, and detachment were associated with higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress.\n Having an acquaintance infected was associated with increased levels of both depression and stress, whereas a history of stressful situations and medical problems was associated with higher levels of depression and anxiety.\n Finally, those with a family member infected and young person who had to work outside their domicile presented higher levels of anxiety and stress, respectively.\n This epidemiological picture is an important benchmark for identifying persons at greater risk of suffering from psychological distress and the results are useful for tailoring psychological interventions targeting the post-traumatic nature of the

Syndrome","abstract":"OBJECTIVES\nIsolation due to the management of infectious diseases is thought to affect mental health, but the effects are still unknown.\n\n We examined the prevalence of anxiety symptoms and anger in persons isolated during the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) epidemic both at isolation period and at four to six months after release from isolation.\n\n We also determined risk factors associated with these symptoms at four to six months.\n\n\nMETHODS\nOf 14,992 individuals isolated for 2-week due to having contact with MERS patients in 2015, when MERS was introduced to Korea, 1,692 individuals were included in this study.\n\n Anxiety symptoms were evaluated with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale and anger was assessed with the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory at four to six months after release from isolation for MERS.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf 1,692 who came in contact with MERS patients, 1,656 were not diagnosed with MERS.\n\n Among 1,656, anxiety symptoms showed 7.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.3 to 8.9%) and feelings of anger were present in 16.6% (95% CI, 14.8 to 18.4%) during the isolation period.\n\n At four to six months after release from isolation, anxiety symptoms were observed in 3.0% (95%CI, 2.2 to 3.9%).\n\n Feelings of anger were present in 6.4% (95% CI, 5.2 to 7.6%).\n\n Risk factors for experiencing anxiety symptoms and anger at four to six months after release included symptoms related to MERS during isolation, inadequate supplies (food, clothes, accommodation), social networking activities (email, text, Internet), history of psychiatric illnesses, and financial loss.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMental health problems at four to six month after release from isolation might be prevented by providing mental health support to individuals with vulnerable mental health, and providing accurate information as well as appropriate supplies, including food, clothes, and accommodation.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5177805","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Hyunsuk","surname":"Jeong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hyeon

society, including mental health and physical health.\n We explore the psychological, social, and neuroscientific effects of COVID-19 and set out the immediate priorities and longer-term strategies for mental health science research.\n These priorities were informed by surveys of the public and an expert panel convened by the UK Academy of Medical Sciences and the mental health research charity, MQ: Transforming Mental Health, in the first weeks of the pandemic in the UK in March, 2020. We urge UK research funding agencies to work with researchers, people with lived experience, and others to establish a high level coordination group to ensure that these research priorities are addressed, and to allow new ones to be identified over time.\n The need to maintain high-quality research standards is imperative.\n International collaboration and a global perspective will be beneficial.\n An immediate priority is collecting high-quality data on the mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic across the whole population and vulnerable groups, and on brain function, cognition, and mental health of patients with COVID-19. There is an urgent need for research to address how mental health consequences for vulnerable groups can be mitigated under pandemic conditions, and on the impact of repeated media consumption and health messaging around COVID-19. Discovery, evaluation, and refinement of mechanistically driven interventions to address the psychological, social, and neuroscientific aspects of the pandemic are required.\n Rising to this challenge will require integration across disciplines and sectors, and should be done together with people with lived experience.\n New funding will be required to meet these priorities, and it can be efficiently leveraged by the UK's world-leading infrastructure.\n This Position Paper provides a strategy that may be both adapted for, and integrated with, research efforts in other countries.\n","id":"PMC7159850","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Emily A","surname":"Holmes","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rory C","surname":"O'Connor","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"V Hugh","surname":"Perry","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Irene","surname":"Tracey","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Simon","surname":"Wessely","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Louise","surname":"Arseneault","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Clive","surname":"Ballard","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Helen","surname":"Christensen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Roxane","surname":"Cohen Silver","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ian","surname":"Everall","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tamsin","surname":"Ford","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ann","surname":"John","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Thomas","surname":"Kabir","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kate","surname":"King","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ira","surname":"Madan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Susan","surname":"Michie","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Andrew K","surname":"Przybylski","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Roz","surname":"Shafran","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Angela","surname":"Sweeney","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Carol M","surname":"Worthman","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lucy","surname":"Yardley","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Katherine","surname":"Cowan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Claire","surname":"Cope","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Matthew","surname":"Hotopf","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ed","surname":"Bullmore","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.3390/ijerph17051729","date":"2020-03-03","title":"Immediate Psychological Responses and Associated Factors during the Initial Stage of the 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Epidemic among the General Population in China","abstract":"Background: The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic is a public health emergency of international concern and poses a challenge to psychological resilience.\n Research data are needed to develop evidence-driven strategies to reduce adverse psychological impacts and psychiatric symptoms during the epidemic.\n The aim of this study was to survey the general public in China to better understand their levels of psychological impact, anxiety, depression, and stress during the initial stage of the COVID-19 outbreak.\n The data will be used for future reference.\n Methods: From 31 January to 2 February 2020, we conducted an online survey using snowball sampling techniques.\n The online survey collected information on demographic data, physical symptoms in the past 14 days, contact history with COVID-19, knowledge and concerns about COVID-19, precautionary measures against COVID-19, and additional information required with respect to COVID-19.

arithmetic control condition to 56 undergraduate students scoring in the low normal range on a measure of chronic worry.\n The worry induction was associated with faster responses than arithmetic to probes in the attended location following threat words, indicating the combined influence of worry and threat in facilitating attention.\n Within the worry condition, responses to probes in the attended location were faster for trials containing threat words than for trials with only neutral words, whereas the converse pattern was observed for responses to probes in the unattended location.\n This connection between worry states and attentional capture by threat may be central to understanding the impact of hypervigilance on information processing in anxiety and its

outpatient clinic of a University Hospital in Singapore.\n Participants were administered questionnaires on smoking attitudes and perceptions, psychiatric symptoms, and respiratory symptoms.\n Correlations and multiple regression analyses were conducted.\n The mean age of smokers in the study was 35.32 ± 13.05 years.\n Smokers in the community and psychiatric samples were largely similar on all of the sociodemographic factors, except that fewer depressed people were employed (?2 = 8.35, p &lt; 0.01).\n Smokers with depression also reported more attempts to quit smoking (?2 = 7.14, p &lt;

during this outbreak.\n\n\nMethods\nData were collected using an online survey, with a link directed to the affected population via a number of industry groups.\n\n Psychological distress, as determined by the Kessler 10 Psychological Distress Scale, was the main outcome measure.\n\n\nResults\nIn total, 2760 people participated in this study.\n\n Extremely high levels of non-specific psychological distress were reported by respondents in this study, with 34% reporting high psychological distress (K10 &gt; 22), compared to levels of around 12% in the Australian general

prevalence of high psychological distress was greater in infected EI zones and States, elevated levels of psychological distress were experienced in horse-owners nationally.\n\n Statistical analysis indicated that certain groups were more vulnerable to high psychological distress; specifically younger people, and those with lower levels of formal educational qualifications.\n\n Respondents whose

one of the common symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS) and is often underdiagnosed, especially in women.\n\n Relapsing?remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) is the most widespread form of the disease, but the data on SD occurrence in this particular group of patients is limited.\n\n The aim of the study was to analyze the associations between demographic factors, symptoms and signs of MS, psychiatric comorbidities and SD in female patients with RRMS.\n\n\nMaterial &amp; Methods\nA subgroup of 86 sexually active women with RRMS out of 218 total MS respondents was analyzed.\n\n Exclusion criteria included active relapse, EDSS score equal or higher than 6.5, and current pregnancy.\n\n All patients completed questionnaires including demographic data, questions about symptoms and signs of MS, Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) for sexual performance, Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ?9) for depression, and Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) for fatigue evaluation.\n\n\nResults\nAccording to FSFI, SD occurred in 21 (27.27%) of the respondents.\n\n SD occurrence was associated with depression (p &lt; .\n\n05) and speech disturbances (p &lt; .\n\n04).\n\n A negative effect on sexual performance was associated with depression intensity (p &lt; .\n\n003), fatigue intensity (p &lt; .\n\n05), more advanced age at diagnosis (p &lt; .\n\n02), lower education level (p &lt; .\n\n05), and smaller area of residence (p &lt; .\n\n002).\n\n\nConclusions\n\nSD in women with RRMS is mostly associated with psychosocial parameters.\n\n Patients who are more depressed, presenting speech problems, less educated, and from smaller towns, should be considered high?risk for sexual

demographic, disease and lifestyle characteristics: an international cross-sectional study","abstract":"Background\nSexual dysfunction (SD) is very common in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) and contributes a significant burden of disease, particularly for young people.\n\n SD has direct neurological contributions from depression and fatigue, which occur commonly in PwMS.\n\n Modifiable factors may represent potential targets for treatment and prevention of SD.\n\n We aimed to assess the prevalence of SD and explore associations between SD and demographic and modifiable risk factors, as well as depression and fatigue in a large cohort of PwMS.\n\n\nMethods\nWe analysed self-reported data from a large, international sample of PwMS recruited via Web 2.0 platforms, including demographic, lifestyle and disease characteristics.\n\n Specific sexual function questions included 4 items from the sexual function scale and 1 item regarding satisfaction with sexual function, part of the MS Quality of Life-54 instrument.\n\n\nResults\n2062 PwMS from 54 countries completed questions on sexual function.\n\n 81.1 % were women, mean age was 45 years, most (62.8 %) reported having relapsing-remitting MS.\n\n The majority (54.5 %) reported one or more problems with sexual function and were classified as having SD.\n\n Lack of sexual interest (41.8 % of women), and difficulty with erection (40.7 % of men) were most common.\n\n The median total sexual function score was 75.0 out of 100, and 43.7 % were satisfied with their sexual function.\n\n Regression modeling revealed independent associations between sexual function and satisfaction and a range of demographic factors, including age, as well as depression risk, antidepressant use, and fatigue in PwMS.\n\n\nConclusion\nThis cross-sectional study shows that SD and lack of satisfaction with sexual function are associated with depression risk and fatigue, as well as modifiable lifestyle factors diet and physical activity (after adjusting for depression and fatigue).\n\n Planned longitudinal follow-up of this sample may help clarify these associations and the underlying mechanisms.\n\n There is potential to prevent and treat SD in PwMS by addressing depression and fatigue and their determinants.\n\n Clinicians and PwMS should be aware of SD and associated factors as part of a comprehensive preventive approach to managing MS.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5097380","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Claudia

As per PSQI scores, two (1.4%) of the patients had good sleep, 16 (11.3%) had moderate sleep and 123 (87.2%) had poor sleep.\n\n There was a significant high positive correlation between the quality of mental and physical health composite scores (r = 0.791, P&lt;0.001).\n\n There was a significant negative correlation between the quality of physical score and age (r = -0.88, P&lt;0.001), fatigue score (r = -0.640, P&lt;0.001), EDSS score (r = -0.476, P&lt;0.001) and PSQI (sleep quality r = -0.514, P&lt;0.000).\n\n Linear regression analysis showed that PSQI score, EDSS, and fatigue score were predictors in the model between the quality of physical score and covariates (P&lt;0.001).\n\n Linear regression model showed that fatigue score and PSQI were predictors in the model between the quality of mental score and covariates (P&lt;0.001).\n\n\nDiscussion and Conclusion:\nIn conclusion, it may be said that MS patients had poor and moderate quality of mental and physical health.\n\n The quality of life was impaired as seen by PSQI, EDSS, and FSS.\n\n It is our suggestion that these patients require the attention of health care professionals, to be observed for the need of possible psychological support.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2771987","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Haleh","surname":"Ghaem","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Afshin Borhani","surname":"Haghighi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Quality of life in multiple sclerosis (MS) and role of fatigue, depression, anxiety, and stress: a bicenter study from north of Iran","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The effects of progressive muscle Relaxation on Depression, Anxiety and Stress in multiple sclerosis patients","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1212/WNL.33.11.1444","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Rating neurologic impairment in multiple sclerosis: an expanded disability status scale (EDSS)","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1007/s11195-013-9293-9","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Prevalence of Sexual Dysfunctions Among Women with Multiple Sclerosis","abstract":"Sexual concerns are known to be common in women suffering from multiple sclerosis (MS) but definite data on the prevalence of particular sexual dysfunctions (SD) remain unclear.\n Previous studies brought inconsistent findings and rely on small groups of patients or use of unvalidated assessment methods.\n The aim of this research was to evaluate the prevalence of SD in women with MS using validated clinimetric scales.\n 137 female inpatients with MS diagnosis were interviewed, completed The Female Sexual Function Questionnaire SFQ28 and underwent neurological assessment.\n Only 2.2 % of patients had ever discussed their sexual concerns with a physician.\n 70.1 % reported sexual activity.\n At least one SD could be found in 82.5 % of patients, hypoactive sexual desire (57.7 %), arousal dysfunction (decreased genital sensation in 47.3 %, decreased lubrication in 48.4 %, decreased subjective arousal in 45.2 %) and orgasmic dysfunction (39.8 %) being the most probable.\n SD were less likely in women who assessed their relationship positively but more common in older patients and those who had a positive history of depression.\n The prevalence of SD was higher comparing to the majority of studies by other authors.\n In conclusion, SD are very common in female patients with MS and permanently overlooked by medical professionals.\n Therefore, the assessment of sexual function should be implemented in all patients after the diagnosis of MS.\n Further research is needed for better understanding of the sexuality of this particular population in order to establish targets for therapeutic intervention.\n","id":"PMC3659270","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"M.","surname":"Lew-Starowicz","email":"michallew-starowicz@wp.pl","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"R.","surname":"Rola","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Sexual dysfunction in women with multiple sclerosis: dimensions and contributory factors","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Ghasemi V, Simbar M, Ozgoli G, Nabavi SM, Majd HA, Souri BM, Fakari FR, Naz MS.

Disability and Disease Course in Multiple Sclerosis Patients: An Italian Multi-Center Study Using the Beck Depression Inventory","abstract":"Background\nDepression occurs in about 50% of patients with multiple sclerosis.\n\n The aims of this study was to investigate the prevalence of depressive symptoms in a multicenter MS population using the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI II) and to identify possible correlations between the BDI II score and demographic and clinical variables.\n\n\nMethods\nData were collected in a multi-center, cross-sectional study over a period of six months in six MS centers in Italy using BDI II.\n\n\nResults\n1,011 MS patients participated in the study.\n\n 676 subjects were female, with a mean age of 34 years (SD 10.8), mean EDSS of 3.3 (0–8.5) and mean disease duration of 10.3 years (range 1–50 years).\n\n 668 (%) subjects scored lower than 14 on the BDI II and 343 (33.9%) scored greater than 14 (14 cut-off score).\n\n For patients with BDI&gt;14 multivariate analysis showed a significant difference between EDSS and disease course.\n\n BDI II scores for subjects with secondary progressive (SP) MS were significantly different from primary progressive (PP) patients (p &lt; 0.001) but similar to relapsing-remitting (RR) patients.\n\n Considering subjects with moderate to severe depressive symptoms (BDI II score from 20–63), in relation to disease course, 11.7% (83/710) had RR MS, 40.7% (96/236) SP and 13.6% (6/44) PP.\n\n\nConclusions\nUsing the BDI II, 30% of the current sample had depressive symptoms.\n\n BDI II score correlates with disability and disease course, particularly in subjects with SP MS.\n\n The BDI II scale can be a useful tool in clinical practice to screen depressive symptoms in people with MS.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5025048","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"C.","surname":"Solaro","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"E.","surname":"Trabucco","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"A.","surname":"Signori","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"V.","surname":"Martinelli","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"M.","surname":"Radaelli","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"D.","surname":"Centonze","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"S.","surname":"Rossi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"M.

immune responses that lead to damage of myelin.\n In this respect, intrinsic or extrinsic factors such as emotional, psychological, traumatic, or inflammatory stress as well as a variety of other lifestyle interventions can influence the neuroendocrine system.\n On its turn, it has been demonstrated that the neuroendocrine system has immunomodulatory potential.\n Moreover, the neuroendocrine and immune systems communicate bidirectionally via shared receptors and shared messenger molecules, variously called hormones, neurotransmitters, or cytokines.\n Discrepancies at any level can therefore lead to changes in susceptibility and to severity of several autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.\n Here we provide an overview of the complex system of crosstalk between the neuroendocrine and immune system as well as reported dysfunctions involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity, including MS.\n Finally, possible strategies to intervene with the neuroendocrine-immune system for MS patient management will be discussed.\n Ultimately, a better understanding of the interactions between the neuroendocrine system and the immune system can open up new therapeutic approaches for the treatment of MS as well as other autoimmune diseases.\n","id":"PMC3870621","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Nathalie","surname":"Deckx","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wai-Ping","surname":"Lee","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Wai-Ping","surname":"Lee","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zwi

sclerosis (MS).\n\n\nObjectives:\nThe objectives of this review are to estimate the incidence and prevalence of selected comorbid psychiatric disorders in MS and evaluate the quality of included studies.\n\n\nMethods:\nWe searched the PubMed, PsychInfo, SCOPUS, and Web of Knowledge databases and reference lists of retrieved articles.\n\n Abstracts were screened for relevance by two independent reviewers, followed by full-text review.\n\n Data were abstracted by one reviewer, and verified by a second reviewer.\n\n Study quality was evaluated using a standardized tool.\n\n For population-based studies we assessed heterogeneity quantitatively using the I2 statistic, and conducted meta-analyses.\n\n\nResults:\nWe included 118 studies in this review.\n\n Among population-based studies, the prevalence of anxiety was 21.9% (95% CI: 8.76%–35.0%), while it was 14.8% for alcohol abuse, 5.83% for bipolar disorder, 23.7% (95% CI: 17.4%–30.0%) for depression, 2.5% for substance abuse, and 4.3% (95% CI: 0%–10.3%) for psychosis.\n\n\nConclusion:\nThis review confirms that psychiatric comorbidity, particularly depression and anxiety, is common in MS.\n\n However, the incidence of psychiatric comorbidity remains understudied.\n\n Future comparisons across studies would be enhanced by developing a consistent approach to measuring psychiatric comorbidity, and reporting of age-, sex-, and ethnicity-specific estimates.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4429164","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ruth

study, we investigated the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on stroke care across China.\n\n\nMethods:\nData from the Big Data Observatory Platform for Stroke of China consisting of 280 hospitals across China demonstrated a significant drop in the number of cases of thrombolysis and thrombectomy.\n\n We designed a survey to investigate the major changes during the COVID-19 outbreak and potential causes of these changes.\n\n The survey was distributed to the leaders of stroke centers in these 280 hospitals.\n\n\nResults:\nFrom the data of Big Data Observatory Platform for Stroke of China, the total number of thrombolysis and thrombectomy cases dropped 26.7% (P&lt;0.0001) and 25.3% (P&lt;0.0001), respectively, in February 2020 as compared with February 2019. We retrieved 227 valid complete datasets from the 280 stroke centers.\n\n Nearly 50% of these hospitals were designated hospitals for COVID-19. The capacity for stroke care was reduced in the majority of the hospitals.\n\n Most of the stroke centers stopped or reduced their efforts in stroke education for the public.\n\n Hospital admissions related to stroke dropped ?40%; thrombolysis and thrombectomy cases dropped ?25%, which is similar to the results from the Big Data Observatory Platform for Stroke of China as compared with the same period in 2019. Many factors contributed to the reduced admissions and prehospital delays; lack of stroke knowledge and proper transportation were significant limiting factors.\n\n Patients not coming to the hospital for fear of virus infection was also a likely key factor.\n\n\nConclusions:\nThe COVID-19 outbreak impacted stroke care significantly in China, including prehospital and in-hospital care, resulting in a significant drop in admissions, thrombolysis, and thrombectomy.\n\n Although many factors contributed, patients not coming to the hospital was probably the major limiting factor.\n\n Recommendations based on the data are provided.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7258753","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":" Hang","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" David","surname":"Kung","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Marc","surname":"Fisher","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":" Ying","surname":"Shen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"                           Renyu","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}],"References depth 1":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Challenges and potential solutions of stroke care during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak.","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical characteristics of 138 hospitalized patients with 2019 novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia in Wuhan, China.","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Initiation of a new infection control system for the covid-19 outbreak.","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Early transmission dynamics in Wuhan, China, of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia.","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Impact and sustainability of centralising acute stroke services in english metropolitan areas: retrospective analysis of hospital episode statistics and stroke national audit data.","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Does size matter?

In each dataset, we determined the 3-year cumulative prevalence overall and stratified by age, sex, and census region.\n\n We applied insurance-specific and stratum-specific estimates to the 2010 US Census data and pooled the findings to calculate the 2010 prevalence of MS in the United States cumulated over 3 years.\n\n We also estimated the 2010 prevalence cumulated over 10 years using 2 models and extrapolated our estimate to 2017.\nResults\nThe estimated 2010 prevalence of MS in the US adult population cumulated over 10 years was 309.2 per 100,000 (95% confidence interval [CI] 308.1–310.1), representing 727,344 cases.\n\n During the same time period, the MS prevalence was 450.1 per 100,000 (95% CI 448.1–451.6) for women and 159.7 (95% CI 158.7–160.6) for men (female:male ratio 2.8).\n\n The estimated 2010 prevalence of MS was highest in the 55- to 64-year age group.\n\n A US north-south decreasing prevalence gradient was identified.\n\n The estimated MS prevalence is also presented for 2017.\nConclusion\nThe estimated US national MS prevalence for 2010 is the highest reported to date and provides evidence that the north-south gradient persists.\n\n Our rigorous algorithm-based approach to estimating prevalence is efficient and has the potential to be used for other chronic neurologic conditions.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6442006","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Mitchell T.","surname":"Wallin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"William J.","surname":"Culpepper","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jonathan D.","surname":"Campbell","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lorene M.","surname":"Nelson","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Annette","surname":"Langer-Gould","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ruth Ann","surname":"Marrie","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gary R.","surname":"Cutter","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wendy E.","surname":"Kaye","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Laurie","surname":"Wagner","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Helen","surname":"Tremlett","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Stephen L.","surname":"Buka","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Piyameth","surname":"Dilokthornsakul","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Barbara","surname":"Topol","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lie H.","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nicholas G.","surname":"LaRocca","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}],"References depth 2":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Statistics Canada.

study","abstract":"Purpose\nTreatment adherence is a prerequisite for treatment success and therefore an important consideration to assure that therapeutic goals are achieved both from a patient point of view and for optimal health care resource utilization.\n\n Published data on treatment adherence with fingolimod (Gilenya®) are limited.\n\n Therefore, this study investigated treatment adherence in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) treated with fingolimod in Denmark.\n\n\nPatients and methods\nThis was a 24-month, multicenter, open-label study, investigating treatment adherence, satisfaction, motivation, and health-related quality of life (QoL) in RRMS patients treated with fingolimod.\n\n In addition, the effect of a motivational interview support program on these measures was evaluated.\n\n Treatment adherence was assessed by pill count.\n\n Treatment satisfaction, motivation, and QoL were assessed by patient-reported outcomes (PROs).\n\n\nResults\nA total of 195 patients were enrolled in the study.\n\n A very high treatment adherence was observed during the entire study with no statistically significant difference between study visits before (99%) and after (97%) the motivational interview.\n\n In accordance, a high level of treatment satisfaction was found in the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication 9, which was scored high throughout the study with the highest scores seen for the convenience domain (ranging from 94.51 to 95.78).\n\n Furthermore, additional PROs demonstrated a high health-related QoL, a self-determined form of motivation for taking medication, and a patient perception of an autonomy supportive approach provided by the health care provider, at all study visits.\n\n\nConclusion\nHigh levels of treatment adherence, satisfaction, motivation, and QoL were observed in Danish RRMS patients treated with fingolimod.\n\n As these positive measures were observed at all study visits and throughout the study, no effect of the motivational interview support program was found.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6029605","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Karen","surname":"Schreiber","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Matthias","surname":"Kant","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Claudia","surname":"Pfleger","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Henrik

the causative agent of COVID-19 respiratory disease, has infected over 2.3 million people, killed over 160,000, and caused worldwide social and economic disruption1,2.\n There are currently no antiviral drugs with proven clinical efficacy, nor are there vaccines for its prevention, and these efforts are hampered by limited knowledge of the molecular details of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n To address this, we cloned, tagged and expressed 26 of the 29 SARS-CoV-2 proteins in human cells and identified the human proteins physically associated with each using affinity-purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS), identifying 332 high-confidence SARS-CoV-2-human protein-protein interactions (PPIs).\n Among these, we identify 66 druggable human proteins or host factors targeted by 69 compounds (29 FDA-approved drugs, 12 drugs in clinical trials, and 28 preclinical compounds).\n Screening a subset of these in multiple viral assays identified two sets of pharmacological agents that displayed antiviral activity: inhibitors of mRNA translation and predicted regulators of the Sigma1 and Sigma2 receptors.\n Further studies of these host factor targeting agents, including their combination with drugs that directly target viral enzymes, could lead to a therapeutic regimen to treat COVID-19.","id":"PMC7431030","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"David E.","surname":"Gordon","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gwendolyn

The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7092819","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Wei-jie","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng-yi","surname":"Ni","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng-yi","surname":"Ni","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yu","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wen-hua","surname":"Liang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chun-quan","surname":"Ou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jian-xing","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Shan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chun-liang","surname":"Lei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"David

the COVID-19 pandemic and other outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases","abstract":"WHO interim guidelines recommend offering extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to eligible patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n The number of patients with COVID-19 infection who might develop severe ARDS that is refractory to maximal medical management and require this level of support is currently unknown.\n Available evidence from similar patient populations suggests that carefully selected patients with severe ARDS who do not benefit from conventional treatment might be successfully supported with venovenous ECMO.\n The need for ECMO is relatively low and its use is mostly restricted to specialised centres globally.\n Providing complex therapies such as ECMO during outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases has unique challenges.\n Careful planning, judicious resource allocation, and training of personnel to provide complex therapeutic interventions while adhering to strict infection control measures are all crucial components of an ECMO action plan.\n ECMO can be initiated in specialist centres, or patients can receive ECMO during transportation from a centre that is not specialised for this procedure to an expert ECMO centre.\n Ensuring that systems enable safe and coordinated movement of critically ill patients, staff, and equipment is important to improve ECMO access.\n ECMO preparedness for the COVID-19 pandemic is important in view of the high transmission rate of the virus and respiratory-related mortality.\n","id":"PMC7102637","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Kollengode","surname":"Ramanathan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"David","surname":"Antognini","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Alain","surname":"Combes","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Matthew","surname":"Paden","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bishoy","surname":"Zakhary","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mark","surname":"Ogino","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Graeme","surname":"MacLaren","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Daniel","surname":"Brodie","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kiran","surname":"Shekar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Natalizumab
