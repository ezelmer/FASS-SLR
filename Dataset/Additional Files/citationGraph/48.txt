We prospectively collected data on demographics, symptoms, Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality/Synergy Between PCI with Taxus and Cardiac Surgery (STS?PROM/SYNTAX) scores, mode of revascularization, and outcomes.\n\n Mean age was 70.0 years; 122 (73.5%) patients were male.\n\n Prevalent comorbidities included diabetes mellitus (51.8%), peripheral artery disease (38.6%), atrial fibrillation (27.1%), end?stage renal disease on dialysis (13.3%), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (21.7%).\n\n Eighty?seven (52.4%) patients had New York Heart Association III?IV and 112 (67.5%) had Canadian Cardiovascular Society III?IV symptomatology.\n\n Sixty?seven (40.4%) patients had left main and 118 (71.1%) had 3?vessel coronary artery disease.\n\n The median STS?PROM was 3.6% (interquartile range 1.9, 8.0) and SYNTAX score was 26 (interquartile range 20, 34).\n\n The median number of physicians per Heart Team meeting was 6 (interquartile range 5, 8).\n\n Seventy?nine (47.6%) and 49 (29.5%) patients underwent percutaneous coronary intervention and coronary artery bypass grafting, respectively.\n\n With increasing STS?PROM (low, intermediate, high operative risk), coronary artery bypass graft was performed less often (47.9%, 18.5%, 15.2%) and optimal medical therapy was recommended more often (11.3%, 18.5%, 30.3%).\n\n There were no trends in recommendation for coronary artery bypass graft, percutaneous coronary intervention, or optimal medical therapy by SYNTAX score tertiles.\n\n In?hospital and 30?day mortality was 3.9% and 4.8%, respectively.\n\n\nConclusions\nIntegrating a multidisciplinary Heart Team into institutional practice is feasible and provides a formalized approach to evaluating complex coronary artery disease patients.\n\n The comprehensive assessment of surgical, anatomical, and other risk scores using a decision aid may guide appropriate, evidence?based management within this team?based construct.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7428540","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Michael N.","surname":"Young","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Dhaval","surname":"Kolte","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mary E.","surname":"Cadigan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Elizabeth","surname":"Laikhter","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kevin","surname":"Sinclair","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Eugene","surname":"Pomerantsev","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Michael A.","surname":"Fifer","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Thoralf M.","surname":"Sundt","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Robert W.","surname":"Yeh","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"                            Farouc A.","surname":"Jaffer","email":"fjaffer@mgh.harvard.edu","contributions":"1"}],"References depth 1":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"2014 ACC/AHA/AATS/PCNA/SCAI/STS focused update of the guideline for the diagnosis and management of patients with stable ischemic heart disease: a report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines, and the American Association for Thoracic Surgery, Preventive Cardiovascular Nurses Association, Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions, and Society of Thoracic Surgeons","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"2014 ESC/EACTS guidelines on myocardial revascularization: the Task Force on Myocardial Revascularization of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (EACTS).

territories, 1990–2019: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019","abstract":"Background\nIn an era of shifting global agendas and expanded emphasis on non-communicable diseases and injuries along with communicable diseases, sound evidence on trends by cause at the national level is essential.\n\n The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) provides a systematic scientific assessment of published, publicly available, and contributed data on incidence, prevalence, and mortality for a mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive list of diseases and injuries.\n\n\nMethods\nGBD estimates incidence, prevalence, mortality, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) due to 369 diseases and injuries, for two sexes, and for 204 countries and territories.\n\n Input data were extracted from censuses, household surveys, civil registration and vital statistics, disease registries, health service use, air pollution monitors, satellite imaging, disease notifications, and other sources.\n\n Cause-specific death rates and cause fractions were calculated using the Cause of Death Ensemble model and spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression.\n\n Cause-specific deaths were adjusted to match the total all-cause deaths calculated as part of the GBD population, fertility, and mortality estimates.\n\n Deaths were multiplied by standard life expectancy at each age to calculate YLLs.\n\n A Bayesian meta-regression modelling tool, DisMod-MR 2.1, was used to ensure consistency between incidence, prevalence, remission, excess mortality, and cause-specific mortality for most causes.\n\n Prevalence estimates were multiplied by disability weights for mutually exclusive sequelae of diseases and injuries to calculate YLDs.\n\n We considered results in the context of the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a composite indicator of income per capita, years of schooling, and fertility rate in females younger than 25 years.\n\n Uncertainty intervals (UIs) were generated for every metric using the 25th and 975th ordered 1000 draw values of the posterior distribution.\n\n\nFindings\nGlobal health has steadily improved over the past 30 years as measured by age-standardised DALY rates.\n\n After taking into account population growth and ageing, the absolute number of DALYs has remained stable.\n\n Since 2010, the pace of decline in global age-standardised DALY rates has accelerated in age groups younger than 50 years compared with the 1990–2010 time period, with the greatest annualised rate of decline occurring in the 0–9-year age group.\n\n Six infectious diseases were among the top ten causes of DALYs in children younger than 10 years in 2019: lower respiratory infections (ranked second), diarrhoeal diseases (third), malaria (fifth), meningitis (sixth), whooping cough (ninth), and sexually transmitted infections (which, in this age group, is fully accounted for by congenital syphilis; ranked tenth).\n\n In adolescents aged 10–24 years, three injury causes were among the top causes of DALYs: road injuries (ranked first), self-harm (third), and interpersonal violence (fifth).\n\n Five of the causes that were in the top ten for ages 10–24 years were also in the top ten in the 25–49-year age group: road injuries (ranked first), HIV/AIDS (second), low back pain (fourth), headache disorders (fifth), and depressive disorders (sixth).\n\n In 2019, ischaemic heart disease and stroke were the top-ranked causes of DALYs in both the 50–74-year and 75-years-and-older age groups.\n\n Since 1990, there has been a marked shift towards a greater proportion of burden due to YLDs from non-communicable diseases and injuries.\n\n In 2019, there were 11 countries where non-communicable disease and injury YLDs constituted more than half of all disease burden.\n\n Decreases in age-standardised DALY rates have accelerated over the past decade in countries at the lower end of the SDI range, while improvements have started to stagnate or even reverse in countries with higher SDI.\n\n\nInterpretation\nAs disability becomes an increasingly large component of disease burden and a larger component of health expenditure, greater research and development investment is needed to identify new, more effective intervention strategies.\n\n With a rapidly ageing global population, the demands on health services to deal with disabling outcomes, which increase with age, will require policy makers to anticipate these changes.\n\n The mix of universal and more geographically specific influences on health reinforces the need for regular reporting on population health in detail and by underlying cause to help decision makers to identify success stories of disease control to emulate, as well as opportunities to improve.\n\n\nFunding\nBill &amp; Melinda Gates

1990–2019: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019","abstract":"Background\nRigorous analysis of levels and trends in exposure to leading risk factors and quantification of their effect on human health are important to identify where public health is making progress and in which cases current efforts are inadequate.\n\n The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019 provides a standardised and comprehensive assessment of the magnitude of risk factor exposure, relative risk, and attributable burden of disease.\n\n\nMethods\nGBD 2019 estimated attributable mortality, years of life lost (YLLs), years of life lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for 87 risk factors and combinations of risk factors, at the global level, regionally, and for 204 countries and territories.\n\n GBD uses a hierarchical list of risk factors so that specific risk factors (eg, sodium intake), and related aggregates (eg, diet quality), are both evaluated.\n\n This method has six analytical steps.\n\n (1) We included 560 risk–outcome pairs that met criteria for convincing or probable evidence on the basis of research studies.\n\n 12 risk–outcome pairs included in GBD 2017 no longer met inclusion criteria and 47 risk–outcome pairs for risks already included in GBD 2017 were added based on new evidence.\n\n (2) Relative risks were estimated as a function of exposure based on published systematic reviews, 81 systematic reviews done for GBD 2019, and meta-regression.\n\n (3) Levels of exposure in each age-sex-location-year included in the study were estimated based on all available data sources using spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression, DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression method, or alternative methods.\n\n (4) We determined, from published trials or cohort studies, the level of exposure associated with minimum risk, called the theoretical minimum risk exposure level.\n\n (5) Attributable deaths, YLLs, YLDs, and DALYs were computed by multiplying population attributable fractions (PAFs) by the relevant outcome quantity for each age-sex-location-year.\n\n (6) PAFs and attributable burden for combinations of risk factors were estimated taking into account mediation of different risk factors through other risk factors.\n\n Across all six analytical steps, 30?652 distinct data sources were used in the analysis.\n\n Uncertainty in each step of the analysis was propagated into the final estimates of attributable burden.\n\n Exposure levels for dichotomous, polytomous, and continuous risk factors were summarised with use of the summary exposure value to facilitate comparisons over time, across location, and across risks.\n\n Because the entire time series from 1990 to 2019 has been re-estimated with use of consistent data and methods, these results supersede previously published GBD estimates of attributable burden.\n\n\nFindings\nThe largest declines in risk exposure from 2010 to 2019 were among a set of risks that are strongly linked to social and economic development, including household air pollution; unsafe water, sanitation, and handwashing; and child growth failure.\n\n Global declines also occurred for tobacco smoking and lead exposure.\n\n The largest increases in risk exposure were for ambient particulate matter pollution, drug use, high fasting plasma glucose, and high body-mass index.\n\n In 2019, the leading Level 2 risk factor globally for attributable deaths was high systolic blood pressure, which accounted for 10·8 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 9·51–12·1) deaths (19·2% [16·9–21·3] of all deaths in 2019), followed by tobacco (smoked, second-hand, and chewing), which accounted for 8·71 million (8·12–9·31) deaths (15·4% [14·6–16·2] of all deaths in 2019).\n\n The leading Level 2 risk factor for attributable DALYs globally in 2019 was child and maternal malnutrition, which largely affects health in the youngest age groups and accounted for 295 million (253–350) DALYs (11·6% [10·3–13·1] of all global DALYs that year).\n\n The risk factor burden varied considerably in 2019 between age groups and locations.\n\n Among children aged 0–9 years, the three leading detailed risk factors for attributable DALYs were all related to malnutrition.\n\n Iron deficiency was the leading risk factor for those aged 10–24 years, alcohol use for those aged 25–49 years, and high systolic blood pressure for those aged 50–74 years and 75 years and older.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOverall, the record for reducing exposure to harmful risks over the past three decades is poor.\n\n Success with reducing smoking and lead exposure through regulatory policy might point the way for a stronger role for public policy on other risks in addition to continued efforts to provide information on risk factor harm to the general

disease, but its usefulness in patients with complex coronary artery disease remains to be investigated.\n\n The present study sought to determine the agreement between separate heart teams on treatment decision-making based on either coronary CTA or conventional angiography.\n\n\n Methods and results\nSeparate heart teams composed of an interventional cardiologist, a cardiac surgeon, and a radiologist were randomized to assess the coronary artery disease with either coronary CTA or conventional angiography in patients with de novo left main or three-vessel coronary artery disease.\n\n Each heart team, blinded for the other imaging modality, quantified the anatomical complexity using the SYNTAX score and integrated clinical information using the SYNTAX Score II to provide a treatment recommendations based on mortality prediction at 4?years: coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), or equipoise between CABG and PCI.\n\n The primary endpoint was the agreement between heart teams on the revascularization strategy.\n\n The secondary endpoint was the impact of fractional flow reserve derived from coronary CTA (FFRCT) on treatment decision and procedural planning.\n\n Overall, 223 patients were included.\n\n A treatment recommendation of CABG was made in 28% of the cases with coronary CTA and in 26% with conventional angiography.\n\n The agreement concerning treatment decision between coronary CTA and conventional angiography was high (Cohen’s kappa 0.82, 95% confidence interval 0.74–0.91).\n\n The heart teams agreed on the coronary segments to be revascularized in 80% of the cases.\n\n FFRCT was available for 869/1108 lesions (196/223 patients).\n\n Fractional flow reserve derived from coronary CTA changed the treatment decision in 7% of the patients.\n\n\nConclusion\nIn patients with left main or three-vessel coronary artery disease, a heart team treatment decision-making based on coronary CTA showed high agreement with the decision derived from conventional coronary angiography suggesting the potential feasibility of a treatment decision-making and planning based solely on this non-invasive

multicentre, single-arm, open-label study of patients requiring revascularization who demonstrated clinical equipoise for treatment with either coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or PCI, predicted by the SYNTAX score II.\n\n The primary endpoint was major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE), which included any revascularization.\n\n The comparators were a matched PCI cohort trial

unclear.\n\n We aimed to compare two revascularisation strategies, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), in patients with AHF.\n\n\nMethods\nAmong 5625 consecutive patients enrolled prospectively in the Korean Acute Heart Failure registry from March 2011 to February 2014, 717 patients who received CABG or PCI during the index hospitalisation for AHF were included in this analysis.\n\n We compared adverse outcomes (death, rehospitalisation for HF aggravation or cardiovascular causes, ischaemic stroke and a composite outcome of death and rehospitalisation for HF aggravation or cardiovascular causes) with the use of propensity score matching.\n\n\nResults\nFor the propensity score-matched cohort with 190 patients, CABG had a lower risk of all-cause mortality than PCI (83 vs 147 deaths per 1000 patient-years; HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.96, p=0.033) during the median follow-up of 4 years.\n\n There was also a trend towards lower rates of rehospitalisation due to cardiovascular events or HF aggravation.\n\n Subgroup analysis revealed that the adverse outcomes were significantly lower in the CABG group than in PCI group, especially in patients with old age, three-vessel diseases, significant proximal left anterior descending artery disease and those without left main vessel disease or chronic total occlusion.\n\n\nConclusions\nCompared with PCI, CABG is associated with significant lower all-cause mortality in patients with AHF.\n\n Further studies should evaluate proper revascularisation strategies in AHF.\n\n\nClinical trial registration\n\nNCT01389843; Results.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6952823","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Sang

cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing Municipal Science and Technology

for COVID-19: A systematic review of nurses’ experiences of working in acute care hospital settings during a respiratory pandemic","abstract":"Background\nPandemics and epidemics are public health emergencies that can result in substantial deaths and socio-economic disruption.\n\n Nurses play a key role in the public health response to such crises, delivering direct patient care and reducing the risk of exposure to the infectious disease.\n\n The experience of providing nursing care in this context has the potential to have significant short and long term consequences for individual nurses, society and the nursing profession.\n\n\nObjectives\nTo synthesize and present the best available evidence on the experiences of nurses working in acute hospital settings during a pandemic.\n\n\nDesign\nThis review was conducted using the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for systematic reviews.\n\n\nData sources\nA structured search using CINAHL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, MedNar, ProQuest and Index to Theses was conducted.\n\n\nReview methods\nAll studies describing nurses’ experiences were included regardless of methodology.\n\n Themes and narrative statements were extracted from included papers using the SUMARI data extraction tool from Joanna Briggs Institute.\n\n\nResults\nThirteen qualitative studies were included in the review.\n\n The experiences of 348 nurses generated a total of 116 findings, which formed seven categories based on similarity of meaning.\n\n Three synthesized findings were generated from the categories: (i) Supportive nursing teams providing quality care; (ii) Acknowledging the physical and emotional impact; and (iii) Responsiveness of systematised organizational reaction.\n\n\nConclusions\nNurses are pivotal to the health care response to infectious disease pandemics and epidemics.\n\n This systematic review emphasises that nurses’ require Governments, policy makers and nursing groups to actively engage in supporting nurses, both during and following a pandemic or epidemic.\n\n Without this, nurses are likely to experience substantial psychological issues that can lead to burnout and loss from the nursing workforce.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7206441","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ritin","surname":"Fernandez","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Heidi","surname":"Lord","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Elizabeth","surname":"Halcomb","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lorna","surname":"Moxham","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rebekkah","surname":"Middleton","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ibrahim","surname":"Alananzeh","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Laura","surname":"Ellwood","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1186/s12888-020-02898-1","date":"2020-09-24","title":"Exploring

Understanding the early transmission dynamics of the infection and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures is crucial for assessing the potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas.\n\n Combining a mathematical model of severe SARS-CoV-2 transmission with four datasets from within and outside Wuhan, we estimated how transmission in Wuhan varied between December, 2019, and February, 2020. We used these estimates to assess the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission to occur in locations outside Wuhan if cases were introduced.\n\n\nMethods\nWe combined a stochastic transmission model with data on cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan and international cases that originated in Wuhan to estimate how transmission had varied over time during January, 2020, and February, 2020. Based on these estimates, we then calculated the probability that newly introduced cases might generate outbreaks in other areas.\n\n To estimate the early dynamics of transmission in Wuhan, we fitted a stochastic transmission dynamic model to multiple publicly available datasets on cases in Wuhan and internationally exported cases from Wuhan.\n\n The four datasets we fitted to were: daily number of new internationally exported cases (or lack thereof), by date of onset, as of Jan 26, 2020; daily number of new cases in Wuhan with no market exposure, by date of onset, between Dec 1, 2019, and Jan 1, 2020; daily number of new cases in China, by date of onset, between Dec 29, 2019, and Jan 23, 2020; and proportion of infected passengers on evacuation flights between Jan 29, 2020, and Feb 4, 2020. We used an additional two datasets for comparison with model outputs: daily number of new exported cases from Wuhan (or lack thereof) in countries with high connectivity to Wuhan (ie, top 20 most at-risk countries), by date of confirmation, as of Feb 10, 2020; and data on new confirmed cases reported in Wuhan between Jan 16, 2020, and Feb 11, 2020.\nFindings\nWe estimated that the median daily reproduction number (Rt) in Wuhan declined from 2·35 (95% CI 1·15–4·77) 1 week before travel restrictions were introduced on Jan 23, 2020, to 1·05 (0·41–2·39) 1 week after.\n\n Based on our estimates of Rt, assuming SARS-like variation, we calculated that in locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan in early January, once there are at least four independently introduced cases, there is a more than 50% chance the infection will establish within that population.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur results show that COVID-19 transmission probably declined in Wuhan during late January, 2020, coinciding with the introduction of travel control measures.\n\n As more cases arrive in international locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan before these control measures, it is likely many chains of transmission will fail to establish initially, but might lead to new outbreaks eventually.\n\n\nFunding\nWellcome Trust, Health Data Research UK, Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, and National Institute for Health Research.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7158569","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Adam J","surname":"Kucharski","email":"adam.kucharski@lshtm.ac.uk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Timothy W","surname":"Russell","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Charlie","surname":"Diamond","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"John","surname":"Edmunds","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sebastian","surname":"Funk","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rosalind M","surname":"Eggo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fiona","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mark","surname":"Jit","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"James D","surname":"Munday","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nicholas","surname":"Davies","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Amy","surname":"Gimma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kevin","surname":"van Zandvoort","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hamish","surname":"Gibbs","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Joel","surname":"Hellewell","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christopher I","surname":"Jarvis","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sam","surname":"Clifford","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Billy J","surname":"Quilty","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nikos I","surname":"Bosse","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sam","surname":"Abbott","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Petra","surname":"Klepac","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Stefan","surname":"Flasche","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1007/s00521-020-05626-8","date":"2020-12-11","title":"A review on COVID-19 forecasting models","abstract":"id='Par1'>The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has spread to more than 200 countries worldwide, leading to more than 36 million confirmed cases as of October 10, 2020.

the USA: a mathematical modelling study","abstract":"Background\nWithin 4 months of COVID-19 first being reported in the USA, it spread to every state and to more than 90% of all counties.\n\n During this period, the US COVID-19 response was highly decentralised, with stay-at-home directives issued by state and local officials, subject to varying levels of enforcement.\n\n The absence of a centralised policy and timeline combined with the complex dynamics of human mobility and the variable intensity of local outbreaks makes assessing the effect of large-scale social distancing on COVID-19 transmission in the USA a challenge.\n\n\nMethods\nWe used daily mobility data derived from aggregated and anonymised cell (mobile) phone data, provided by Teralytics (Zürich, Switzerland) from Jan 1 to April 20, 2020, to capture real-time trends in movement patterns for each US county, and used these data to generate a social distancing metric.\n\n We used epidemiological data to compute the COVID-19 growth rate ratio for a given county on a given day.\n\n Using these metrics, we evaluated how social distancing, measured by the relative change in mobility, affected the rate of new infections in the 25 counties in the USA with the highest number of confirmed cases on April 16, 2020, by fitting a statistical model for each county.\n\n\nFindings\nOur analysis revealed that mobility patterns are strongly correlated with decreased COVID-19 case growth rates for the most affected counties in the USA, with Pearson correlation coefficients above 0·7 for 20 of the 25 counties evaluated.\n\n Additionally, the effect of changes in mobility patterns, which dropped by 35–63% relative to the normal conditions, on COVID-19 transmission are not likely to be perceptible for 9–12 days, and potentially up to 3 weeks, which is consistent with the incubation time of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 plus additional time for reporting.\n\n We also show evidence that behavioural changes were already underway in many US counties days to weeks before state-level or local-level stay-at-home policies were implemented, implying that individuals anticipated public health directives where social distancing was adopted, despite a mixed political message.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThis study strongly supports a role of social distancing as an effective way to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in the USA.\n\n Until a COVID-19 vaccine is widely available, social distancing will remain one of the primary measures to combat disease spread, and these findings should serve to support more timely policy making around social distancing in the USA in the

in biology, the network vocabulary of computational biologists tends to be far more limited than that of, say, social network theorists.\n Here we review and propose several potentially useful network concepts.\n We take advantage of the relationship between network theory and the field of microarray data analysis to clarify the meaning of and the relationship among network concepts in gene coexpression networks.\n Network theory offers a wealth of intuitive concepts for describing the pairwise relationships among genes, which are depicted in cluster trees and heat maps.\n Conversely, microarray data analysis techniques (singular value decomposition, tests of differential expression) can also be used to address difficult problems in network theory.\n We describe conditions when a close relationship exists between network analysis and microarray data analysis techniques, and provide a rough dictionary for translating between the two fields.\n Using the angular interpretation of correlations, we provide a geometric interpretation of network theoretic concepts and derive unexpected relationships among them.\n We use the singular value decomposition of module expression data to characterize approximately factorizable gene coexpression networks, i.\ne.\n, adjacency matrices that factor into node specific contributions.\n High and low level views of coexpression networks allow us to study the relationships among modules and among module genes, respectively.\n We characterize coexpression networks where hub genes are significant with respect to a microarray sample trait and show that the network concept of intramodular connectivity can be interpreted as a fuzzy measure of module membership.\n We illustrate our results using human, mouse, and yeast microarray gene expression data.\n The unification of coexpression network methods with traditional data mining methods can inform the application and development of systems biologic

Human-to-human transmissions have been described with incubation times between 2-10 days, facilitating its spread via droplets, contaminated hands or surfaces.\n We therefore reviewed the literature on all available information about the persistence of human and veterinary coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces as well as inactivation strategies with biocidal agents used for chemical disinfection, e.\ng.\n in healthcare facilities.\n The analysis of 22 studies reveals that human coronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus or endemic human coronaviruses (HCoV) can persist on inanimate surfaces like metal, glass or plastic for up to 9 days, but can be efficiently inactivated by surface disinfection procedures with 62–71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite within 1 minute.\n Other biocidal agents such as 0.05–0.2% benzalkonium chloride or 0.02% chlorhexidine digluconate are less effective.\n As no specific therapies are available for SARS-CoV-2, early containment and prevention of further spread will be crucial to stop the ongoing outbreak and to control this novel infectious

St.\n Mary’s Hospital, South Korea, were investigated.\n The study involved 38 individuals who were infected directly and indirectly with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), by a super-spreader patient.\n Tracer gas experiments conducted on the eighth floor, where the initial patient was hospitalized, confirmed that the tracer gas spread to adjacent patient rooms and rooms across corridors.\n In particular, the experiment with an external wind direction and speed similar to those during the hospitalization of the initial patient revealed that the air change rate was 17–20 air changes per hour (ACH), with air introduced through the window in the room of the infected patient (room 8104).\n The tracer gas concentration of room 8110, which was the farthest room, was 7.56% of room 8104, indicating that a high concentration of gas has spread from room 8104 to rooms across the corridor.\n In contrast, the tracer gas was barely detected in a maternity ward to the south of room 8104, where there was no secondary infected patient.\n Moreover, MERS is known to spread mainly by droplets through close contact, but long-distance dispersion is probable in certain

(TGF-?)-induced expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 but attenuates Smad3/Smad4-mediated apoptosis of human peripheral lung epithelial HPL1 cells.\n The promoting effect of N protein on the transcriptional responses of TGF-? is Smad3-specific.\n N protein associates with Smad3 and promotes Smad3-p300 complex formation while it interferes with the complex formation between Smad3 and Smad4. These findings provide evidence of a novel mechanism whereby N protein modulates TGF-? signaling to block apoptosis of SARS-CoV-infected host cells and meanwhile promote tissue fibrosis.\n Our results reveal a novel mode of Smad3 action in a Smad4-independent manner and may lead to successful strategies for SARS treatment by targeting the TGF-? signaling

These genes differ distinctly among the three coronavirus groups and are specific for each group.\n While the essential genes encode replication and structural functions, hardly anything is known about the products and functions of the group-specific genes.\n As a first step to elucidate their significance, we deleted the group-specific genes from the group 2 mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) genome via a novel targeted recombination system based on host switching (L.\n Kuo, G.\n J.\nGodeke, M.\n J.\n Raamsman, P.\n S.\n Masters, and P.\n J.\n M.\n Rottier, 2000, J.\n Virol.\n 74, 1393–1406).\n Thus, we obtained recombinant viruses from which the two clusters of group-specific genes were deleted either separately or in combination in a controlled genetic background.\n As all recombinant deletion mutant viruses appeared to be viable, we conclude that the MHV group-specific genes are nonessential, accessory genes.\n Importantly, all deletion mutant viruses were attenuated when

Efficacy in Senescent Mice Challenged with Recombinant SARS-CoV Bearing Epidemic and Zoonotic Spike Variants ","abstract":"Background\nIn 2003, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identified as the etiological agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome, a disease characterized by severe pneumonia that sometimes results in death.\n\n SARS-CoV is a zoonotic virus that crossed the species barrier, most likely originating from bats or from other species including civets, raccoon dogs, domestic cats, swine, and rodents.\n\n A SARS-CoV vaccine should confer long-term protection, especially in vulnerable senescent populations, against both the 2003 epidemic strains and zoonotic strains that may yet emerge from animal reservoirs.\n\n We report the comprehensive investigation of SARS vaccine efficacy in young and senescent mice following homologous and heterologous challenge.\n\n\nMethods and Findings\nUsing Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicon particles (VRP) expressing the 2003 epidemic Urbani SARS-CoV strain spike (S) glycoprotein (VRP-S) or the nucleocapsid (N) protein from the same strain (VRP-N), we demonstrate that VRP-S, but not VRP-N vaccines provide complete short- and long-term protection against homologous strain challenge in young and senescent mice.\n\n To test VRP vaccine efficacy against a heterologous SARS-CoV, we used phylogenetic analyses, synthetic biology, and reverse genetics to construct a chimeric virus (icGDO3-S) encoding a synthetic S glycoprotein gene of the most genetically divergent human strain, GDO3, which clusters among the zoonotic SARS-CoV.\n\n icGD03-S replicated efficiently in human airway epithelial cells and in the lungs of young and senescent mice, and was highly resistant to neutralization with antisera directed against the Urbani strain.\n\n Although VRP-S vaccines provided complete short-term protection against heterologous icGD03-S challenge in young mice, only limited protection was seen in vaccinated senescent animals.\n\n VRP-N vaccines not only failed to protect from homologous or heterologous challenge, but resulted in enhanced immunopathology with eosinophilic infiltrates within the lungs of SARS-CoV–challenged mice.\n\n VRP-N–induced pathology presented at day 4, peaked around day 7, and persisted through day 14, and was likely mediated by cellular immune responses.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis study identifies gaps and challenges in vaccine design for controlling future SARS-CoV zoonosis, especially in vulnerable elderly populations.\n\n The availability of a SARS-CoV virus bearing heterologous S glycoproteins provides a robust challenge inoculum for evaluating vaccine efficacy against zoonotic strains, the most likely source of future outbreaks.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1716185","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Damon","surname":"Deming","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Timothy","surname":"Sheahan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mark","surname":"Heise","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Boyd","surname":"Yount","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nancy","surname":"Davis","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Amy","surname":"Sims","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mehul","surname":"Suthar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jack","surname":"Harkema","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Alan","surname":"Whitmore","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Raymond","surname":"Pickles","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ande","surname":"West","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Eric","surname":"Donaldson","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kristopher","surname":"Curtis","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Robert","surname":"Johnston","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ralph","surname":"Baric","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Joseph","surname":"Peiris","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Joseph","surname":"Peiris","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1371/journal.ppat.0030005","date":"2006-11-15","title":"A

disease.\n Young inbred mice support SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) replication in the respiratory tract and are available in sufficient numbers for statistical evaluation.\n They are relatively inexpensive and easily accessible, but their use in SARS research is limited because they do not develop illness following infection.\n Older (12- to 14-mo-old) BALB/c mice develop clinical illness and pneumonitis, but they can be hard to procure, and immune senescence complicates pathogenesis studies.\n We adapted the SARS-CoV (Urbani strain) by serial passage in the respiratory tract of young BALB/c mice.\n Fifteen passages resulted in a virus (MA15) that is lethal for mice following intranasal inoculation.\n Lethality is preceded by rapid and high titer viral replication in lungs, viremia, and dissemination of virus to extrapulmonary sites accompanied by lymphopenia, neutrophilia, and pathological changes in the lungs.\n Abundant viral antigen is extensively distributed in bronchial epithelial cells and alveolar pneumocytes, and necrotic cellular debris is present in airways and alveoli, with only mild and focal pneumonitis.\n These observations suggest that mice infected with MA15 die from an overwhelming viral infection with extensive, virally mediated destruction of pneumocytes and ciliated epithelial cells.\n The MA15 virus has six coding mutations associated with adaptation and increased virulence; when introduced into a recombinant SARS-CoV, these mutations result in a highly virulent and lethal virus (rMA15), duplicating the phenotype of the biologically derived MA15 virus.\n Intranasal inoculation with MA15 reproduces many aspects of disease seen in severe human cases of SARS.\n The availability of the MA15 virus will enhance the use of the mouse model for SARS because infection with MA15 causes morbidity, mortality, and pulmonary pathology.\n This virus will be of value as a stringent challenge in evaluation of the efficacy of

respiratory disease, SARS, with significant mortality.\n Although factors contributing to the highly pathogenic nature of SARS-CoV remain poorly understood, it has been reported that SARS-CoV infection does not induce type I interferons (IFNs) in cell culture.\n However, it is uncertain whether SARS-CoV evades host detection or has evolved mechanisms to counteract innate host defenses.\n We show here that infection of SARS-CoV triggers a weak IFN response in cultured human lung/bronchial epithelial cells without inducing the phosphorylation of IFN-regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), a latent cellular transcription factor that is pivotal for type I IFN synthesis.\n Furthermore, SARS-CoV infection blocked the induction of IFN antiviral activity and the up-regulation of protein expression of a subset of IFN-stimulated genes triggered by double-stranded RNA or an unrelated paramyxovirus.\n In searching for a SARS-CoV protein capable of counteracting innate immunity, we identified the papain-like protease (PLpro) domain as a potent IFN antagonist.\n The inhibition of the IFN response does not require the protease activity of PLpro.\n Rather, PLpro interacts with IRF-3 and inhibits the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF-3, thereby disrupting the activation of type I IFN responses through either Toll-like receptor 3 or retinoic acid-inducible gene I/melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 pathways.\n Our data suggest that regulation of IRF-3-dependent innate antiviral defenses by PLpro may contribute to the establishment of SARS-CoV

Furthermore, high levels of macrophage-inflammatory protein (MIP)-1?, MIP-1?, and MIP-2 mRNA were observed at the onset of MHV-JHM infection and correlated with a marked elevation in the number of

syndrome (SARS) and that the SARS coronavirus (SARS?CoV) nucleoprotein is detectable in the lungs, and other organs and tissues, in these patients.\n In the present study, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization (ISH) assays were used to analyse the expression of angiotensin?converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), SARS?CoV spike (S) protein, and some pro?inflammatory cytokines (PICs) including MCP?1, TGF??1, TNF??, IL?1?, and IL?6 in autopsy tissues from four patients who died of SARS.\n SARS?CoV S protein and its RNA were only detected in ACE2+ cells in the lungs and other organs, indicating that ACE2?expressing cells are the primary targets for SARS?CoV infection in vivo in humans.\n High levels of PICs were expressed in the SARS?CoV?infected ACE2+ cells, but not in the uninfected cells.\n These results suggest that cells infected by SARS?CoV produce elevated levels of PICs which may cause immuno?mediated damage to the lungs and other organs, resulting in ALI and, subsequently, multi?organ dysfunction.\n Therefore application of PIC antagonists may reduce the severity and mortality of SARS.\n Copyright © 2006 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.\n

the ability of the virus to circumvent innate immunity.\n Using functional genomics, we analyzed early host responses to SARS-CoV infection in the lungs of adolescent cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) that show lung pathology similar to that observed in human adults with SARS.\n Analysis of gene signatures revealed induction of a strong innate immune response characterized by the stimulation of various cytokine and chemokine genes, including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and IP-10, which corresponds to the host response seen in acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n As opposed to many in vitro experiments, SARS-CoV induced a wide range of type I interferons (IFNs) and nuclear translocation of phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 in the lungs of macaques.\n Using immunohistochemistry, we revealed that these antiviral signaling pathways were differentially regulated in distinctive subsets of cells.\n Our studies emphasize that the induction of early IFN signaling may be critical to confer protection against SARS-CoV infection and highlight the strength of combining functional genomics with immunohistochemistry to further unravel the

effectiveness of treatment options.\n\n The World Health Organization (WHO) expert panel on SARS treatment requested a systematic review and comprehensive summary of treatments used for SARS-infected patients in order to guide future treatment and identify priorities for research.\n\n\nMethods and Findings\nIn response to the WHO request we conducted a systematic review of the published literature on ribavirin, corticosteroids, lopinavir and ritonavir (LPV/r), type I interferon (IFN), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and SARS convalescent plasma from both in vitro studies and in SARS patients.\n\n We also searched for clinical trial evidence of treatment for acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n Sources of data were the literature databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) up to February 2005. Data from publications were extracted and evidence within studies was classified using predefined criteria.\n\n In total, 54 SARS treatment studies, 15 in vitro studies, and three acute respiratory distress syndrome studies met our inclusion criteria.\n\n Within in vitro studies, ribavirin, lopinavir, and type I IFN showed inhibition of SARS-CoV in tissue culture.\n\n In SARS-infected patient reports on ribavirin, 26 studies were classified as inconclusive, and four showed possible harm.\n\n Seven studies of convalescent plasma or IVIG, three of IFN type I, and two of LPV/r were inconclusive.\n\n In 29 studies of steroid use, 25 were inconclusive and four were classified as causing possible harm.\n\n\nConclusions\nDespite an extensive literature reporting on SARS treatments, it was not possible to determine whether treatments benefited patients during the SARS outbreak.\n\n Some may have been harmful.\n\n Clinical trials should be designed to validate a standard protocol for dosage and timing, and to accrue data in real time during future outbreaks to monitor specific adverse effects and help inform treatment.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1564166","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Lauren

acute respiratory infection in the Arabian Peninsula, Tunisia, Morocco, France, Italy, Germany, and the UK.\n\n We provide a full description of a fatal case of MERS-CoV infection and associated phylogenetic analyses.\n\n\nMethods\nWe report data for a patient who was admitted to the Klinikum Schwabing (Munich, Germany) for severe acute respiratory infection.\n\n We did diagnostic RT-PCR and indirect immunofluorescence.\n\n From time of diagnosis, respiratory, faecal, and urine samples were obtained for virus quantification.\n\n We constructed a maximum likelihood tree of the five available complete MERS-CoV genomes.\n\n\nFindings\nA 73-year-old man from Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, was transferred to Klinikum Schwabing on March 19, 2013, on day 11 of illness.\n\n He had been diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 2008, and had received several lines of treatment.\n\n The patient died on day 18, due to septic shock.\n\n MERS-CoV was detected in two samples of bronchoalveolar fluid.\n\n Viral loads were highest in samples from the lower respiratory tract (up to 1·2?×?106 copies per mL).\n\n Maximum virus concentration in urine samples was 2691 RNA copies per mL on day 13; the virus was not present in the urine after renal failure on day 14. Stool samples obtained on days 12 and 16 contained the virus, with up to 1031 RNA copies per g (close to the lowest detection limit of the assay).\n\n One of two oronasal swabs obtained on day 16 were positive, but yielded little viral RNA (5370 copies per mL).\n\n No virus was detected in blood.\n\n The full virus genome was combined with four other available full genome sequences in a maximum likelihood phylogeny, correlating branch lengths with dates of isolation.\n\n The time of the common ancestor was halfway through 2011. Addition of novel genome data from an unlinked case treated 6 months previously in Essen, Germany, showed a clustering of viruses derived from Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.\n\n\nInterpretation\nWe have provided the first complete viral load profile in a case of MERS-CoV infection.\n\n MERS-CoV might have shedding patterns that are different from those of severe acute respiratory syndrome and so might need alternative diagnostic approaches.\n\n\nFunding\nEuropean Union; German Centre for Infection Research; German Research Council; and German Ministry for

coronavirus: estimation of pandemic risk","abstract":"Background\nThe new Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection shares many clinical, epidemiological, and virological similarities with that of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV.\n\n We aimed to estimate virus transmissibility and the epidemic potential of MERS-CoV, and to compare the results with similar findings obtained for prepandemic SARS.\n\n\nMethods\nWe retrieved data for MERS-CoV clusters from the WHO summary and subsequent reports, and published descriptions of cases, and took into account 55 of the 64 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV reported as of June 21, 2013, excluding cases notified in the previous 2 weeks.\n\n To assess the interhuman transmissibility of MERS-CoV, we used Bayesian analysis to estimate the basic reproduction number (R0) and compared it to that of prepandemic SARS.\n\n We considered two scenarios, depending on the interpretation of the MERS-CoV cluster-size data.\n\n\nResults\nWith our most pessimistic scenario (scenario 2), we estimated MERS-CoV R0 to be 0·69 (95% CI 0·50–0·92); by contrast, the R0 for prepandemic SARS-CoV was 0·80 (0·54–1·13).\n\n Our optimistic scenario (scenario 1) yielded a MERS-CoV R0 of 0·60 (0·42–0·80).\n\n Because of recent implementation of effective contact tracing and isolation procedures, further MERS-CoV transmission data might no longer describe an entire cluster, but only secondary infections directly caused by the index patient.\n\n Hence, we calculated that, under scenario 2, eight or more secondary infections caused by the next index patient would translate into a 5% or higher chance that the revised MERS-CoV R0 would exceed 1—ie, that MERS-CoV might have pandemic potential.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur analysis suggests that MERS-CoV does not yet have pandemic potential.\n\n We recommend enhanced surveillance, active contact tracing, and vigorous searches for the MERS-CoV animal hosts and transmission routes to human beings.\n\n\nFunding\nAgence Nationale de la Recherche (Labex Integrative Biology of Emerging Infectious Diseases), and the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme project

We report detailed clinical and virological data for two related cases of MERS-CoV disease, after nosocomial transmission of the virus from one patient to another in a French hospital.\n\n\nMethods\nPatient 1 visited Dubai in April, 2013; patient 2 lives in France and did not travel abroad.\n\n Both patients had underlying immunosuppressive disorders.\n\n We tested specimens from the upper (nasopharyngeal swabs) or the lower (bronchoalveolar lavage, sputum) respiratory tract and whole blood, plasma, and serum specimens for MERS-CoV by real-time RT-PCR targeting the upE and Orf1A genes of MERS-CoV.\n\n\nFindings\nInitial clinical presentation included fever, chills, and myalgia in both patients, and for patient 1, diarrhoea.\n\n Respiratory symptoms rapidly became predominant with acute respiratory failure leading to mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).\n\n Both patients developed acute renal failure.\n\n MERS-CoV was detected in lower respiratory tract specimens with high viral load (eg, cycle threshold [Ct] values of 22·9 for upE and 24 for Orf1a for a bronchoalveolar lavage sample from patient 1; Ct values of 22·5 for upE and 23·9 for Orf1a for an induced sputum sample from patient 2), whereas nasopharyngeal specimens were weakly positive or inconclusive.\n\n The two patients shared the same room for 3 days.\n\n The incubation period was estimated at 9–12 days for the second case.\n\n No secondary transmission was documented in hospital staff despite the absence of specific protective measures before the diagnosis of MERS-CoV was suspected.\n\n Patient 1 died on May 28, due to refractory multiple organ failure.\n\n\nInterpretation\nPatients with respiratory symptoms returning from the Middle East or exposed to a confirmed case should be isolated and investigated for MERS-CoV with lower respiratory tract sample analysis and an assumed incubation period of 12 days.\n\n Immunosuppression should also be taken into account as a risk factor.\n\n\nFunding\nFrench Institute for Public Health Surveillance, ANR grant Labex Integrative Biology of Emerging Infectious

Infection with Novel Human Coronavirus EMC Predicts Potential Antivirals and Important Differences with SARS Coronavirus","abstract":"A novel human coronavirus (HCoV-EMC) was recently identified in the Middle East as the causative agent of a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) resembling the illness caused by SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV).\n Although derived from the CoV family, the two viruses are genetically distinct and do not use the same receptor.\n Here, we investigated whether HCoV-EMC and SARS-CoV induce similar or distinct host responses after infection of a human lung epithelial cell line.\n HCoV-EMC was able to replicate as efficiently as SARS-CoV in Calu-3 cells and similarly induced minimal transcriptomic changes before 12 h postinfection.\n Later in infection, HCoV-EMC induced a massive dysregulation of the host transcriptome, to a much greater extent than SARS-CoV.\n Both viruses induced a similar activation of pattern recognition receptors and the interleukin 17 (IL-17) pathway, but HCoV-EMC specifically down-regulated the expression of several genes within the antigen presentation pathway, including both type I and II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes.\n This could have an important impact on the ability of the host to mount an adaptive host response.\n A unique set of 207 genes was dysregulated early and permanently throughout infection with HCoV-EMC, and was used in a computational screen to predict potential antiviral compounds, including kinase inhibitors and glucocorticoids.\n Overall, HCoV-EMC and SARS-CoV elicit distinct host gene expression responses, which might impact in vivo pathogenesis and could orient therapeutic strategies against that emergent virus.\n","id":"PMC3663187","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Laurence","surname":"Josset","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Vineet

during Early Lung Development","abstract":"Many organs of higher organisms, such as the vascular system, lung, kidney, pancreas, liver and glands, are heavily branched structures.\n The branching process during lung development has been studied in great detail and is remarkably stereotyped.\n The branched tree is generated by the sequential, non-random use of three geometrically simple modes of branching (domain branching, planar and orthogonal bifurcation).\n While many regulatory components and local interactions have been defined an integrated understanding of the regulatory network that controls the branching process is lacking.\n We have developed a deterministic, spatio-temporal differential-equation based model of the core signaling network that governs lung branching morphogenesis.\n The model focuses on the two key signaling factors that have been identified in experiments, fibroblast growth factor (FGF10) and sonic hedgehog (SHH) as well as the SHH receptor patched (Ptc).\n We show that the reported biochemical interactions give rise to a Schnakenberg-type Turing patterning mechanisms that allows us to reproduce experimental observations in wildtype and mutant mice.\n The kinetic parameters as well as the domain shape are based on experimental data where available.\n The developed model is robust to small absolute and large relative changes in the parameter values.\n At the same time there is a strong regulatory potential in that the switching between branching modes can be achieved by targeted changes in the parameter values.\n We note that the sequence of different branching events may also be the result of different growth speeds: fast growth triggers lateral branching while slow growth favours bifurcations in our model.\n We conclude that the FGF10-SHH-Ptc1 module is sufficient to generate pattern that correspond to the observed branching modes.\n","id":"PMC3280966","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Denis","surname":"Menshykau","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Conradin","surname":"Kraemer","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dagmar","surname":"Iber","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Edmund

The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days

Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12

patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar

general ward.\n Performing HP/CRRT at the early stages of ARDS can obviate the need for intubating patients with COVID-19. Punctual and early use of HP and CRRT in the treatment of ARDS in patients with COVID-19 prevented the progression of ARDS and patient intubation, reduced respiratory distress and the patient's

study\nTo observe the clinical effect of plasmapheresis on excessive inflammatory reaction and immune features in patients with severe COVID-19 at risk of ARDS.\n\n\nMaterials and methods\nIn this single-center study, we included 15 confirmed cases of COVID-19 at Masih Daneshvari Hospital, in March 2020 in Tehran, Iran.\n\n COVID-19 cases were confirmed by RT-PCR and CT imaging according to WHO guidelines.\n\n Plasmapheresis was performed to alleviate cytokine-induced ARDS.\n\n The improvement in oxygen delivery (PaO2/FiO2), total number of T cells, liver enzymes, acute reaction proteins, TNF-? and IL-6 levels were evaluated.\n\n\nResults\nInflammatory cytokine levels (TNF-?, IL-6), and acute phase reaction proteins including ferritin and CRP were high before plasmapheresis.\n\n After plasmapheresis, the levels of PaO2/FiO2, acute phase reactants, inflammatory mediators, liver enzymes and bilirubin were significantly reduced within a week (p?&lt;?0.05).\n\n In contrast, although

complication of COVID-19 most commonly resulting in respiratory failure.\n\n This ten-patient study was designed to determine the efficacy of therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) in improving oxygenation and in reducing the cytokine load in a critically ill subset of patients.\n\n\nMethods\nFive single volume plasma exchanges over eight days within a 14-day study period.\n\n In mechanically ventilated patients, oxygenation was measured via the PaO2/FiO2 (P/F) ratio and the oxygenation index (OI) daily for 14 days.\n\n Supplemental oxygen requirements were tracked daily for non-ventilated patients.\n\n\nResults\nNon-ventilated patients were liberated from supplemental oxygen after TPE.\n\n The response was rapid with an 87% average reduction in oxygenation requirements following and average time to return to room air of 5.25 days.\n\n All mechanically ventilated patients demonstrated improvement in oxygenation with a 78% average improvement in the P/F ratio and a 43% improvement in OI.\n\n C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum levels of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF?, IFN? and GM-CSF, were measured daily with immediate post TPE levels drawn on days 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8.

this retrospective cohort study, we included adults (aged ?16 years) with laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection and pneumonia needing ventilation support, diagnosed between Oct 23, 2012, and May 1, 2014, at the Prince Sultan Military Medical City (Riyadh, Saudi Arabia).\n\n All patients received appropriate supportive care and regular clinical and laboratory monitoring, but patients diagnosed after Sept 16, 2013, were also given oral ribavirin (dose based on calculated creatinine clearance, for 8–10 days) and subcutaneous pegylated interferon alfa-2a (180 ?g per week for 2 weeks).\n\n The primary endpoint was 14-day and 28-day survival from the date of MERS-CoV infection diagnosis.\n\n We used ?2 and Fischer's exact test to analyse categorical variables and the t test to analyse continuous variables.\n\n\nFindings\nWe analysed 20 patients who received ribavirin and interferon (treatment group; initiated a median of 3 days [range 0–8] after diagnosis) and 24 who did not (comparator group).\n\n Baseline clinical and laboratory characteristics were similar between groups, apart from baseline absolute neutrophil count, which was significantly lower in the comparator

relatively high concentrations; however, when combined, lower concentrations of interferon-?2b and ribavirin achieved comparable endpoints.\n Thus, a combination of interferon-?2b and ribavirin, which are already commonly used in the clinic, may be useful for patient management in the event of future nCoV infections.\n","id":"PMC3629412","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Darryl","surname":"Falzarano","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Emmie","surname":"de

best treatment to propose.\n The World Health Organization, as well as several other national agencies, are still working on different clinical approaches to implement the most relevant treatment in MERS-CoV infection.\n We compared innate and adaptive immune responses of two patients infected with MERS-CoV to understand the underlying mechanisms involved in the response and propose potential therapeutic approaches.\n Broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) of the first week and sera of the first month from the two patients were used in this study.\n Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRTPCR) was performed after extraction of RNA from BAL cells of MERS-CoV infected patients and control patients.\n BAL supernatants and sera were used to assess cytokines and chemokines secretion by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.\n The first patient died rapidly after 3 weeks in the intensive care unit, the second patient still recovers from infection.\n The patient with a poor outcome (patient 1), compared to patient 2, did not promote type-1 Interferon (IFN), and particularly IFN?, in response to double stranded RNA (dsRNA) from MERS-CoV.\n The absence of IFN?, known to promote antigen presentation in response to viruses, impairs the development of a robust antiviral adaptive Th-1 immune response.\n This response is mediated by IL-12 and IFN? that decreases viral clearance; levels of both of these mediators were decreased in patient 1. Finally, we confirm previous in vitro findings that MERS-CoV can drive IL-17 production in humans.\n Host recognition of viral dsRNA determines outcome in the early stage of MERS-CoV infection.\n We highlight the critical role of IFN? in this initial stage to orchestrate a robust immune response and bring substantial arguments for the indication of early IFN? treatment during MERS-CoV infection.\n","id":"PMC3925152","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Emmanuel","surname":"Faure","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Julien","surname":"Poissy","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Anne","surname":"Goffard","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Clement","surname":"Fournier","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Eric","surname":"Kipnis","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Marie","surname":"Titecat","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Perinne","surname":"Bortolotti","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Laura","surname":"Martinez","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sylvain","surname":"Dubucquoi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rodrigue","surname":"Dessein","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Philippe","surname":"Gosset","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Daniel","surname":"Mathieu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Benoit","surname":"Guery","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fausto","surname":"Baldanti","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fausto","surname":"Baldanti","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1128/JVI.03496-12","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Human cell tropism and innate immune system interactions of human respiratory coronavirus EMC compared to those of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1099/vir.0.052910-0","date":"2013-04-22","title":"MERS-coronavirus replication induces severe <italic>in vitro</italic> cytopathology and is strongly inhibited by cyclosporin A or interferon-? treatment","abstract":"Coronavirus (CoV) infections are commonly associated with respiratory and enteric disease in humans and animals.\n The 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) highlighted the potentially lethal consequences of CoV-induced disease in humans.\n In 2012, a novel CoV (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus; MERS-CoV) emerged, causing 49 human cases thus far, of which 23 had a fatal outcome.\n In this study, we characterized MERS-CoV replication and cytotoxicity in human and monkey cell lines.\n Electron microscopy of infected Vero cells revealed extensive membrane rearrangements, including the formation of double-membrane vesicles and convoluted membranes, which have been implicated previously in the RNA synthesis of SARS-CoV and other CoVs.\n Following infection, we observed rapidly increasing viral RNA synthesis and release of high titres of infectious progeny, followed by a pronounced cytopathology.\n These characteristics were used to develop an assay for antiviral compound screening in 96-well format, which was used to identify cyclosporin A as an inhibitor of MERS-CoV replication in cell culture.\n Furthermore, MERS-CoV was found to be 50–100 times more sensitive to alpha interferon (IFN-?) treatment than SARS-CoV, an observation that may have important implications for the treatment of MERS-CoV-infected patients.\n MERS-CoV infection did not prevent the IFN-induced nuclear translocation of phosphorylated STAT1, in contrast to infection with SARS-CoV where this block inhibits the expression of antiviral genes.\n These findings highlight relevant differences between these distantly related zoonotic CoVs in terms of their interaction with and evasion of the cellular innate immune response.\n","id":"PMC3749523","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Adriaan H.","surname":"de Wilde","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"V.

Diagnosis was confirmed in all patients using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction on respiratory samples.\n\n\nResults\nDuring the observation period, 31 patients were admitted with MERS-CoV infection (mean age 59?±?20 years, 22 [71 %] males).\n\n Cough and tachypnea were reported in all patients; 22 (77.4 %) patients had bilateral pulmonary infiltrates.\n\n Invasive mechanical ventilation was applied in 27 (87.1 %) and vasopressor therapy in 25 (80.6 %) patients during the intensive care unit stay.\n\n Twenty-three (74.2 %) patients died in the ICU.\n\n Nonsurvivors were older, had greater APACHE II and SOFA scores on admission, and were more likely to have received invasive mechanical ventilation and vasopressor therapy.\n\n After adjustment for the severity of illness and the degree of organ dysfunction, the need for vasopressors was an independent risk factor for death in the ICU (odds ratio?=?18.33, 95 % confidence interval: 1.11–302.1, P?=?0.04).\n\n\nConclusions\nMERS-CoV infection requiring admission to the ICU is associated with high morbidity and mortality.\n\n The need for vasopressor therapy is the main risk factor for death in these patients.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13054-016-1303-8) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).\n\n However, the actual number of infections in people who have had contact with camels is unknown and most index patients cannot recall any such contact.\n\n We aimed to do a nationwide serosurvey in Saudi Arabia to establish the prevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies, both in the general population and in populations of individuals who have maximum exposure to camels.\n\n\nMethods\nIn the cross-sectional serosurvey, we tested human serum samples obtained from healthy individuals older than 15 years who attended primary health-care centres or participated in a national burden-of-disease study in all 13 provinces of Saudi Arabia.\n\n Additionally, we tested serum samples from shepherds and abattoir workers with occupational exposure to camels.\n\n Samples were screened by recombinant ELISA and MERS-CoV seropositivity was confirmed by recombinant immunofluorescence and plaque reduction neutralisation tests.\n\n We used two-tailed Mann Whitney U exact tests, ?2, and Fisher's exact tests to analyse the data.\n\n\nFindings\nBetween Dec 1, 2012, and Dec 1, 2013, we obtained individual serum samples from 10?009 individuals.\n\n Anti-MERS-CoV antibodies were confirmed in 15 (0·15%; 95% CI 0·09–0·24) of 10?009 people in six of the 13 provinces.\n\n The mean age of seropositive individuals was significantly younger than that of patients with reported, laboratory-confirmed, primary Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (43·5 years [SD 17·3] vs 53·8 years [17·5]; p=0·008).\n\n Men had a higher antibody prevalence than did women (11 [0·25%] of 4341 vs two [0·05%] of 4378; p=0·028) and antibody prevalence was significantly higher in central versus coastal provinces (14 [0·26%] of 5479 vs one [0·02%] of 4529; p=0·003).\n\n Compared with the general population, seroprevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies was significantly increased by 15 times in shepherds (two [2·3%] of 87, p=0·0004) and by 23 times in slaughterhouse workers (five [3·6%] of 140; p&lt;0·0001).\n\n\nInterpretation\nSeroprevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies was significantly higher in camel-exposed individuals than in the general population.\n\n By simple multiplication, a projected 44?951 (95% CI 26?971–71?922) individuals older than 15 years might be seropositive for MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia.\n\n These individuals might be the source of infection for patients with confirmed MERS who had no previous exposure to camels.\n\n\nFunding\nEuropean Union, German Centre for Infection Research, Federal Ministry of Education and

had been more than 5 years since the first case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus infection (MERS-CoV) was recorded, but no specific treatment has been investigated in randomized clinical trials.\n\n Results from in vitro and animal studies suggest that a combination of lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon-?1b (IFN-?1b) may be effective against MERS-CoV.\n\n The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of treatment with a combination of lopinavir/ritonavir and recombinant IFN-?1b provided with standard supportive care, compared to treatment with placebo provided with standard supportive care in patients with laboratory-confirmed MERS requiring hospital admission.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>The protocol is prepared in accordance with the SPIRIT (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials) guidelines.\n\n Hospitalized adult patients with laboratory-confirmed MERS will be enrolled in this recursive, two-stage, group sequential, multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind randomized controlled trial.\n\n The trial is initially designed to include 2 two-stage components.\n\n The first two-stage component is designed to adjust sample size and determine futility stopping, but not efficacy stopping.\n\n The second two-stage component is designed to determine efficacy stopping and possibly readjustment of sample size.\n\n The primary outcome is 90-day mortality.\n\n\nDiscussion\nid='Par3'>This will be the first randomized controlled trial of a potential treatment for MERS.\n\n The study is sponsored by King

extension, and termination of RNA synthesis by a paramyxovirus polymerase","abstract":"Paramyxoviruses represent a family of RNA viruses causing significant human diseases.\n These include measles virus, the most infectious virus ever reported, in addition to parainfluenza virus, and other emerging viruses.\n Paramyxoviruses likely share common replication machinery but their mechanisms of RNA biosynthesis activities and details of their complex polymerase structures are unknown.\n Mechanistic and functional details of a paramyxovirus polymerase would have sweeping implications for understanding RNA virus replication and for the development of new antiviral medicines.\n To study paramyxovirus polymerase structure and function, we expressed an active recombinant Nipah virus (NiV) polymerase complex assembled from the multifunctional NiV L protein bound to its phosphoprotein cofactor.\n NiV is an emerging highly pathogenic virus that causes severe encephalitis and has been declared a global public health concern due to its high mortality rate.\n Using negative-stain electron microscopy, we demonstrated NiV polymerase forms ring-like particles resembling related RNA polymerases.\n We identified conserved sequence elements driving recognition of the 3?-terminal genomic promoter by NiV polymerase, and leading to initiation of RNA synthesis, primer extension, and transition to elongation mode.\n Polyadenylation resulting from NiV polymerase stuttering provides a mechanistic basis for transcription termination.\n It also suggests a divergent adaptation in promoter recognition between pneumo- and paramyxoviruses.\n The lack of available antiviral therapy for NiV prompted us to identify the triphosphate forms of R1479 and GS-5734, two clinically relevant nucleotide analogs, as substrates and inhibitors of NiV polymerase activity by delayed chain termination.\n Overall, these findings provide low-resolution structural details and the mechanism of an RNA polymerase from a previously uncharacterized virus family.\n This work illustrates important functional differences yet remarkable similarities between the polymerases of nonsegmented negative-strand RNA viruses.\n","id":"PMC5823471","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Paul

there are no approved therapeutics for any human CoV presenting a clear unmet medical need.\n Remdesivir (RDV, GS-5734) is a monophosphoramidate prodrug of an adenosine analog with potent activity against an array of RNA virus families including Filoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Pneumoviridae, and Orthocoronavirinae, through the targeting of the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp).\n We developed multiple assays to further define the breadth of RDV antiviral activity against the CoV family.\n Here, we show potent antiviral activity of RDV against endemic human CoVs OC43 (HCoV-OC43) and 229E (HCoV-229E) with submicromolar EC50 values.\n Of known CoVs, the members of the deltacoronavirus genus have the most divergent RdRp as compared to SARS- and MERS-CoV and both avian and porcine members harbor a native residue in the RdRp that confers resistance in beta-CoVs.\n Nevertheless, RDV is highly efficacious against porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV).\n These data further

bronchioles.\n From 4 to 6 days postinfection, interstitial pneumonia with alveolar collapse expanded throughout the lungs.\n From 6 to 9 days postinfection, DAD with severe alveolar collapse was

macaque model of MERS-CoV has been established, the lack of uniform, severe disease in this model complicates the analysis of countermeasure studies.\n Modeling of the interaction between the MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein and its receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 predicted comparable interaction energies in common marmosets and humans.\n The suitability of the marmoset as a MERS-CoV model was tested by inoculation via combined intratracheal, intranasal, oral and ocular routes.\n Most of the marmosets developed a progressive severe pneumonia leading to euthanasia of some animals.\n Extensive lesions were evident in the lungs of all animals necropsied at different time points post inoculation.\n Some animals were also viremic; high viral loads were detected in the lungs of all infected animals, and total RNAseq demonstrated the induction of immune and inflammatory pathways.\n This is the first description of a severe, partially lethal, disease model of MERS-CoV, and as such will have a major impact on the ability to assess the efficacy of vaccines and treatment strategies as well as allowing more detailed pathogenesis

in the Republic of Korea","abstract":"Background\nFrom May to July 2015, the Republic of Korea experienced the largest outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outside the Arabian Peninsula.\n\n A total of 186 patients, including 36 deaths, had been diagnosed with MERS-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection as of September 30th, 2015.\nMaterials and Methods\nWe obtained information of patients who were confirmed to have MERS-CoV infection.\n\n MERS-CoV infection was diagnosed using real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 55 years (range, 16 to 86).\n\n A total of 55.4% of the patients had one or more coexisting medical conditions.\n\n The most common symptom was fever (95.2%).\n\n At admission, leukopenia (42.6%), thrombocytopenia (46.6%), and elevation of aspartate aminotransferase (42.7%) were observed.\n\n Pneumonia was detected in 68.3% of patients at admission and developed in 80.8% during the disease course.\n\n Antiviral agents were used for 74.7% of patients.\n\n Mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and convalescent serum were employed for 24.5%, 7.1%, and 3.8% of patients, respectively.\n\n Older age, presence of coexisting medical conditions including diabetes or chronic lung disease, presence of dyspnea, hypotension, and leukocytosis at admission, and the use of mechanical ventilation were revealed to be independent predictors of death.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe clinical features of MERS-CoV infection in the Republic of Korea were similar to those of previous outbreaks in the Middle East.\n\n However, the overall mortality rate (20.4%) was lower than that in previous reports.\n\n Enhanced surveillance and active management of patients during the outbreak may have resulted in improved outcomes.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4945721","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Won

and epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and Prevention of Infectious Disease in China,

Unfortunately, there are few tools available to functionally test these viruses for their ability to infect humans, which has severely hampered efforts to predict the next zoonotic viral outbreak.\n Here, we developed an approach to rapidly screen lineage B betacoronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and the recent SARS-CoV-2, for receptor usage and their ability to infect cell types from different species.\n We show that host protease processing during viral entry is a significant barrier for several lineage B viruses and that bypassing this barrier allows several lineage B viruses to enter

however, the genetic mechanisms underlying cross-species adaptation remain poorly understood.\n Variation in the host receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), can block the interaction with the MERS-CoV spike protein and form a species barrier to infection.\n To better understand the species adaptability of MERS-CoV, we identified a suboptimal species-derived variant of DPP4 to study viral adaption.\n Passaging virus on cells expressing this DPP4 variant led to accumulation of mutations in the viral spike which increased replication.\n Parallel passages revealed distinct paths of viral adaptation to the same DPP4 variant.\n Structural analysis and functional assays showed that these mutations enhanced viral entry with suboptimal DPP4 by altering the surface charge of spike.\n These

implication of a novel beta (?)-CoV as the cause of fatal respiratory disease in the Middle East emphasizes the importance of surveillance for CoVs that have potential to move from bats into the human population.\n In a screen of 606 bats from 42 different species in Campeche, Chiapas and Mexico City we identified 13 distinct CoVs.\n Nine were alpha (?)-CoVs; four were ?-CoVs.\n Twelve were novel.\n Analyses of these viruses in the context of their hosts and ecological habitat indicated that host species is a strong selective driver in CoV evolution, even in allopatric populations separated by significant geographical distance; and that a single species/genus of bat can contain multiple CoVs.\n A ?-CoV with 96.5?% amino acid identity to the ?-CoV associated with human disease in the Middle East was found in a Nyctinomops laticaudatus bat, suggesting that efforts to identify the viral reservoir should include surveillance of the bat families Molossidae/Vespertilionidae, or the closely related Nycteridae/Emballonuridae.\n While it is important to investigate unknown viral diversity in bats, it is also important to remember that the majority of viruses they carry will not pose any clinical risk, and bats should not be stigmatized ubiquitously as significant threats to public health.\n","id":"PMC3709589","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"S.

We also compare S proteins of SARS-CoV isolated during the 2002–2003 SARS outbreak and during the much less severe 2003–2004 outbreak, and from palm civets, a possible source of SARS-CoV found in humans.\n All three S proteins bound to and utilized palm-civet ACE2 efficiently, but the latter two S proteins utilized human ACE2 markedly less efficiently than did the S protein obtained during the earlier human outbreak.\n The lower affinity of these S proteins could be complemented by altering specific residues within the S-protein-binding site of human ACE2 to those of civet ACE2, or by altering S-protein residues 479 and 487 to residues conserved during the 2002–2003 outbreak.\n Collectively, these data describe molecular interactions important to the adaptation of SARS-CoV to human cells, and provide insight into the severity of the 2002–2003 SARS epidemic.\n","id":"PMC1142572","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Wenhui","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chengsheng","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jianhua","surname":"Sui","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jens H","surname":"Kuhn","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Michael J","surname":"Moore","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shiwen","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Swee-Kee","surname":"Wong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"I-Chueh","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Keming","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Natalya","surname":"Vasilieva","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Akikazu","surname":"Murakami","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yaqing","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wayne A","surname":"Marasco","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hyeryun","surname":"Choe","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Michael","surname":"Farzan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1128/JVI.02219-09","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Ecoepidemiology and complete genome comparison of different strains of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related Rhinolophus bat coronavirus in China reveal bats as a reservoir for acute, self-limiting infection that allows recombination events","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1128/JVI.01121-10","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Coexistence of different genotypes in the same bat and serological characterization of Rousettus bat coronavirus HKU9 belonging to a novel Betacoronavirus subgroup","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1073/pnas.0409608102","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Cross-host evolution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus in palm civet and human","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.3201/eid1911.131172","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus in Bats, Saudi Arabia","abstract":"The source of human infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus remains unknown.\n Molecular investigation indicated that bats in Saudi Arabia are infected with several alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses.\n Virus from 1 bat showed 100% nucleotide identity to virus from the human index case-patient.\n Bats might play a role in human infection.\n","id":"PMC3837665","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ziad A.","surname":"Memish","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nischay","surname":"Mishra","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kevin J.","surname":"Olival","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shamsudeen F.","surname":"Fagbo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Vishal","surname":"Kapoor","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jonathan H.","surname":"Epstein","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rafat","surname":"AlHakeem","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Abdulkareem","surname":"Durosinloun","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mushabab","surname":"Al Asmari","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ariful","surname":"Islam","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Amit","surname":"Kapoor","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Thomas","surname":"Briese","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peter","surname":"Daszak","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Abdullah A.","surname":"Al Rabeeah","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"W.

associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile

pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

to affect older males with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n In general, characteristics of patients who died

East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection","abstract":"Background\nThe Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an emerging virus involved in cases and case clusters of severe acute respiratory infection in the Arabian Peninsula, Tunisia, Morocco, France, Italy, Germany, and the UK.\n\n We provide a full description of a fatal case of MERS-CoV infection and associated phylogenetic analyses.\n\n\nMethods\nWe report data for a patient who was admitted to the Klinikum Schwabing (Munich, Germany) for severe acute respiratory infection.\n\n We did diagnostic RT-PCR and indirect immunofluorescence.\n\n From time of diagnosis, respiratory, faecal, and urine samples were obtained for virus quantification.\n\n We constructed a maximum likelihood tree of the five available complete MERS-CoV genomes.\n\n\nFindings\nA 73-year-old man from Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, was transferred to Klinikum Schwabing on March 19, 2013, on day 11 of illness.\n\n He had been diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 2008, and had received several lines of treatment.\n\n The patient died on day 18, due to septic shock.\n\n MERS-CoV was detected in two samples of bronchoalveolar fluid.\n\n Viral loads were highest in samples from the lower respiratory tract (up to 1·2?×?106 copies per mL).\n\n Maximum virus concentration in urine samples was 2691 RNA copies per mL on day 13; the virus was not present in the urine after renal failure on day 14. Stool samples obtained on days 12 and 16 contained the virus, with up to 1031 RNA copies per g (close to the lowest detection limit of the assay).\n\n One of two oronasal swabs obtained on day 16 were positive, but yielded little viral RNA (5370 copies per mL).\n\n No virus was detected in blood.\n\n The full virus genome was combined with four other available full genome sequences in a maximum likelihood phylogeny, correlating branch lengths with dates of isolation.\n\n The time of the common ancestor was halfway through 2011. Addition of novel genome data from an unlinked case treated 6 months previously in Essen, Germany, showed a clustering of viruses derived from Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.\n\n\nInterpretation\nWe have provided the first complete viral load profile in a case of MERS-CoV infection.\n\n MERS-CoV might have shedding patterns that are different from those of severe acute respiratory syndrome and so might need alternative diagnostic approaches.\n\n\nFunding\nEuropean Union; German Centre for Infection Research; German Research Council; and German Ministry for

coronavirus: estimation of pandemic risk","abstract":"Background\nThe new Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection shares many clinical, epidemiological, and virological similarities with that of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV.\n\n We aimed to estimate virus transmissibility and the epidemic potential of MERS-CoV, and to compare the results with similar findings obtained for prepandemic SARS.\n\n\nMethods\nWe retrieved data for MERS-CoV clusters from the WHO summary and subsequent reports, and published descriptions of cases, and took into account 55 of the 64 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV reported as of June 21, 2013, excluding cases notified in the previous 2 weeks.\n\n To assess the interhuman transmissibility of MERS-CoV, we used Bayesian analysis to estimate the basic reproduction number (R0) and compared it to that of prepandemic SARS.\n\n We considered two scenarios, depending on the interpretation of the MERS-CoV cluster-size data.\n\n\nResults\nWith our most pessimistic scenario (scenario 2), we estimated MERS-CoV R0 to be 0·69 (95% CI 0·50–0·92); by contrast, the R0 for prepandemic SARS-CoV was 0·80 (0·54–1·13).\n\n Our optimistic scenario (scenario 1) yielded a MERS-CoV R0 of 0·60 (0·42–0·80).\n\n Because of recent implementation of effective contact tracing and isolation procedures, further MERS-CoV transmission data might no longer describe an entire cluster, but only secondary infections directly caused by the index patient.\n\n Hence, we calculated that, under scenario 2, eight or more secondary infections caused by the next index patient would translate into a 5% or higher chance that the revised MERS-CoV R0 would exceed 1—ie, that MERS-CoV might have pandemic potential.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur analysis suggests that MERS-CoV does not yet have pandemic potential.\n\n We recommend enhanced surveillance, active contact tracing, and vigorous searches for the MERS-CoV animal hosts and transmission routes to human beings.\n\n\nFunding\nAgence Nationale de la Recherche (Labex Integrative Biology of Emerging Infectious Diseases), and the European Community's

the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future

We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7121484","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Qun","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuhua","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoye","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yeqing","surname":"Tong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ruiqi","surname":"Ren","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kathy

during Early Lung Development","abstract":"Many organs of higher organisms, such as the vascular system, lung, kidney, pancreas, liver and glands, are heavily branched structures.\n The branching process during lung development has been studied in great detail and is remarkably stereotyped.\n The branched tree is generated by the sequential, non-random use of three geometrically simple modes of branching (domain branching, planar and orthogonal bifurcation).\n While many regulatory components and local interactions have been defined an integrated understanding of the regulatory network that controls the branching process is lacking.\n We have developed a deterministic, spatio-temporal differential-equation based model of the core signaling network that governs lung branching morphogenesis.\n The model focuses on the two key signaling factors that have been identified in experiments, fibroblast growth factor (FGF10) and sonic hedgehog (SHH) as well as the SHH receptor patched (Ptc).\n We show that the reported biochemical interactions give rise to a Schnakenberg-type Turing patterning mechanisms that allows us to reproduce experimental observations in wildtype and mutant mice.\n The kinetic parameters as well as the domain shape are based on experimental data where available.\n The developed model is robust to small absolute and large relative changes in the parameter values.\n At the same time there is a strong regulatory potential in that the switching between branching modes can be achieved by targeted changes in the parameter values.\n We note that the sequence of different branching events may also be the result of different growth speeds: fast growth triggers lateral branching while slow growth favours bifurcations in our model.\n We conclude that the FGF10-SHH-Ptc1 module is sufficient to generate pattern that correspond to the observed branching modes.\n","id":"PMC3280966","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Denis","surname":"Menshykau","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Conradin","surname":"Kraemer","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dagmar","surname":"Iber","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Edmund

Error Functions (NeONORM) Provides Robustness Against Asymmetries in Comparative Transcriptome Profiles and Avoids False Calls","abstract":"Studies on high-throughput global gene expression using microarray technology have generated ever larger amounts of systematic transcriptome data.\n A major challenge in exploiting these heterogeneous datasets is how to normalize the expression profiles by inter-assay methods.\n Different non-linear and linear normalization methods have been developed, which essentially rely on the hypothesis that the true or perceived logarithmic fold-change distributions between two different assays are symmetric in nature.\n However, asymmetric gene expression changes are frequently observed, leading to suboptimal normalization results and in consequence potentially to thousands of false calls.\n Therefore, we have specifically investigated asymmetric comparative transcriptome profiles and developed the normalization using weighted negative second order exponential error functions (NeONORM) for robust and global inter-assay normalization.\n NeONORM efficiently damps true gene regulatory events in order to minimize their misleading impact on the normalization process.\n We evaluated NeONORM’s applicability using artificial and true experimental datasets, both of which demonstrated that NeONORM could be systematically applied to inter-assay and inter-condition

We report detailed clinical and virological data for two related cases of MERS-CoV disease, after nosocomial transmission of the virus from one patient to another in a French hospital.\n\n\nMethods\nPatient 1 visited Dubai in April, 2013; patient 2 lives in France and did not travel abroad.\n\n Both patients had underlying immunosuppressive disorders.\n\n We tested specimens from the upper (nasopharyngeal swabs) or the lower (bronchoalveolar lavage, sputum) respiratory tract and whole blood, plasma, and serum specimens for MERS-CoV by real-time RT-PCR targeting the upE and Orf1A genes of MERS-CoV.\n\n\nFindings\nInitial clinical presentation included fever, chills, and myalgia in both patients, and for patient 1, diarrhoea.\n\n Respiratory symptoms rapidly became predominant with acute respiratory failure leading to mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).\n\n Both patients developed acute renal failure.\n\n MERS-CoV was detected in lower respiratory tract specimens with high viral load (eg, cycle threshold [Ct] values of 22·9 for upE and 24 for Orf1a for a bronchoalveolar lavage sample from patient 1; Ct values of 22·5 for upE and 23·9 for Orf1a for an induced sputum sample from patient 2), whereas nasopharyngeal specimens were weakly positive or inconclusive.\n\n The two patients shared the same room for 3

the Middle East as the causative agent of a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) resembling the illness caused by SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV).\n Although derived from the CoV family, the two viruses are genetically distinct and do not use the same receptor.\n Here, we investigated whether HCoV-EMC and SARS-CoV induce similar or distinct host responses after infection of a human lung epithelial cell line.\n HCoV-EMC was able to replicate as efficiently as SARS-CoV in Calu-3 cells and similarly induced minimal transcriptomic changes before 12 h postinfection.\n Later in infection, HCoV-EMC induced a massive dysregulation of the host transcriptome, to a much greater extent than SARS-CoV.\n Both viruses induced a similar activation of pattern recognition receptors and the interleukin 17 (IL-17) pathway, but HCoV-EMC specifically down-regulated the expression of several genes within the antigen presentation pathway, including both type I and II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes.\n This could have an important impact on the ability of the host to mount an adaptive host response.\n A unique set of 207 genes was dysregulated early and permanently throughout infection with HCoV-EMC, and was used in a computational screen to predict potential antiviral compounds, including kinase inhibitors and glucocorticoids.\n Overall, HCoV-EMC and SARS-CoV elicit distinct host gene expression responses, which might impact in vivo pathogenesis and could orient therapeutic strategies against that emergent virus.\n","id":"PMC3663187","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Laurence","surname":"Josset","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Vineet

novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12

patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission,

study\nTo observe the clinical effect of plasmapheresis on excessive inflammatory reaction and immune features in patients with severe COVID-19 at risk of ARDS.\n\n\nMaterials and methods\nIn this single-center study, we included 15 confirmed cases of COVID-19 at Masih Daneshvari Hospital, in March 2020 in Tehran, Iran.\n\n COVID-19 cases were confirmed by RT-PCR and CT imaging according to WHO guidelines.\n\n Plasmapheresis was performed to alleviate cytokine-induced ARDS.\n\n The improvement in oxygen delivery (PaO2/FiO2), total number of T cells, liver enzymes, acute reaction proteins, TNF-? and IL-6 levels were evaluated.\n\n\nResults\nInflammatory cytokine levels (TNF-?, IL-6), and acute phase reaction proteins including ferritin and CRP were high before plasmapheresis.\n\n After plasmapheresis, the levels of PaO2/FiO2, acute phase reactants, inflammatory mediators, liver enzymes and bilirubin were significantly reduced within a week (p?&lt;?0.05).\n\n In contrast, although

complication of COVID-19 most commonly resulting in respiratory failure.\n\n This ten-patient study was designed to determine the efficacy of therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) in improving oxygenation and in reducing the cytokine load in a critically ill subset of patients.\n\n\nMethods\nFive single volume plasma exchanges over eight days within a 14-day study period.\n\n In mechanically ventilated patients, oxygenation was measured via the PaO2/FiO2 (P/F) ratio and the oxygenation index (OI) daily for 14 days.\n\n Supplemental oxygen requirements were tracked daily for non-ventilated patients.\n\n\nResults\nNon-ventilated patients were liberated from supplemental oxygen after TPE.\n\n The response was rapid with an 87% average reduction in oxygenation requirements following and average time to return to room air of 5.25 days.\n\n All mechanically ventilated patients demonstrated improvement in oxygenation with a 78% average improvement in the P/F ratio and a 43% improvement

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

continuing evolution of SARS-CoV-2","abstract":"The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic started in late December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has since impacted a large portion of China and raised major global concern.\n Herein, we investigated the extent of molecular divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and other related coronaviruses.\n Although we found only 4% variability in genomic nucleotides between SARS-CoV-2 and a bat SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV; RaTG13), the difference at neutral sites was 17%, suggesting the divergence between the two viruses is much larger than previously estimated.\n Our results suggest that the development of new variations in functional sites in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike seen in SARS-CoV-2 and viruses from pangolin SARSr-CoVs are likely caused by natural selection besides recombination.\n Population genetic analyses of 103 SARS-CoV-2 genomes indicated that these viruses had two major lineages (designated L and S), that are well defined by two different SNPs that show nearly complete linkage across the viral strains sequenced to date.\n We found that L lineage was more prevalent than the S lineage within the limited patient samples we examined.\n The implication of these evolutionary changes on disease etiology remains unclear.\n These findings strongly underscores the urgent need for further comprehensive studies that combine viral genomic data, with epidemiological studies of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n","id":"PMC7107875","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xiaolu","surname":"Tang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Changcheng","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiang","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuhe","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xinmin","surname":"Yao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xinkai","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuange","surname":"Duan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yirong","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhaohui","surname":"Qian","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jie","surname":"Cui","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jian","surname":"Lu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jian","surname":"Lu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.coviro.2015.06.007","date":"1970-01-01","title":"CCR5Delta32

We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n

and/or acute respiratory distress syndrome in about 20% of infected patients.\n Computed tomography (CT) is the routine imaging technique for diagnosis and monitoring of COVID-19 pneumonia.\n Chest CT has high sensitivity for diagnosis of COVID-19, but is not universally available, requires an infected or unstable patient to be moved to the radiology unit with potential exposure of several people, necessitates proper sanification of the CT room after use and is underutilized in children and pregnant women because of concerns over radiation exposure.\n The increasing frequency of confirmed COVID-19 cases is striking, and new sensitive diagnostic tools are needed to guide clinical practice.\n Lung ultrasound (LUS) is an emerging non-invasive bedside technique that is used to diagnose interstitial lung syndrome through evaluation and quantitation of the number of B-lines, pleural irregularities and nodules or consolidations.\n In patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, LUS reveals a typical pattern of diffuse interstitial lung syndrome, characterized by multiple or confluent bilateral B-lines with spared areas, thickening of the pleural line with pleural line irregularity and peripheral consolidations.\n LUS has been found to be a promising tool for the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia, and LUS findings correlate fairly with those of chest CT scan.\n Compared with CT, LUS has several other advantages, such as lack of exposure to radiation, bedside repeatability during follow-up, low cost and easier application in low-resource settings.\n Consequently, LUS may decrease utilization of conventional diagnostic imaging resources (CT scan and chest X-ray).\n LUS may help in early diagnosis, therapeutic decisions and follow-up monitoring of COVID-19 pneumonia, particularly in the critical care setting and in pregnant women, children and patients in areas with high rates of community

virus detection.\n\n\nMethods\nWe compared seven published real-time RT–PCR assays and two new assays that we have developed.\n\n To determine the analytical sensitivity of each assay, we constructed a synthetic universal control ribonucleic acid (uncRNA) containing all of the assays’ target regions on one RNA strand and spiked human blood or urine with known quantities of African or Asian Zika virus strains.\n\n Viral loads in 33 samples from Zika virus-infected patients were determined by using one of the new assays.\n\n\nFindings\nOligonucleotides of the published real-time RT–PCR assays, showed up to 10 potential mismatches with the Asian lineage causing the current outbreak, compared with 0 to 4 mismatches for the new assays.\n\n The 95% lower detection limit of the seven most sensitive assays ranged from 2.1 to 12.1 uncRNA copies/reaction.\n\n Two assays had lower sensitivities of 17.0 and 1373.3 uncRNA copies/reaction and showed a similar sensitivity when using spiked samples.\n\n The mean viral loads in samples from Zika virus-infected patients were 5?×?104 RNA copies/mL of blood and 2?×?104 RNA copies/mL of urine.\n\n\nConclusion\nWe provide reagents and updated protocols for Zika virus detection suitable for the current outbreak strains.\n\n Some published assays might be unsuitable for Zika virus detection, due to the limited sensitivity and potential incompatibility with some strains.\n\n Viral concentrations in the clinical samples were close to the technical detection limit, suggesting that the use of insensitive assays will cause false-negative results.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5153932","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Victor

SARS-coronavirus acquired during the early stages of human-to-human transmission","abstract":"id='Par1'>A 29 nucleotide deletion in open reading frame 8 (ORF8) is the most obvious genetic change in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) during its emergence in humans.\n In spite of intense study, it remains unclear whether the deletion actually reflects adaptation to humans.\n Here we engineered full, partially deleted (?29?nt), and fully deleted ORF8 into a SARS-CoV infectious cDNA clone, strain Frankfurt-1. Replication of the resulting viruses was compared in primate cell cultures as well as Rhinolophus bat cells made permissive for SARS-CoV replication by lentiviral transduction of the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor.\n Cells from cotton rat, goat, and sheep provided control scenarios that represent host systems in which SARS-CoV is neither endemic nor epidemic.\n Independent of the cell system, the truncation of ORF8 (29?nt deletion) decreased replication up to 23-fold.\n The effect was independent of the type I interferon response.\n The 29?nt deletion in SARS-CoV is a deleterious mutation acquired along the initial human-to-human transmission chain.\n The resulting loss of fitness may be due to a founder effect, which has rarely been documented in processes of viral emergence.\n These results have important implications for the retrospective assessment of the threat posed by SARS.\n","id":"PMC6181990","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Doreen","surname":"Muth","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Victor

and Sources of Endemic Human Coronaviruses","abstract":"The four endemic human coronaviruses HCoV-229E, -NL63, -OC43, and -HKU1 contribute a considerable share of upper and lower respiratory tract infections in adults and children.\n While their clinical representation resembles that of many other agents of the common cold, their evolutionary histories, and host associations could provide important insights into the natural history of past human pandemics.\n For two of these viruses, we have strong evidence suggesting an origin in major livestock species while primordial associations for all four viruses may have existed with bats and rodents.\n HCoV-NL63 and -229E may originate from bat reservoirs as assumed for many other coronaviruses, but HCoV-OC43 and -HKU1 seem more likely to have speciated from rodent-associated viruses.\n HCoV-OC43 is thought to have emerged from ancestors in domestic animals such as cattle or swine.\n The bovine coronavirus has been suggested to be a possible ancestor, from which HCoV-OC43 may have emerged in the context of a pandemic recorded historically at the end of the 19th century.\n New data suggest that HCoV-229E may actually be transferred from dromedary camels similar to Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus.\n This scenario provides important ecological parallels to the present prepandemic pattern of host associations of the MERS coronavirus.\n","id":"PMC7112090","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Victor

Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China","abstract":"Background\nSince December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and

in adult acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have been inconclusive about effects on mortality, which is very high in this population.\n\n Uncertainty also exists about the associated risk of ICU-acquired weakness.\n\n\nMethods\nWe conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis.\n\n We searched the Cochrane (Central) database, MEDLINE, EMBASE, ACP Journal Club, and clinical trial registries for randomized trials investigating survival effects of neuromuscular blocking agents in adults with ARDS.\n\n Two independent reviewers abstracted data and assessed methodologic quality.\n\n Primary study investigators provided additional unpublished data.\n\n\nResults\nThree trials (431 patients; 20 centers; all from the same research group in France) met inclusion criteria for this review.\n\n All trials assessed 48-hour infusions of cisatracurium besylate.\n\n Short-term infusion of cisatracurium besylate was associated with lower hospital mortality (RR, 0.72; 95% CI,

to imprecise interpretations.\n We discuss the strengths and limitations of VFDs and other “failure-free day” composites, and we provide a framework for when and how to use these outcome measures.\n We also provide a comprehensive discussion of the different analytic methods for analyzing and interpreting VFDs, including Student’s t tests and rank-sum tests, as well as competing risk regressions

the effect size of an intervention, a statistical test and measure of confidence with the ability to adjust for baseline factors and allow interim monitoring for trials.\n We emphasize that any

PRISM score prior to NB-BAL, observations at the time of NB-BAL and arterial blood gases, oxygenation index (OI), ventilator settings, haemodynamic variables and temperature taken at 1 h before, and 1 and 6 h after NB-BAL, were retrieved from the archived computerised database.\n Results: Median age was 7 months (IQR 2.8–43 months) and median weight was 5.5 kg (IQR 4–14 kg).\n Four (7%) patients exhibited significant immediate complications, requiring escalation of respiratory or haemodynamic support.\n Forty-two (70%) patients had complete data for calculation of OI; there was no significant change in median OI at 1 and 6 h after NB-BAL.\n However 5 (12%) of these patients experienced an increase in OI of between 10 and 45 at 1 h post NB-BAL, which returned to baseline at 6 h post NB-BAL.\n Complications did not correlate with any of the available variables: baseline OI, PRISM score or with deterioration at the time of the procedure, although it was observed that four out of the six patients with baseline OIs of greater than 20 experienced complications.\n Conclusion: Non-bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage in critically ill mechanically ventilated neonates and children is generally a well-tolerated procedure, but for some patients, in whom it was not possible to elucidate predictive factors, complications developed.\n All patients, particularly those with OIs of greater than 20, require careful monitoring during and after the procedure.\n","id":"PMC7095174","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Margarita","surname":"Burmester","email":"margivan@hotmail.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Quen","surname":"Mok","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1097/PCC.0000000000000435","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Nonpulmonary Treatments for Pediatric Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome: Proceedings From the Pediatric Acute Lung Injury Consensus Conference","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1542/peds.2008-1987","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Functional Status Scale: new pediatric outcome measure","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.3389/fped.2016.00051","date":"2016-05-02","title":"Relevant Outcomes in Pediatric Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Studies","abstract":"Despite distinct epidemiology and outcomes, pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (PARDS) is often managed based on evidence extrapolated from treatment of adults.\n The impact of non-pulmonary processes on mortality as well as the lower mortality rate compared to adults with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) renders the utilization of short-term mortality as a primary outcome measure for interventional studies problematic.\n However, data regarding alternatives to mortality are profoundly understudied, and proposed alternatives, such as ventilator-free days, may be themselves subject to hidden biases.\n Given the neuropsychiatric and functional impairment in adult survivors of ARDS, characterization of these morbidities in children with PARDS is of paramount importance.\n The purpose of this review is to frame these challenges in the context of the existing pediatric literature, and using adult ARDS as a guide, suggest potential clinically relevant outcomes that deserve further investigation.\n The goal is to identify important areas of study in order to better define clinical practice and facilitate future interventional trials in PARDS.\n","id":"PMC4865511","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Nadir","surname":"Yehya","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Neal J.","surname":"Thomas","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1136/thorax.55.7.587","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Pediatric origins of adult lung disease. 1.

familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China,

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile

recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like

coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7159299","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Chaolin","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yeming","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xingwang","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lili","surname":"Ren","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jianping","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Li","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guohui","surname":"Fan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiuyang","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoying","surname":"Gu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhenshun","surname":"Cheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiaan","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wenjuan","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuelei","surname":"Xie","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wen","surname":"Yin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Min","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yan","surname":"Xiao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Li","surname":"Guo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jungang","surname":"Xie","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guangfa","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rongmeng","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhancheng","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Jin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jianwei","surname":"Wang","email":"wangjw28@163.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Cao","email":"caobin_ben@163.com","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical

synthesis","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>The COVID-19 pandemic has placed an unprecedented strain on health systems, with rapidly increasing demand for healthcare in hospitals and intensive care units (ICUs) worldwide.\n\n As the pandemic escalates, determining the resulting needs for healthcare resources (beds, staff, equipment) has become a key priority for many countries.\n\n Projecting future demand requires estimates of how long patients with COVID-19 need different levels of hospital care.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>We performed a systematic review of early evidence on length of stay (LoS) of patients with COVID-19 in hospital and in ICU.\n\n We subsequently developed a method to generate LoS distributions which combines summary statistics reported in multiple studies, accounting for differences in sample sizes.\n\n Applying this approach, we provide distributions for total hospital and ICU LoS from studies in China and elsewhere, for use by the community.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>We identified 52 studies, the majority from China (46/52).\n\n Median hospital LoS ranged from 4 to 53 days within China, and 4 to 21 days outside of China, across 45 studies.\n\n ICU LoS was reported by eight studies—four each within and outside China—with median values ranging from 6 to 12 and 4 to 19 days, respectively.\n\n Our summary distributions have a median hospital LoS of 14 (IQR 10–19) days for China, compared with 5 (IQR 3–9) days outside of China.\n\n For ICU, the summary distributions are more similar (median (IQR) of 8 (5–13) days for China and 7 (4–11) days outside of China).\n\n There was a visible difference by discharge status, with patients who were discharged alive having longer LoS than those who died during their admission, but no trend associated with study date.\n\n\nConclusion\nid='Par4'>Patients with COVID-19 in China appeared to remain in hospital for longer than elsewhere.\n\n This may be explained by differences in criteria for admission and discharge between countries, and different timing within the pandemic.\n\n In the absence of local data, the combined summary LoS distributions provided here can be used to model bed demands for contingency planning and then updated, with the novel method presented here, as more studies with aggregated statistics emerge outside China.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7467845","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Eleanor

in several studies on China as 10?13 days.\n\n Global studies have indicated that the length of hospitalisation depends on different factors, such as the time elapsed from exposure to symptom onset, and from symptom onset to hospital admission, as well as specificities of the country under study.\n\n The goal of this paper is to identify factors associated with the median duration of hospital stays of COVID-19 patients during the second COVID-19 wave that hit Vietnam from 5 March to 8 April 2020.\nMethod\nWe used retrospective data on 133 hospitalised patients with COVID-19 recorded over at least two weeks during the study period.\n\n The Cox proportional-hazards regression model was applied to determine the potential risk factors associated with length of hospital stay.\n\n\nResults\nThere were 65 (48.9%) females, 98 (73.7%) patients 48 years old or younger, 15 (11.3%) persons with comorbidities, 21 (16.0%) severely ill patients and 5 (3.8%) individuals with life-threatening conditions.\n\n Eighty-two (61.7%) patients were discharged after testing negative for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, 51 were still in the hospital at the end of the study period and none died.\n\n The median duration of stay in a hospital was 21 (IQR: 16–34) days.\n\n The multivariable Cox regression model showed that age, residence and sources of contamination were significantly associated with longer duration of hospitalisation.\n\n\nConclusion\nA close look at how long COVID-19 patients stayed in the hospital could provide an overview of their treatment process in Vietnam, and support the country's National Steering Committee on COVID-19 Prevention and Control in the efficient allocation of resources over the next stages of the COVID-19 prevention

role and response of primary healthcare services in the delivery of palliative care in epidemics and pandemics: A rapid review to inform practice and service delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic","abstract":"Background:\nThe increased number of deaths in the community happening as a result of COVID-19 has caused primary healthcare services to change their traditional service delivery in a short timeframe.\n\n Services are quickly adapting to new challenges in the practical delivery of end-of-life care to patients in the community including through virtual consultations and in the provision of timely symptom control.\n\n\nAim:\nTo synthesise existing evidence related to the delivery of palliative and end-of-life care by primary healthcare professionals in epidemics and pandemics.\n\n\nDesign:\nRapid systematic review using modified systematic review methods, with narrative synthesis of the evidence.\n\n\nData sources:\nSearches were carried out in Medline, Embase, PsychINFO, CINAHL and Web of Science on 7th March 2020.\nResults:\nOnly five studies met the inclusion criteria, highlighting a striking lack of evidence base for the response of primary healthcare services in palliative care during epidemics and pandemics.\n\n All were observational studies.\n\n Findings were synthesised using a pandemic response framework according to ‘systems’ (community providers feeling disadvantaged in terms of receiving timely information and protocols), ‘space’ (recognised need for more care in the community), ‘staff’ (training needs and resilience) and ‘stuff’ (other aspects of managing care in pandemics including personal protective equipment, cleaning care settings and access to investigations).\n\n\nConclusions:\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic progresses, there is an urgent need for research to provide increased understanding of the role of primary care and community nursing services in palliative care, alongside hospices and community specialist palliative care providers.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7528540","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Sarah","surname":"Mitchell","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Victoria","surname":"Maynard","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Victoria","surname":"Maynard","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Victoria","surname":"Lyons","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nicholas","surname":"Jones","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Clare","surname":"Gardiner","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1370/afm.2557","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Redesigning

of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing

infections and immune responses","abstract":"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are by far the largest group of known positive?sense RNA viruses having an extensive range of natural hosts.\n In the past few decades, newly evolved Coronaviruses have posed a global threat to public health.\n The immune response is essential to control and eliminate CoV infections, however, maladjusted immune responses may result in immunopathology and impaired pulmonary gas exchange.\n Gaining a deeper understanding of the interaction between Coronaviruses and the innate immune systems of the hosts may shed light on the development and persistence of inflammation in the lungs and hopefully can reduce the risk of lung inflammation caused by CoVs.\n In this review, we provide an update on CoV infections and relevant diseases, particularly the host defense against CoV?induced inflammation of lung tissue, as well as the role of the innate immune system in the pathogenesis and clinical treatment.\n","id":"PMC7166547","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Geng","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yaohua","surname":"Fan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yaohua","surname":"Fan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yanni","surname":"Lai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yanni","surname":"Lai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tiantian","surname":"Han","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tiantian","surname":"Han","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zonghui","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zonghui","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peiwen","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peiwen","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Pan","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Pan","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wenbiao","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wenbiao","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dingwen","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dingwen","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaohong","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaohong","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qiwei","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qiwei","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jianguo","surname":"Wu","email":"jwu898@jnu.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jianguo","surname":"Wu","email":"jwu898@jnu.edu.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Pathogenic
