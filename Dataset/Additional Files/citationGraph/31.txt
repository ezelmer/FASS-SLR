Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship

pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese

Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7121484","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Qun","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuhua","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoye","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yeqing","surname":"Tong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ruiqi","surname":"Ren","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kathy S.M.","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Eric H.Y.","surname":"Lau","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jessica Y.","surname":"Wong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuesen","surname":"Xing","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nijuan","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chao","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tian","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Man","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wenxiao","surname":"Tu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chuding","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lianmei","surname":"Jin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rui","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Suhua","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rui","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yinbo","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ge","surname":"Shao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhongfa","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhiqiang","surname":"Deng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Boxi","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhitao","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yanping","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guoqing","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tommy T.Y.","surname":"Lam","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Joseph T.","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"George F.","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Benjamin J.","surname":"Cowling","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gabriel M.","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zijian","surname":"Feng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"30 January 2020 pneumonia epidemic situation of C SARS-CoV-2 infection in Hubei province, China-Hubei Provincial Health Committee","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"4 February 2020 pneumonia epidemic situation of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Hubei province, China-Hubei Provincial Health Committee","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30211-7","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study","abstract":"Background\nIn December, 2019, a pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China.\n\n We aimed to further clarify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020.

Factors associated with proven or possible HRV pneumonia at the first HRV detection were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analysis.\n\n We then characterized all episodes of proven and

Clinical Evaluation of the Luminex Aries Flu A/B &amp; RSV Assay for Pediatric and Adult Respiratory Tract Specimens","abstract":"Influenza A and B viruses and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are three common viruses implicated in seasonal respiratory tract infections and are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in adults and children worldwide.\n In recent years, an increasing number of commercial molecular tests have become available to diagnose respiratory viral infections.\n The Luminex Aries Flu A/B &amp; RSV assay is a fully automated sample-to-answer molecular diagnostic assay for the detection of influenza A, influenza B, and RSV.\n The clinical performance of the Aries Flu A/B &amp; RSV assay was prospectively evaluated in comparison to that of the Luminex xTAG respiratory viral panel (RVP) at four North American clinical institutions over a 2-year period.\n Of the 2,479 eligible nasopharyngeal swab specimens included in the prospective study, 2,371 gave concordant results between the assays.\n One hundred eight specimens generated results that were discordant with those from the xTAG RVP and were further analyzed by bidirectional sequencing.\n Final clinical sensitivity values of the Aries Flu A/B &amp; RSV assay were 98.1% for influenza A virus, 98.0% for influenza B virus, and 97.7% for RSV.\n Final clinical specificities for all three pathogens ranged from 98.6% to 99.8%.\n Due to the low prevalence of influenza B, an additional 40 banked influenza B-positive specimens were tested at the participating clinical laboratories and were all accurately detected by the Aries Flu A/B &amp; RSV assay.\n This study demonstrates that the Aries Flu A/B &amp; RSV assay is a suitable method for rapid and accurate identification of these causative pathogens in respiratory infections.\n","id":"PMC5527421","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Stefan","surname":"Juretschko","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"James","surname":"Mahony","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Richard

for Chest Radiographic Interpretation","abstract":"Purpose\nTo study the extent of pulmonary involvement in coronavirus 19 (COVID-19) with quantitative CT and to assess the impact of disease burden on opacity visibility on chest radiographs.\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\nThis retrospective study included 20 pairs of CT scans and same-day chest radiographs from 17 patients with COVID-19, along with 20 chest radiographs of controls.\n\n All pulmonary opacities were semiautomatically segmented on CT images, producing an anteroposterior projection image to match the corresponding frontal chest radiograph.\n\n The quantitative CT lung opacification mass (QCTmass) was defined as (opacity attenuation value + 1000 HU)/1000 × 1.065 (g/mL) × combined volume (cm3) of the individual opacities.\n\n Eight thoracic radiologists reviewed the 40 radiographs, and a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed for the detection of lung opacities.\n\n Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors affecting opacity visibility on chest radiographs.\n\n\nResults\nThe mean QCTmass per patient was 72.4 g ± 120.8 (range, 0.7–420.7 g), and opacities occupied 3.2% ± 5.8 (range, 0.1%–19.8%) and 13.9% ± 18.0 (range, 0.5%–57.8%) of the lung area on the CT images and projected images, respectively.\n\n The radiographs had a median sensitivity of 25% and specificity of 90% among radiologists.\n\n Nineteen of 186 opacities were visible on chest radiographs, and a median area of 55.8% of the projected images was identifiable on radiographs.\n\n Logistic regression analysis showed that QCTmass (P &lt; .\n\n001) and combined opacity volume (P &lt; .\n\n001) significantly affected opacity visibility on radiographs.\n\n\nConclusion\nQCTmass varied among patients with COVID-19. Chest radiographs had high specificity for detecting lung opacities in COVID-19 but a low sensitivity.\n\n QCTmass and combined opacity volume were significant determinants of opacity visibility on radiographs.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7233433","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Hyewon","surname":"Choi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaolong","surname":"Qi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaolong","surname":"Qi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Soon Ho","surname":"Yoon","email":"yshoka@gmail.com","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Soon Ho","surname":"Yoon","email":"yshoka@gmail.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sang Joon","surname":"Park","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Sang Joon","surname":"Park","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kyung Hee","surname":"Lee","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Kyung Hee","surname":"Lee","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jin Yong","surname":"Kim","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jin Yong","surname":"Kim","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Young Kyung","surname":"Lee","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Young Kyung","surname":"Lee","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hongseok","surname":"Ko","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Hongseok","surname":"Ko","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ki Hwan","surname":"Kim","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Ki Hwan","surname":"Kim","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chang Min","surname":"Park","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Chang Min","surname":"Park","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yun-Hyeon","surname":"Kim","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Yun-Hyeon","surname":"Kim","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Junqiang","surname":"Lei","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Junqiang","surname":"Lei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jung Hee","surname":"Hong","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Jung Hee","surname":"Hong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hyungjin","surname":"Kim","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Hyungjin","surname":"Kim","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Eui Jin","surname":"Hwang","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Eui Jin","surname":"Hwang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Seung Jin","surname":"Yoo","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Seung Jin","surname":"Yoo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ju Gang","surname":"Nam","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Ju Gang","surname":"Nam","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chang Hyun","surname":"Lee","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Chang Hyun","surname":"Lee","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jin Mo","surname":"Goo","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"                          Jin Mo","surname":"Goo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References depth 1":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A novel coronavirus from patients with pneumonia in China, 2019","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30183-5","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41);

2019 presented with fever, cough, and dyspnea accompanied by complications of acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n Chest radiography revealed diffuse opacities and consolidation.\n\n One of these patients died.\n\n Sequence results revealed the presence of a previously unknown ?-CoV strain in all five patients, with 99.8% to 99.9% nucleotide identities among the isolates.\n\n These isolates showed 79.0% nucleotide identity with the sequence of SARS-CoV (GenBank NC_004718) and 51.8% identity with the sequence of MERS-CoV (GenBank NC_019843).\n\n The virus is phylogenetically closest to a bat SARS-like CoV (SL-ZC45, GenBank MG772933) with 87.6% to 87.7% nucleotide identity, but is in a separate clade.\n\n Moreover, these viruses have a single intact open reading frame gene 8, as a further indicator of bat-origin CoVs.\n\n However, the amino acid sequence of the tentative receptor-binding domain resembles that of SARS-CoV, indicating that these viruses might use the same receptor.\n\n\nConclusion\nA novel bat-borne CoV was identified that is associated with severe and fatal respiratory disease in humans.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7147275","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Li-Li","surname":"Ren","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ye-Ming","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhi-Qiang","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zi-Chun","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Li","surname":"Guo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Teng","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong-Zhong","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yan","surname":"Xiong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong-Jun","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xing-Wang","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guo-Hui","surname":"Fan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiao-Ying","surname":"Gu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yan","surname":"Xiao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiu-Yang","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fan","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xin-Ming","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chao","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lan","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi-Wei","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jian","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiao-Rui","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jie","surname":"Dong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Li","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chao-Lin","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jian-Ping","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhen-Shun","surname":"Cheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin-Lin","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Hui","surname":"Qian","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chuan","surname":"Qin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Jin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Cao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jian-Wei","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiu-Yuan","surname":"Hao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiu-Yuan","surname":"Hao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Pei-Fang","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1038/s41586-020-2008-3","date":"2020-01-28","title":"A

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

pneumonia.\n\n\nPurpose\nTo determine the change in chest CT findings associated with COVID-19 pneumonia from initial diagnosis until patient recovery.\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\nThis retrospective review included patients with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 infection presenting between 12 January 2020 to 6 February 2020. Patients with severe respiratory distress and/ or oxygen requirement at any time during the disease course were excluded.\n\n Repeat Chest CT was obtained at approximately 4 day intervals.\n\n The total CT score was the sum of lung involvement (5 lobes, score 1-5 for each lobe, range, 0 none, 25 maximum) was determined.\n\n\nResults\nTwenty one patients (6 males and 15 females, age 25-63 years) with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated.\n\n These patients under went a total of 82 pulmonary CT scans with a mean interval of 4±1 days (range: 1-8 days).\n\n All patients were discharged after a mean hospitalized period of 17±4 days (range: 11-26 days).\n\n Maximum lung involved peaked at approximately 10 days (with the calculated total CT score of 6) from the onset of initial symptoms (R2=0.25), p&lt;0.001).\n\n Based on quartiles of patients from day 0 to day 26 involvement, 4 stages of lung CT were defined: Stage 1 (0-4 days): ground glass opacities (GGO) in 18/24 (75%) patients with the total CT score of 2±2; (2)Stage-2 (5-8d days): increased crazy-paving pattern 9/17 patients (53%) with a increase in total CT score (6±4, p=0.002); (3) Stage-3 (9-13days): consolidation 19/21 (91%) patients with the peak of total CT score (7±4); (4) Stage-4 (?14 days): gradual resolution of consolidation 15/20 (75%) patients with a decreased total CT score (6±4) without crazy-paving pattern.\n\n\nConclusion\nIn patients recovering from COVID-19 pneumonia (without severe respiratory distress during the disease course), lung abnormalities on chest CT showed greatest severity approximately 10 days after initial onset of symptoms.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7233367","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Feng","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tianhe","surname":"Ye","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tianhe","surname":"Ye","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shan","surname":"Gui","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shan","surname":"Gui","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Liang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Liang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lingli","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lingli","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dandan","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dandan","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiazheng","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiazheng","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Richard

multi-center study","abstract":"Objectives\nRapid and accurate diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is critical during the epidemic.\n\n We aim to identify differences in CT imaging and clinical manifestations between pneumonia patients with and without COVID-19, and to develop and validate a diagnostic model for COVID-19 based on radiological semantic and clinical features alone.\n\n\nMethods\nA consecutive cohort of 70 COVID-19 and 66 non-COVID-19 pneumonia patients were retrospectively recruited from five institutions.\n\n Patients were divided into primary (n?=?98) and validation (n?=?38) cohorts.\n\n The chi-square test, Student’s t test, and Kruskal-Wallis H test were performed, comparing 1745 lesions and 67 features in the two groups.\n\n Three models were constructed using radiological semantic and clinical features through multivariate logistic regression.\n\n Diagnostic efficacies of developed models were quantified by receiver operating characteristic curve.\n\n Clinical usage was evaluated by decision curve analysis and nomogram.\n\n\nResults\nEighteen radiological semantic features and seventeen clinical features were identified to be significantly different.\n\n Besides ground-glass opacities (p?=?0.032) and consolidation (p?=?0.001) in the lung periphery, the lesion size (1–3 cm) is also significant for the diagnosis of COVID-19 (p?=?0.027).\n\n Lung score presents no significant difference (p?=?0.417).\n\n Three diagnostic models achieved an area under the curve value as high as 0.986 (95% CI 0.966~1.000).\n\n The clinical and radiological semantic models provided a better diagnostic performance and more considerable net benefits.\n\n\nConclusions\nBased on CT imaging and clinical manifestations alone, the pneumonia patients with and without COVID-19 can be distinguished.\n\n A model composed of radiological semantic and clinical features has an excellent performance for the diagnosis of COVID-19.\nKey Points\n\n• Based on CT imaging and clinical manifestations alone, the pneumonia patients with and without COVID-19 can be distinguished.\n\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version

correlates could thus prove useful for the automated diagnosis of ASD.\n\n Radiomic analyses based on MRI texture features have shown a great potential for characterizing differences occurring from

paper proposes the study of texture features based on grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) as a means for characterizing differences between ASD and development control (DC) subjects.\n\n Our study uses 64 T1-weighted MRI scans acquired from two groups of subjects: 28 typical age range subjects 4–15 years old (14 ASD and 14 DC, age-matched), and 36 non-typical age range subjects 10–24 years old (20 ASD and 16 DC).\n\n GLCM matrices are computed from manually labeled hippocampus and amygdala regions, and then encoded as texture features by applying 11 standard Haralick quantifier functions.\n\n Significance tests are performed to identify texture differences between ASD and DC subjects.\n\n An analysis using SVM and random forest classifiers is then carried out to find the most discriminative features, and use these features for classifying ASD from DC subjects.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par2'>Preliminary results show that all 11 features derived from the hippocampus (typical

in Healthy Older Adults Are Differentially Related to Macro- and Microstructural White Matter Characteristics of the Cerebral Lobes","abstract":"Aging is associated with microstructural white matter (WM) changes.\n WM microstructural characteristics, measured with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), are different in normal appearing white matter (NAWM) and WM hyperintensities (WMH).\n It is largely unknown how the microstructural properties of WMH are associated with cognition and if there are regional effects for specific cognitive domains.\n We therefore examined within 200 healthy older participants (a) differences in microstructural characteristics of NAWM and WMH per cerebral lobe; and (b) the association of macrostructural (WMH volume) and microstructural characteristics (within NAWM and WMH separately) of each lobe with measures of executive function and processing speed.\n Multi-modal imaging (i.\ne.\n, T1, DTI, and FLAIR) was used to assess WM properties.\n The Stroop and the Trail Making Test were used to measure inhibition, task-switching (both components of executive function), and processing speed.\n We observed that age was associated with deterioration of white matter microstructure of the NAWM, most notably in the frontal lobe.\n Older participants had larger WMH volumes and lowest fractional anisotropy values within WMH were found in the frontal lobe.\n Task-switching was associated with cerebral NAWM volume and NAWM volume of all lobes.\n Processing speed was associated with total NAWM volume, and microstructural properties of parietal NAWM, the parietal WMH, and the temporal NAWM.\n Task-switching was related to microstructural properties of WMH of the frontal lobe and WMH volume of the parietal lobe.\n Our results confirm that executive functioning and processing speed are uniquely associated with macro- and microstructural properties of NAWM and WMH.\n We further demonstrate for the first time that these relationships differ by lobar region.\n This warrants the consideration of these distinct WM indices when investigating cognitive function.\n","id":"PMC5715235","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Sarah","surname":"Hirsiger","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Vincent","surname":"Koppelmans","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Susan","surname":"Mérillat","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Cornelia","surname":"Erdin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Atul","surname":"Narkhede","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Adam

White Matter Hyperintensities as Inter-Dependent Processes","abstract":"Microstructural changes of White Matter (WM) associated with aging have been widely described through Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) parameters.\n In parallel, White Matter Hyperintensities (WMH) as observed on a T2-weighted MRI are extremely common in older individuals.\n However, few studies have investigated both phenomena conjointly.\n The present study investigates aging effects on DTI parameters in absence and in presence of WMH.\n Diffusion maps were constructed based on 21 directions DTI scans of young adults (n = 19, mean age = 33 SD = 7.4) and two age-matched groups of older adults, one presenting low-level-WMH (n = 20, mean age = 78, SD = 3.2) and one presenting high-level-WMH (n = 20, mean age = 79, SD = 5.4).\n Older subjects with low-level-WMH presented modifications of DTI parameters in comparison to younger subjects, fitting with the DTI pattern classically described in aging, i.\ne.\n, Fractional Anisotropy (FA) decrease/Radial Diffusivity (RD) increase.\n Furthermore, older subjects with high-level-WMH showed higher DTI modifications in Normal Appearing White Matter (NAWM) in comparison to those with low-level-WMH.\n Finally, in older subjects with high-level-WMH, FA, and RD values of NAWM were associated with to WMH burden.\n Therefore, our findings suggest that DTI modifications and the presence of WMH would be two inter-dependent processes but occurring within different temporal windows.\n DTI changes would reflect the early phase of white matter changes and WMH would appear as a consequence of those changes.\n","id":"PMC4718031","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Amandine","surname":"Pelletier","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Olivier","surname":"Periot","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Bixente","surname":"Dilharreguy","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Bassem","surname":"Hiba","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Martine","surname":"Bordessoules","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sandra","surname":"Chanraud","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Karine","surname":"Pérès","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hélène","surname":"Amieva","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jean-François","surname":"Dartigues","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Michèle","surname":"Allard","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gwénaëlle","surname":"Catheline","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1161/STROKEAHA.110.596056","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Leukoaraiosis

of Pulmonary Adenocarcinomas Appearing as Pulmonary Ground-Glass Nodules","abstract":"Background\n It is important to distinguish the classification of lung adenocarcinoma.\n\n A radiomics model was developed to predict tumor invasiveness using quantitative and qualitative features of pulmonary ground-glass nodules (GGNs) on chest CT.\n\n\n Materials and Methods\n A total of 599 GGNs [including 202 preinvasive lesions and 397 minimally invasive and invasive pulmonary adenocarcinomas (IPAs)] were evaluated using univariate, multivariate, and logistic regression analyses to construct a radiomics model that predicted invasiveness of GGNs.\n\n In primary cohort (comprised of patients scanned from August 2012 to July 2016), preinvasive lesions were distinguished from IPAs based on pure or mixed density (PM), lesion shape, lobulated border, and pleural retraction and 35 other quantitative parameters (P &lt;0.05) using univariate analysis.\n\n Multivariate analysis showed that PM, lobulated border, pleural retraction, age, and fractal dimension (FD) were significantly different between preinvasive lesions and IPAs.\n\n After logistic regression analysis, PM and FD were used to develop a prediction nomogram.\n\n The validation cohort was comprised of patients scanned after Jan 2016.\n Results\nThe model showed good discrimination between preinvasive lesions and IPAs with an area under curve (AUC) of 0.76 [95% CI: 0.71 to 0.80] in ROC curve for the primary cohort.\n\n The nomogram also demonstrated good discrimination in the validation cohort with an AUC of 0.79 [95% CI: 0.71 to 0.88].\n\n\n Conclusions\n For GGNs, PM, lobulated border, pleural retraction, age, and FD were features discriminating preinvasive lesions from IPAs.\n\n The radiomics model based upon PM and FD may predict the invasiveness of pulmonary adenocarcinomas appearing as GGNs.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6020660","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xing","surname":"Xue","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yong","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Yong","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qiang","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Feng","surname":"Cui","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Feng","surname":"Cui","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuqing","surname":"Lian","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Siying","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Siying","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Linpeng","surname":"Yao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Peng","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Peng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xin","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xin","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peipei","surname":"Pang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jianhua","surname":"Yan","email":"jianhua.yan@gmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Feng","surname":"Chen","email":"chenfenghz@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Feng","surname":"Chen","email":"chenfenghz@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1053/j.semnuclmed.2018.07.003","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Applications

leucoaraiosis: a review","abstract":"Leucoaraiosis (LA), also referred to as white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), are usually seen as patchy or confluent hyperintense areas on T2-weighted or fluid-attenuated inversion recovery MRI in the elderly.\n It is often asymptomatic in its early stages, yet its persistent evolution to more advanced stages may lead to substantial neurological dysfunction including dementia, stroke and death.\n Despite its clinical significance, the pathogenic mechanisms underlying LA development are uncertain.\n In patients with LA, the pathophysiological changes in white matter (WM) are suggested to be continuous from WMHs to its neighbourhood ‘normal-appearing white matter (NAWM)’ on conventional MRI sequences.\n Multimodal imaging studies revealed that the so-called ‘NAWM’ was actually abnormal with regard to underlying haemodynamic and microstructural changes.\n On the basis of positron emission tomography CT, xenon-CT, perfusion MRI, etc, the cerebral blood flow of NAWM was found to be significantly reduced in patients with LA, compared with healthy controls.\n Meanwhile, the integrity of microstructures and blood–brain barrier in NAWM was also demonstrated to be impaired with diffusion tensor imaging and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI studies, respectively.\n In addition,the integrity of NAWM correlated much stronger with cognitive performance than did WMHs load.\n It is reasonable to assume that the subtle injury of NAWM would be more reversible than WMHs themselves.\n Therefore, multimodal imaging modalities could be appropriately applied to future interventional studies targeting at early pathophysiological changes of NAWM.\n In this paper, we summarise current knowledge about NAWM of LA mainly acquired from multimodal imaging studies in vivo, and attempt to give options for future work.\n","id":"PMC5435207","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Genlong","surname":"Zhong","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Min","surname":"Lou","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Das

have the potential to improve cartilage recovery and ultimately restore healthy joints.\n However, despite currently available therapies and advances in research, unfulfilled medical needs persist for OA treatment.\n In this review, we focused on the contents of non-cellular and cellular therapies for OA, and briefly summarized the results of clinical trials for cell-based OA therapy to lay a solid

Particularly important are those studies that examine this issue in young unaffected adults and children before the development of disease.\n Despite some variation across studies, women appear for the most part to have a thinner and more reduced volume of cartilage in the knee than men, and this may occur from early childhood.\n It is not clear whether women have a more accelerated rate of cartilage volume loss than men.\n Few data exist on sex differences in systemic biomarkers of joint metabolism.\n In these studies, it is critically important to characterize the total body burden of OA and the presence of comorbid conditions likely to influence a given biomarker.\n Lastly, future research should dovetail studies of sex differences in imaging and biochemical biomarkers with

on the clinical observation, males and females have different prevalence rates and severity levels of OA.\n Thus, sex-based differences may play essential roles in OA’s prognosis and treatment outcomes.\n To date, the comprehensive understanding of the relationship between sex and OA is still largely lacking.\n In the current study, we analyzed a published transcriptome dataset of knee articular cartilage (GSE114007) from 18 healthy (five females, 13 males) and 20 OA (11 females, nine males) donors to provide a slight insight into this important but complex issue.\n First, comparing female healthy cartilage samples with those of males revealed 36 differential expression genes (DEGs), indicating the fundamental sex-related differences at the molecular level.\n Meanwhile, 923 DEGs were distinguished between OA and healthy female cartilage, which can be enriched to 15 Reactome pathways.\n On the other hand, when comparing OA and healthy male cartilage, there are only 419 DEGs were identified, and only six pathways were enriched against the Reactome database.\n The different signaling response to OA in the male and female cartilage was further enforced by recognizing 50 genes with significantly different OA-responsive expression fold changes in males and females.\n Particularly, 14 Reactome pathways, such as “Extracellular matrix organization”, “Collagen biosynthesis and modifying enzymes”, “Dissolution of fibrin clot”, and “Platelet Aggregation (Plug formation)”, can be noted from these 50 sex-dependent OA-responsive genes.\n Overall, the current study explores the Sex as a Biological Variable (SABV) at the transcriptomic level in the knee articular cartilage in both healthy status and OA event, which could help predict the differential OA prognosis and treatment outcome of males and female patients.\n","id":"PMC8346087","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Chenshuang","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhong","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Zhong","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nicola","surname":"Veronese","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nicola","surname":"Veronese","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nicola","surname":"Veronese","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Alfonso","surname":"Baldi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.rehab.2016.01.006","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Risk

associated with the female reproductive cycle.\n\n In this study, we investigated whether female rats are more variable than male rats in scientific reports of neuroscience-related traits.\n\n\nMethods\nPubMed and Web of Science were searched for the period from August 1, 2010, to July 31, 2014, for articles that included both male and female rats and that measured diverse aspects of brain function.\n\n Only empirical articles using both male and female gonad-intact adult rats, written in English, and including the number of subjects (or a range) were included.\n\n This resulted in 311 articles for analysis.\n\n Data were extracted from digital images from article PDFs and from manuscript tables and text.\n\n The mean and standard deviation (SD) were determined for each data point and their quotient provided a coefficient of variation (CV) as a measure of trait-specific variability for each sex.\n\n Additionally, the results were coded for the type of research being measured (behavior, electrophysiology, histology, neurochemistry, and non-brain measures) and for the strain of rat.\n\n Over 6000 data points were extracted for both males and females.\n\n Subsets of the data were coded for whether male and female mean values differed significantly and whether animals were grouped or individually housed.\n\n\nResults\nAcross all traits, there were no sex differences in trait variability, as indicated by the CV, and there were no sex differences in any of the four neuroscience categories, even in instances in which mean values for males and females were significantly different.\n\n Female rats were not more variable at any stage of the estrous cycle than male rats.\n\n There were no sex differences in the effect of housing conditions on CV.\n\n On one of four measures of non-brain function, females were more variable than males.\n\n\nConclusions\nWe conclude that even when female rats are used in neuroscience experiments without regard to the estrous cycle stage, their data are not more variable than those of male rats.\n\n This is true for behavioral, electrophysiological, neurochemical, and histological measures.\n\n Thus, when designing neuroscience experiments to include both male and female rats, power analyses based on variance in male measures are sufficient to yield accurate numbers for females as well, even when the

avoided females based on the idea that female traits are more variable than those of males because of cyclic variation in effects of ovarian hormones.\n\n\nMethods\nTo test the assumption of inherently greater female variability, we analyzed 293 microarray datasets measuring gene expression in various tissues of mice and humans, comprising analysis of more than 5 million probes.\n\n\nResults\nMeta-analysis showed that on average, male gene expression is slightly more variable than that of females although the difference is small.\n\n We also tested if the X chromosome of humans shows greater variability in gene expression in males than in females, as might be expected because of hemizygous exposure of polymorphic X alleles but again found little sex

cell.\n\n However, less than 50% of the scientific studies published in 2009 using experimental animals reported sex as a biological variable.\n\n Because every cell has a sex, we conducted a literature review to determine the extent to which sex is reported as a variable in cardiovascular studies on cultured cells.\n\n\nMethods\nArticles from 10 cardiovascular journals with high impact factors (Circulation, J Am Coll Cardiol, Eur Heart J, Circ Res, Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol, Cardiovasc Res, J Mol Cell Cardiol, Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol, J Heart Lung Transplant and J Cardiovasc Pharmacol) and published in 2010 were searched using terms 'cultured' and 'cells' in any order to determine if the sex of those cells was reported.\n\n Studies using established cell lines were excluded.\n\n\nResults\nUsing two separate search strategies, we found that only 25 of 90 articles (28%) and 20 of 101 articles (19.8%) reported the sex of cells.\n\n Of those reporting the sex of cells, most (68.9%; n = 31) used only male cells and none used exclusively female cells.\n\n In studies reporting the sex of cells of cardiovascular origin, 40% used vascular smooth-muscle cells, and 30% used stem/progenitor cells.\n\n In studies using cells of human origin, 35% did not report the sex of those cells.\n\n None of the studies using neonatal cardiac myocytes reported the sex of those cells.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe complement of sex chromosomes in cells studied in culture has the potential to affect expression of proteins and 'mechanistic' signaling pathways.\n\n Therefore, consistent with scientific excellence, editorial policies should require reporting sex of cells used in in vitro experiments.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3224776","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"K

joints such as articular cartilage, subchondral bone, synovial membrane, and ligaments.\n No therapy is currently available to completely prevent the initiation or progression of the disease partly due to poor understanding of the mechanisms of the disease pathology.\n Cartilage is the main tissue afflicted by OA, and chondrocytes, the sole cellular component in the tissue, actively participate in the degeneration process.\n Multiple factors affect the development and progression of OA including inflammation that is sustained during the progression of the disease and alteration in biomechanical conditions due to wear and tear or trauma in cartilage.\n During the progression of OA, extracellular matrix (ECM) of cartilage is actively remodeled by chondrocytes under inflammatory conditions.\n This alteration of ECM, in turn, changes the biomechanical environment of chondrocytes, which further drives the progression of the disease in the presence of inflammation.\n The changes in ECM composition and structure also prevent participation of mesenchymal stem cells in the repair process by inhibiting their chondrogenic differentiation.\n This review focuses on how inflammation-induced ECM remodeling disturbs cellular activities to prevent self-regeneration of cartilage in the pathology of OA.\n","id":"PMC3771246","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Maricela","surname":"Maldonado","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jin","surname":"Nam","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Jin","surname":"Nam","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1111/j.1365-2842.2012.02332.x","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Differential

counterparts, females experience a higher incidence of joint hypermobility syndrome (a risk factor for osteoarthritis development), and post-menopausal females experience a higher prevalence of osteoarthritis than age-matched males.\n These observations indicate that fluctuating sex hormone levels in young females and loss of ovarian sex hormone production due to menopause likely contribute to observed sex differences in knee joint function and risk for loss of function.\n In studies of osteoarthritis, however, there is a general lack of appreciation for the heterogeneity of hormonal control in both women and men.\n Progress in this field is limited by the relatively few preclinical osteoarthritis models, and that most of the work with established models uses only male animals.\n To elucidate sex differences in osteoarthritis, it is important to examine sex hormone mechanisms in cells from knee tissues and the sexual dimorphism in the role of inflammation at the cell, tissue, and organ levels.\n There is a need to determine if the risk for loss of knee function and integrity in females is restricted to only the knee or if sex-specific changes in other tissues play a

associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.\n\n Increasing quartile of NLR was statistically significantly associated with secondary outcome.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR is associated with outcomes in unselected critically ill patients.\n\n In patients with sepsis, there was no statistically significant relationship between NLR and mortality.\n\n Further investigation is required to increase understanding of the

recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like

infection presenting between 12 January 2020 to 6 February 2020. Patients with severe respiratory distress and/ or oxygen requirement at any time during the disease course were excluded.\n\n Repeat Chest CT was obtained at approximately 4 day intervals.\n\n The total CT score was the sum of lung involvement (5 lobes, score 1-5 for each lobe, range, 0 none, 25 maximum) was determined.\n\n\nResults\nTwenty one patients (6 males and 15 females, age 25-63 years) with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated.\n\n These patients under went a total of 82 pulmonary CT scans with a mean interval of 4±1 days (range: 1-8 days).\n\n All patients were discharged

virus detection.\n\n\nMethods\nWe compared seven published real-time RT–PCR assays and two new assays that we have developed.\n\n To determine the analytical sensitivity of each assay, we constructed a synthetic universal control ribonucleic acid (uncRNA) containing all of the assays’ target regions on one RNA strand and spiked human blood or urine with known quantities of African or Asian Zika virus strains.\n\n Viral loads in 33 samples from Zika virus-infected patients were determined by using one of the new assays.\n\n\nFindings\nOligonucleotides of the published real-time RT–PCR assays, showed up to 10 potential mismatches with the Asian lineage causing the current outbreak, compared with 0 to 4 mismatches for the new assays.\n\n The 95% lower detection limit of the seven most sensitive assays ranged from 2.1 to 12.1 uncRNA copies/reaction.\n\n Two assays had lower sensitivities of 17.0 and 1373.3 uncRNA copies/reaction and showed a similar sensitivity when using spiked samples.\n\n The mean viral loads in samples from Zika virus-infected patients were 5?×?104 RNA copies/mL of blood and 2?×?104 RNA copies/mL of urine.\n\n\nConclusion\nWe provide reagents and updated protocols for Zika virus detection suitable for the current outbreak strains.\n\n Some published assays might be unsuitable for Zika virus detection, due to the limited sensitivity and potential incompatibility with some strains.\n\n Viral concentrations in the clinical samples were close to the technical detection limit, suggesting that the use of insensitive assays will cause false-negative results.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5153932","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Victor

severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) during its emergence in humans.\n In spite of intense study, it remains unclear whether the deletion actually reflects adaptation to humans.\n Here we engineered full, partially deleted (?29?nt), and fully deleted ORF8 into a SARS-CoV infectious cDNA clone, strain Frankfurt-1. Replication of the resulting viruses was compared in primate cell cultures as well as Rhinolophus bat cells made permissive for SARS-CoV replication by lentiviral transduction of the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor.\n Cells from cotton rat, goat, and sheep provided control scenarios that represent host systems in which SARS-CoV is neither endemic nor epidemic.\n Independent of the cell system, the truncation of ORF8 (29?nt deletion) decreased replication up to 23-fold.\n The effect was independent of the type I interferon response.\n The 29?nt deletion in SARS-CoV is a deleterious mutation acquired along the initial human-to-human transmission chain.\n The resulting loss of fitness may be due to a founder effect, which has rarely been documented in processes of viral emergence.\n These results have important implications for the retrospective assessment of the threat posed by SARS.\n","id":"PMC6181990","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Doreen","surname":"Muth","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Victor

infections in adults and children.\n While their clinical representation resembles that of many other agents of the common cold, their evolutionary histories, and host associations could provide important insights into the natural history of past human pandemics.\n For two of these viruses, we have strong evidence suggesting an origin in major livestock species while primordial associations for all four viruses may have existed with bats and rodents.\n HCoV-NL63 and -229E may originate from bat reservoirs as assumed for many other coronaviruses, but HCoV-OC43 and -HKU1 seem more likely to have speciated from rodent-associated viruses.\n HCoV-OC43 is thought to have emerged from ancestors in domestic animals such as cattle or swine.\n The bovine coronavirus has been suggested to be a possible ancestor, from which HCoV-OC43 may have emerged in the context of a pandemic recorded historically at the end of the 19th century.\n New data suggest that HCoV-229E may actually be transferred from dromedary camels similar to Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus.\n This scenario provides important ecological parallels to the present prepandemic pattern of host

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and
