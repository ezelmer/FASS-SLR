The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and

patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) are unknown.\n\n\nObjectives\nThe purpose of this study was to describe the degree of myocardial injury and associated outcomes in a large hospitalized cohort with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19.\nMethods\nPatients with COVID-19 admitted to 1 of 5 Mount Sinai Health System hospitals in New York City between February 27, 2020, and April 12, 2020, with troponin-I (normal value &lt;0.03 ng/ml) measured within 24 h of admission were included (n = 2,736).\n\n Demographics, medical histories, admission laboratory results, and outcomes were captured from the hospitals’ electronic health records.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age was 66.4 years, with 59.6% men.\n\n Cardiovascular disease (CVD), including coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure, was more prevalent in patients with higher troponin concentrations, as were hypertension and diabetes.\n\n A total of 506 (18.5%) patients died during hospitalization.\n\n In all, 985 (36%) patients had elevated troponin concentrations.\n\n After adjusting for disease severity and relevant clinical factors, even small amounts of myocardial injury (e.\n\ng.\n\n, troponin I &gt;0.03 to 0.09 ng/ml; n = 455; 16.6%) were significantly associated with death (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.75; 95% CI: 1.37 to 2.24; p &lt; 0.001) while greater amounts

prevalent among patients hospitalized with COVID-19; however, troponin concentrations were generally present at low levels.\n\n Patients with CVD are more likely to have myocardial injury than patients without CVD.\n\n Troponin elevation among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is associated with higher risk

caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS?CoV?2), has rapidly evolved into a sweeping pandemic.\n\n Its major manifestation is in the respiratory tract, and the general extent of organ involvement and the microscopic changes in the lungs remain insufficiently characterised.\n\n Autopsies are essential to elucidate COVID?19?associated organ alterations.\n\n\nMethods and results\nThis article reports the autopsy findings of 21 COVID?19 patients hospitalised at the University Hospital Basel and at the Cantonal Hospital Baselland, Switzerland.\n\n An in?corpore technique was performed to ensure optimal staff safety.\n\n The primary cause of death was respiratory failure with exudative diffuse alveolar damage and massive capillary congestion, often accompanied by microthrombi despite anticoagulation.\n\n Ten cases showed superimposed bronchopneumonia.\n\n Further findings included pulmonary embolism (n = 4), alveolar haemorrhage (n = 3), and vasculitis (n = 1).\n\n Pathologies in other organ systems were predominantly attributable to shock; three patients showed signs of generalised and five of pulmonary thrombotic microangiopathy.\n\n Six patients were diagnosed with senile cardiac amyloidosis upon autopsy.\n\n Most patients suffered from one or more comorbidities (hypertension, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes mellitus).\n\n Additionally, there was an overall predominance of males and individuals with blood group A (81% and 65%, respectively).\n\n All relevant histological slides are linked as open?source scans in supplementary files.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis study provides an overview of postmortem findings in COVID?19 cases, implying that hypertensive, elderly, obese, male individuals with severe cardiovascular comorbidities as well as those with blood group A may have a lower threshold of tolerance for COVID?19. This provides a pathophysiological explanation for higher mortality rates among these patients.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7496150","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Thomas","surname":"Menter","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jasmin

SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xiaobo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiqian","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huaqing","surname":"Shu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jia'an","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yongran","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lu","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhui","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Minghao","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yaxin","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shangwen","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaojing","surname":"Zou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shiying","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"You","surname":"Shang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.cmi.2020.07.049","date":"2020-07-16","title":"Clinical

Washington","abstract":"Background\nLong-term care facilities are high-risk settings for severe outcomes from outbreaks of Covid-19, owing to both the advanced age and frequent chronic underlying health conditions of the residents and the movement of health care personnel among facilities in a region.\n\n\nMethods\nAfter identification on February 28, 2020, of a confirmed case of Covid-19 in a skilled nursing facility in King County, Washington, Public Health–Seattle and King County, aided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, launched a case investigation, contact tracing, quarantine of exposed persons, isolation of confirmed and suspected cases, and on-site enhancement of infection prevention and control.\n\n\nResults\nAs of March 18, a total of 167 confirmed cases of Covid-19 affecting 101 residents, 50 health care personnel, and 16 visitors were found to be epidemiologically linked to the facility.\n\n Most cases among residents included respiratory illness consistent with Covid-19; however, in 7 residents no symptoms were documented.\n\n Hospitalization rates for facility residents, visitors, and staff were 54.5%, 50.0%, and 6.0%, respectively.\n\n The case fatality rate for residents was 33.7% (34 of 101).\n\n As of March 18, a total of 30 long-term care facilities with at least one confirmed case of Covid-19 had been identified in King County.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn the context of rapidly escalating Covid-19 outbreaks, proactive steps by long-term care facilities to identify and exclude potentially infected staff and visitors, actively monitor for potentially infected patients, and implement appropriate infection prevention and control measures are needed to prevent the introduction of Covid-19.\n","id":"PMC7121761","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Temet M.","surname":"McMichael","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dustin

analysis","abstract":"Background\nIn the face of rapidly changing data, a range of case fatality ratio estimates for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been produced that differ substantially in magnitude.\n\n We aimed to provide robust estimates, accounting for censoring and ascertainment biases.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected individual-case data for patients who died from COVID-19 in Hubei, mainland China (reported by national and provincial health commissions to Feb 8, 2020), and for cases outside of mainland China (from government or ministry of health websites and media reports for 37 countries, as well as Hong Kong and Macau, until Feb 25, 2020).\n\n These individual-case data were used to estimate the time between onset of symptoms and outcome (death or discharge from hospital).\n\n We next obtained age-stratified estimates of the case fatality ratio by relating the aggregate distribution of cases to the observed cumulative deaths in China, assuming a constant attack rate by age and adjusting for demography and age-based and location-based under-ascertainment.\n\n We also estimated the case fatality ratio from individual line-list data on 1334 cases identified outside of mainland China.\n\n Using data on the prevalence of PCR-confirmed cases in international residents repatriated from China, we obtained age-stratified estimates of the infection fatality ratio.\n\n Furthermore, data on age-stratified severity in a subset of 3665 cases from China were used to estimate the proportion of infected individuals who are likely to require hospitalisation.\n\n\nFindings\nUsing data on 24 deaths that occurred in mainland China and 165 recoveries outside of China, we estimated the mean duration from onset of symptoms to death to be 17·8 days (95% credible interval [CrI] 16·9–19·2) and to hospital discharge to be 24·7 days (22·9–28·1).\n\n In all laboratory confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases from mainland China (n=70?117), we estimated a crude case fatality ratio (adjusted for censoring) of 3·67% (95% CrI 3·56–3·80).\n\n However, after further adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment, we obtained a best estimate of the case fatality ratio in China of 1·38% (1·23–1·53), with substantially higher ratios in older age groups (0·32% [0·27–0·38] in those aged &lt;60 years vs 6·4% [5·7–7·2] in those aged ?60 years), up to 13·4% (11·2–15·9) in those aged 80 years or older.\n\n Estimates of case fatality ratio from international cases stratified by age were consistent with those from China (parametric estimate 1·4% [0·4–3·5] in those aged &lt;60 years [n=360] and 4·5% [1·8–11·1] in those aged ?60 years [n=151]).\n\n Our estimated overall infection fatality ratio for China was 0·66% (0·39–1·33), with an increasing profile with age.\n\n Similarly, estimates of the proportion of infected individuals likely to be hospitalised increased with age up to a maximum of 18·4% (11·0–37·6) in those aged 80 years or older.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThese early estimates give an indication of the fatality ratio across the spectrum of COVID-19 disease and show a strong age gradient in risk of death.\n\n\nFunding\nUK

recovery following hip fracture.\n\n However, evidence is mixed regarding the effectiveness of interventions to improve HRQoL of elders with hip fracture.\n\n The purposes of this study were to identify distinct HRQoL trajectories and to evaluate the effects of two care models on these trajectories over 12 months following hip-fracture surgery.\n\n\nMethods\nFor this secondary analysis, data came from a randomized controlled trial of subjects with hip fracture receiving three treatment care models: interdisciplinary care (n?=?97), comprehensive care (n?=?91), and usual care (n?=?93).\n\n Interdisciplinary care consisted of geriatric consultation, discharge planning, and 4 months of in-home rehabilitation.\n\n Comprehensive care consisted of interdisciplinary care plus management of malnutrition and depressive symptoms, fall prevention, and 12 months of in-home rehabilitation.\n\n Usual care included only in-hospital rehabilitation and occasional discharge planning, without geriatric consultation and in-home rehabilitation.\n\n Mental and physical HRQoL were measured at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after discharge by the physical component summary scale (PCS) and mental component summary scale (MCS), respectively, of the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36, Taiwan version.\n\n Latent class growth modeling was used to identify PCS and MCS trajectories and to evaluate how they were affected by the interdisciplinary and comprehensive care models.\n\n\nResults\nWe identified three quadratic PCS trajectories: poor PCS (n?=?103, 36.6 %), moderate PCS (n?=?96, 34.2 %), and good PCS (n?=?82, 29.2 %).\n\n In contrast, we found three linear MCS trajectories: poor MCS (n?=?39, 13.9 %), moderate MCS (n?=?84, 29.9 %), and good MCS (n?=?158, 56.2 %).\n\n Subjects in the comprehensive care and interdisciplinary care groups were more likely to experience a good PCS trajectory (b?=?0.99, odds ratio [OR]?=?2.69, confidence interval [CI]?=?7.24–1.00, p?=?0.049, and b?=?1.32, OR?=?3.75, CI?=?10.53–1.33, p?=?0.012, respectively) than those who received usual care.\n\n However, neither care model improved MCS.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe interdisciplinary and comprehensive care models improved recovery from hip fracture by increasing subjects’ odds for following a trajectory of good physical functioning after hospitalization.\n\n\nTrial

Into Mortality Risk Assessment of a Middle-Aged and Geriatric Trauma Population?","abstract":"Introduction:\nFrailty in elderly trauma populations has been correlated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality.\n\n The Score for Trauma Triage in the Geriatric and Middle-Aged (STTGMA) is a validated mortality risk score that evaluates 4 major physiologic criteria: age, comorbidities, vital signs, and anatomic injuries.\n\n The aim of this study was to investigate whether the addition of additional frailty variables to the STTGMA tool would improve risk stratification of a middle-aged and elderly trauma population.\n\n\nMethods:\nA total of 1486 patients aged 55 years and older who met the American College of Surgeons Tier 1 to 3 criteria and/or who had orthopedic or neurosurgical traumatic consultations in the emergency department between September 2014 and September 2016 were included.\n\n The STTGMAORIGINAL and STTGMAFRAILTY scores were calculated.\n\n Additional “frailty variables” included preinjury assistive device use (disability), independent ambulatory status (functional independence), and albumin level (nutrition).\n\n The ability of the STTGMAORIGINAL and the STTGMAFRAILTY models to predict inpatient mortality was compared using area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCs).\n\n\nResults:\nThere were 23 high-energy inpatient mortalities (4.7%) and 20 low-energy inpatient mortalities (2.0%).\n\n When the STTGMAORIGINAL model was used, the AUROC in the high-energy and low-energy cohorts was 0.926 and 0.896, respectively.\n\n The AUROC for STTGMAFRAILTY for the high-energy and low-energy cohorts was 0.905 and 0.937, respectively.\n\n There was no significant difference in predictive capacity for inpatient mortality between STTGMAORIGINAL and STTGMAFRAILTY for both the high-energy and low-energy cohorts.\n\n\nConclusion:\nThe original STTGMA tool accounts for important frailty factors including cognition and general health status.\n\n These variables combined with other major physiologic variables such as age and anatomic injuries appear to be sufficient to adequately and accurately quantify inpatient mortality risk.\n\n The addition of other common frailty factors that account for does not enhance the STTGMA tool’s predictive capabilities.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5755843","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Sanjit

poliomyelitis victims with respiratory failure in an intensive care unit to treatment of severely ill patients irrespective of location or specific technology.\n Population-based studies in the developed world suggest that the burden of critical illness is higher than generally appreciated and will increase as the population ages.\n Critical care capacity has long been needed in the developing world, and efforts to improve the care of the critically ill in these settings are starting to occur.\n Expansion of critical care to handle the consequences of an ageing population, natural disasters, conflict, inadequate primary care, and higher-risk medical therapies will be challenged by high costs at a time of economic constraint.\n To meet this challenge, investigators in this discipline will need to measure the global burden of critical illness and available critical-care resources, and develop both preventive and therapeutic interventions that are generalisable

Lagos, Nigeria","abstract":"The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted global oxygen system deficiencies and revealed gaps in how we understand and measure ‘oxygen access’.\n We present a case study on oxygen access from 58 health facilities in Lagos state, Nigeria.\n We found large differences in oxygen access between facilities (primary vs secondary, government vs private) and describe three key domains to consider when measuring oxygen access: availability, cost, use.\n Of 58 facilities surveyed, 8 (14%) of facilities had a functional pulse oximeter.\n Oximeters (N=27) were typically located in outpatient clinics (12/27, 44%), paediatric ward (6/27, 22%) or operating theatre (4/27, 15%).\n 34/58 (59%) facilities had a functional source of oxygen available on the day of inspection, of which 31 (91%) facilities had it available in a single ward area, typically the operating theatre or maternity ward.\n Oxygen services were free to patients at primary health centres, when available, but expensive in hospitals and private facilities, with the median cost for 2?days oxygen 13?000 (US$36) and 27?500 (US$77) Naira, respectively.\n We obtained limited data on the cost of oxygen services to facilities.\n Pulse oximetry use was low in secondary care facilities (32%, 21/65 patients had SpO2 documented) and negligible in private facilities (2%, 3/177) and primary health centres (&lt;1%, 2/608).\n We were unable to determine the proportion of hypoxaemic patients who received oxygen therapy with available data.\n However, triangulation of existing data suggested that no facilities were equipped to meet minimum oxygen demands.\n We highlight the importance of a multifaceted approach to measuring oxygen access that assesses access at the point-of-care and ideally at the patient-level.\n We propose standard metrics to report oxygen access and describe how these can be integrated into routine health information systems and existing health facility assessment tools.\n","id":"PMC8336153","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Hamish R","surname":"Graham","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Omotayo

of the weakest parts of health systems in low-income countries.\n\n We assessed the structure and availability of resources for Emergency and Critical Care in Tanzania in order to identify the priorities for improving care in this neglected specialty.\n\n\nMethods\nTen hospitals in four regions of Tanzania were assessed using a structured data collection tool.\n\n Quality was evaluated with standards developed from the literature and expert opinion.\n\n\nResults\nImportant deficits were identified in infrastructure, routines and training.\n\n Only 30% of the hospitals had an emergency room for adult and paediatric patients.\n\n None of the seven district and regional hospitals had a triage area or intensive care unit for adults.\n\n Only 40% of the hospitals had formal systems for adult triage and in less than one third were critically ill patients seen by clinicians more than once daily.\n\n In 80% of the hospitals there were no staff trained in adult triage or critical care.\n\n In contrast, a majority of equipment and drugs necessary for emergency and critical care were available in the hospitals (median 90% and 100% respectively.\n\n The referral/private hospitals tended to have a greater overall availability of resources (median 89.7%) than district/regional hospitals (median 70.6).\n\n\nConclusions\nMany of the structures necessary for Emergency and Critical Care are lacking in hospitals in Tanzania.\n\n Particular weaknesses are infrastructure, routines and training, whereas the availability of drugs and equipment is generally good.\n\n Policies to improve hospital systems for the care of emergency and critically ill patients should be prioritised.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3639070","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Tim","surname":"Baker","email":"timothy.baker@karolinska.se","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Edwin","surname":"Lugazia","email":"elugazia@gmail.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jaran","surname":"Eriksen","email":"Jaran.Eriksen@ki.se","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Victor","surname":"Mwafongo","email":"victor.mwafongo@mnh.or.tz","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lars","surname":"Irestedt","email":"lars.irestedt@karolinska.se","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"David","surname":"Konrad","email":"david.konrad@karolinska.se","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.4314/mmj.v29i3.8","date":"2017-09-25","title":"Critical

are potentially preventable, the basic, life-saving care of critically ill patients are often overlooked in health systems.\n\n Essential Emergency and Critical Care (EECC) has been devised as the care that should be provided to all critically ill patients in all hospitals in the world.\n\n EECC includes the effective care of low cost and low complexity for the identification and treatment of critically ill patients across all medical specialties.\n\n This study aimed to specify the content of EECC and additionally, given the surge of critical illness in the ongoing pandemic, the essential diagnosis-specific care for critically ill patients with COVID-19.\nMethods\nIn a Delphi process, consensus (&gt;90% agreement) was sought from a diverse panel of global clinical experts.\n\n The panel iteratively rated proposed treatments and actions based on previous guidelines and the WHO/ICRC’s Basic Emergency Care.\n\n The output from the Delphi was adapted iteratively with specialist reviewers into a coherent and feasible package of clinical processes plus a list of hospital readiness requirements.\n\n\nResults\nThe 269 experts in the Delphi panel had clinical experience in different acute medical specialties from 59 countries and from all resource settings.\n\n The agreed EECC package contains 40 clinical processes and 67 requirements, plus additions specific for COVID-19.\nConclusion\nThe study has specified the content of care that should be provided to all critically ill patients.\n\n Implementing EECC could be an effective strategy for policy makers to reduce preventable deaths worldwide.\n\n\n","id":"PMC8458367","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Carl

in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic","abstract":"Introduction\nThe COVID-19 pandemic will test the capacity of health systems worldwide and especially so in low- and middle-income countries.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the surge capacity of the Kenyan of the Kenyan health system in terms of general hospital and ICU beds in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\nMethods\nWe assumed that 2% of the Kenyan population get symptomatic infection by SARS-Cov-2 based on modelled estimates for Kenya and determined the health system surge capacity for COVID-19 under three transmission curve scenarios, 6, 12, and 18 months.\n\n We estimated four measures of hospital surge capacity namely: 1) hospital bed surge capacity 2) ICU bed surge capacity 3) Hospital bed tipping point, and 5) ICU bed tipping point.\n\n We computed this nationally and for all the 47 county governments.\n\n\nResults\nThe capacity of Kenyan hospitals to absorb increases in caseload due to COVID-19 is constrained by the availability of oxygen, with only 58% of hospital beds in hospitals with oxygen supply.\n\n There is substantial variation in hospital bed surge capacity across counties.\n\n For example, under the 6 months transmission scenario, the percentage of available general hospital beds that would be taken up by COVID-19 cases varied from 12% Tharaka Nithi county, to 145% in Trans Nzoia county.\n\n Kenya faces substantial gaps in ICU beds and ventilator capacity.\n\n Only 22 out of the 47 counties have at least 1 ICU unit.\n\n Kenya will need an additional 1,511 ICU beds and 1,609 ventilators (6 months transmission curve) to 374 ICU beds and 472 ventilators (18 months transmission curve) to absorb caseloads due to COVID-19.\nConclusion\nSignificant gaps exist in Kenya’s capacity for hospitals to accommodate a potential surge in caseload due to COVID-19. Alongside efforts to slow and supress the transmission of the infection, the Kenyan government will need to implement adaptive measures and additional investments to expand the hospital surge capacity for COVID-19. Additional investments will however need to be strategically prioritized to focus on strengthening essential services first, such as oxygen availability before higher cost investments such as ICU beds and ventilators.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7371160","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Edwine W.","surname":"Barasa","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Paul O.","surname":"Ouma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Paul O.","surname":"Ouma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Emelda A.","surname":"Okiro","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Emelda A.","surname":"Okiro","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Olanrewaju","surname":"Oladimeji","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Olanrewaju","surname":"Oladimeji","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Olanrewaju","surname":"Oladimeji","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.36303/SAJAA.2020.26.3.2431","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Africa's critical care capacity before COVID-19","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(18)30001-1","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Perioperative patient outcomes in the African surgical outcomes study: a 7-day prospective observational cohort study","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1097/CCM.0000000000003768","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Cost-Effectiveness Studies in the ICU","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1136/bmjopen-2022-060972","date":"2022-07-18","title":"Towards definitions of critical illness and critical care using concept analysis","abstract":"Objective\nAs ‘critical illness’ and ‘critical care’ lack consensus definitions, this study aimed to explore how the concepts’ are used, describe their defining attributes, and propose potential definitions.\n\n\nDesign and methods\nWe used the Walker and Avant approach to concept analysis.\n\n The uses and definitions of the concepts were identified through a scoping review of the literature and an online survey of 114 global clinical experts.\n\n We used the Arksey and O’Malley framework for scoping reviews and searched in PubMed and Web of Science with a strategy including terms around critical illness/care and definitions/etymologies limited to publications in English between 1 January 2008 and 1 January 2020.

for forward planning","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>Predicting hospital length of stay (LoS) for patients with COVID-19 infection is essential to ensure that adequate bed capacity can be provided without unnecessarily restricting care for patients with other conditions.\n\n Here, we demonstrate the utility of three complementary methods for predicting LoS using UK national- and hospital-level data.\n\n\nMethod\nid='Par2'>On a national scale, relevant patients were identified from the COVID-19 Hospitalisation in England Surveillance System (CHESS) reports.\n\n An Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) survival model and a truncation corrected method (TC), both with underlying Weibull distributions, were fitted to the data to estimate LoS from hospital admission date to an outcome (death or discharge) and from hospital admission date to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission date.\n\n In a second approach we fit a multi-state (MS) survival model to data directly from the Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust (MFT).\n\n We develop a planning tool that uses LoS estimates from these models to predict bed occupancy.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>All methods produced similar overall estimates of LoS for overall hospital stay, given a patient is not admitted to ICU (8.4, 9.1 and 8.0 days for AFT, TC and MS, respectively).\n\n Estimates differ more significantly between the local and national level when considering ICU.\n\n National estimates for ICU LoS from AFT and TC were 12.4 and 13.4 days, whereas in local data the MS method produced estimates of 18.9 days.\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par4'>Given the complexity and partiality of different data sources and the rapidly evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is most appropriate to use multiple analysis methods on multiple datasets.\n\n The AFT method accounts for censored cases, but does not allow for simultaneous consideration of different outcomes.\n\n The TC method does not include censored cases, instead correcting for truncation in the data, but does consider these different outcomes.\n\n The MS method can model complex pathways to different outcomes whilst accounting for censoring, but cannot handle non-random case missingness.\n\n Overall, we conclude that data-driven modelling approaches of LoS using these methods is useful in epidemic planning and management, and should be considered for widespread adoption throughout healthcare systems internationally where similar data resources exist.\n\n\nSupplementary Information\nThe online version contains supplementary

data to inform evidence-based priority setting are urgently needed.\n\n Consequently, in this paper, we calculate the full economic health sector costs of COVID-19 clinical management in 79 LMICs under different epidemiological scenarios.\n\n\nMethods\nWe used country-specific epidemiological projections from a dynamic transmission model to determine number of cases, hospitalisations and deaths over 1?year under four mitigation scenarios.\n\n We defined the health sector response for three base LMICs through guidelines and expert opinion.\n\n We calculated costs through local resource use and price data and extrapolated costs across 79 LMICs.\n\n Lastly, we compared cost estimates against gross domestic product (GDP) and total annual health expenditure in 76 LMICs.\n\n\nResults\nCOVID-19 clinical management costs vary greatly by country, ranging between &lt;0.1%–12% of GDP and 0.4%–223% of total annual health expenditure (excluding out-of-pocket payments).\n\n Without mitigation policies, COVID-19 clinical management costs per capita range from US$43.39 to US$75.57; in 22 of 76 LMICs, these costs would surpass total annual health expenditure.\n\n In a scenario of stringent social distancing, costs per capita fall to US$1.10–US$1.32.\nConclusions\nWe present the first dataset of COVID-19 clinical management costs across LMICs.\n\n These costs can be used to inform decision-making on priority setting.\n\n Our results show that COVID-19 clinical management costs in LMICs are substantial, even in scenarios of moderate social distancing.\n\n Low-income countries are particularly vulnerable and some will struggle to cope with almost any epidemiological scenario.\n\n The choices facing LMICs are likely to remain stark

hip fractures and to establish the prognostic factors of mortality and walking ability after discharge.\n\n\nMETHODS:\nThis observational, retrospective study was performed in an orthogeriatric care unit on patients aged ?70 years with a diagnosis of hip fracture between 2004 and 2008. This study included 1363 patients with a mean age of 82.7±6.4 years.\n\n\nRESULTS:\nOn admission to the unit, the average Barthel score of these patients was 77.2±27.8 points, and the average Charlson index score was 2.14±2.05.

A multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to assess the effect of early surgery on the likelihood of 1-year mortality after hip fracture, adjusting for risk factors that could affect the outcome under study.\n\n The absolute number of deaths prevented by exposure to early surgery was calculated.\n\n\nResults\nWe studied a total of 405,037 admissions for hip fracture.\n\n Patients who underwent surgery within 2 days had lower 1-year mortality compared to those who waited for surgery more than 2 days (Hazard Ratios -HR-: 0.83; 95 % CI: 0.82–0.85).\n\n The number of deaths prevented by the exposure to early surgery was 5691.\nConclusions\nThis study is the first to evaluate the association between time to surgery and 1-year mortality for all Italian elderly patients hospitalized for hip fracture.\n\n The study confirmed the previous reports on the association between delayed surgery and increased mortality and complication rates in elderly patients admitted for hip

hip fracture surgery within 36 hours: an investigation of risk factors to surgical delay and recommendations for practice","abstract":"Background\nThe UK hip fracture best practice tariff (BPT) aims to deliver hip fracture surgery within 36 h of admission.\n\n Ensuring that delays are reserved for conditions which compromise survival, but are responsive to medical optimisation, would help to achieve this target.\n\n We aimed to identify medical risk factors of surgical delay, and assess their impact on mortality.\n\n\nMaterials and methods\nProspectively collected patient data was obtained from the National Hip Fracture Database (NHFD).\n\n Medical determinants of surgical delay were identified and analysed using a multivariate regression analysis.\n\n The mortality risk associated with each factor contributing to surgical delay was then calculated.\n\n\nResults\nA total 1361 patients underwent hip fracture surgery, of which 537 patients (39.5 %) received surgery within 36 h of admission.\n\n Following multivariate analyses, only hyponatraemia was deduced to be a significant risk factor for delay RR = 1.24 (95 % CI 1.06–1.44).\n\n However, following a validated propensity score matching process, a Pearson chi-square test failed to demonstrate a statistical difference in mortality incidence between the hypo- and normonatraemic patients [?2(1,

inadequately studied and epidemiological knowledge is scarce.\n\n Following the introduction of the Swedish Fracture Register (SFR), risk factors for various fractures can be studied, as well as the outcome of different treatments.\n\n The objective of this study was to analyse adult humeral fractures in Gothenburg from a descriptive epidemiological perspective.\n\n\nMethods\nAll humeral fractures registered in the SFR at Sahlgrenska University Hospital in 2011–2013 in patients aged???16 years were included.\n\n The fractures were divided into humeral segments (proximal, shaft and distal humerus) and analysed according to patient characteristics and patho-anatomical pattern.\n\n Furthermore, overall and age-specific incidence rates were calculated.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 2,011 humeral fractures were registered in the SFR, of which 79 % were proximal, 13 % shaft and 8 % distal humeral fractures.\n\n The mean age was 66.8 years and women ran a higher risk of humeral fractures than men (female/male ratio 2.4:1).\n\n On average, women were older than men at the time of fracture (mean age 70.1 years for women vs.\n\n 58.9 years for men).\n\n The overall incidence of humeral fractures was 104.7 per 100,000 inhabitants per year, with a segment-specific incidence of 83.0 for proximal fractures, 13.4 for shaft fractures and 8.3 per 100,000 person-years for distal fractures.\n\n There was a distinct increase in the age-specific incidence from the fifth decade and onwards, regardless of fracture site.\n\n Most fractures occurred in older patients (83 %?&gt;?50 years) as a result of a simple or an unspecified fall (79 %?&gt;?50 years).\n\n Only 1.2 % of all fractures were open injuries and 1.3 % were pathological.\n\n\nConclusion\nThis population-based study provides updated epidemiological data on humeral fractures in a Western-European setting.\n\n Most humeral fractures occur as the result of low-energy falls in the elderly population, indicating the influence of age-related risk factors in these fractures.\n\n The SFR will be a useful tool for providing continuous information on fracture epidemiology, risk factors and

For the majority of fractures, a modified AO/OTA classification is used.\n\n This study aimed to validate the accuracy of classification of humerus fractures in the SFR and also at providing insight into inherent classification uncertainties.\n\n\nMethods\nOne hundred and sixteen humerus fractures (among them 90 proximal) were retrieved by computer randomisation from the SFR and reassessed independently at two occasions, 6 weeks apart, by three senior orthopaedic surgeons blinded to patient information and a consensus “gold standard” classification was established.\n\n This was compared

The median incubation period was estimated to be 5.1 days (95% CI, 4.5 to 5.8 days), and 97.5% of those who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days (CI, 8.2 to 15.6 days) of infection.\n\n These estimates imply that, under conservative assumptions, 101 out of every 10 000 cases (99th percentile, 482) will develop symptoms after 14 days of active monitoring or quarantine.\n\n\nLimitation:\nPublicly reported cases may overrepresent severe cases, the incubation period for which may differ from that of mild cases.\n\n\nConclusion:\nThis work provides additional evidence for a median incubation period for COVID-19 of approximately 5 days, similar to SARS.\n\n Our results support current proposals for the length of quarantine or active monitoring of persons potentially exposed to SARS-CoV-2, although longer monitoring periods might be justified in extreme cases.\n\n\nPrimary Funding Source:\nU.\n\nS.\n\n Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institute of General Medical Sciences, and Alexander von Humboldt Foundation.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7081172","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Stephen A.","surname":"Lauer","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kyra H.","surname":"Grantz","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qifang","surname":"Bi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Forrest K.","surname":"Jones","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qulu","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hannah R.","surname":"Meredith","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Andrew S.","surname":"Azman","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nicholas G.","surname":"Reich","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Justin","surname":"Lessler","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2001316","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Early Transmission Dynamics in Wuhan, China, of Novel Coronavirus–Infected Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nThe initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

make up the host innate immune response.\n Here we show that human coronavirus (HCoV) NL63 and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) CoV papain-like proteases (PLP) antagonize innate immune signaling mediated by STING (stimulator of interferon genes, also known as MITA/ERIS/MYPS).\n STING resides in the endoplasmic reticulum and upon activation, forms dimers which assemble with MAVS, TBK-1 and IKK?, leading to IRF-3 activation and subsequent induction of interferon (IFN).\n We found that expression of the membrane anchored PLP domain from human HCoV-NL63 (PLP2-TM) or SARS-CoV (PLpro-TM) inhibits STING-mediated activation of IRF-3 nuclear translocation and induction of IRF-3 dependent promoters.\n Both catalytically active and inactive forms of CoV PLPs co-immunoprecipitated with STING, and viral replicase proteins co-localize with STING in HCoV-NL63-infected cells.\n Ectopic expression of catalytically active PLP2-TM blocks STING dimer formation and negatively regulates assembly of STING-MAVS-TBK1/IKK? complexes required for activation of IRF-3. STING dimerization was also substantially reduced in cells infected with SARS-CoV.\n Furthermore, the level of ubiquitinated forms of STING, RIG-I, TBK1 and IRF-3 are reduced in cells expressing wild type or catalytic mutants of PLP2-TM, likely contributing to disruption of signaling required for IFN induction.\n These results describe a new mechanism used by CoVs in which CoV PLPs negatively regulate antiviral defenses by disrupting the STING-mediated IFN

examined whether SARS-CoV could productively infect purified monocytes/macrophages (PM) derived from human donor cells.\n Unlike 229E-infected cells, which produced viral titers of 103.5 to 106 TCID50/ml, SARS-CoV replicated poorly in PM, producing titers of 101.75 to 102 TCID50/ml.\n This finding was similar to results reported for OC43-infected cells, with titers ranging from 101.2 to 102.7 TCID50/ml.\n Of interest, SARS-CoV proteins were detected only in PM that did not produce significant amounts of interferon (IFN)-?, and in one such case, preliminary electron microscope studies demonstrated that SARS-CoV-like particles could enter the cells, possibly via phagocytosis.\n These results suggest that SARS-CoV, like human CoV OC43, poorly infects human PM, and production of IFN-?

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) first broke out in Wuhan (China) and subsequently spread worldwide.\n\n Chloroquine has been sporadically used in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n Hydroxychloroquine shares the same mechanism of action as chloroquine, but its more tolerable safety profile makes it the preferred drug to treat malaria and autoimmune conditions.\n\n We propose that the immunomodulatory effect of hydroxychloroquine also may be useful in controlling the cytokine storm that occurs late-phase in critically ill SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.\n\n Currently, there is no evidence to support the use of hydroxychloroquine in SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n\nMethods\nThe pharmacological activity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine was tested using SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero cells.\n\n Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models (PBPK) were implemented for both drugs separately by integrating their in vitro data.\n\n Using the PBPK models, hydroxychloroquine concentrations in lung fluid were simulated under 5 different dosing regimens to explore the most effective regimen whilst considering the drug’s safety profile.\n\n\nResults\nHydroxychloroquine (EC50=0.72 ?M) was found to be more potent than chloroquine (EC50=5.47 ?M) in vitro.\n\n Based on PBPK models results, a loading dose of 400 mg twice daily of hydroxychloroquine sulfate given orally, followed by a maintenance dose of 200 mg given twice daily for 4 days is recommended for SARS-CoV-2 infection, as it reached three times the potency of chloroquine phosphate when given 500 mg twice daily 5 days in advance.\n\n\nConclusions\nHydroxychloroquine was found to be more potent than chloroquine to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in

peripheral blood samples from 27 hospitalized patients recruited during the epidemic that occurred in 2015 in South Korea.\n\n Plasma cytokines/chemokines and antibodies were quantified.\n\n Virus-specific T cells were examined by intracellular cytokine staining after stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with overlapping peptides spanning whole virus structural

high frequencies of MERS coronavirus–reactive CD8+ T cells were also observed in patients with severe/moderate illness, whereas antibody and CD4+ T-cell responses were minimally detected at this

Disease and Mortality in BALB/c Mice","abstract":"No single animal model for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) reproduces all aspects of the human disease.\n Young inbred mice support SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) replication in the respiratory tract and are available in sufficient numbers for statistical evaluation.\n They are relatively inexpensive and easily accessible, but their use in SARS research is limited because they do not develop illness following infection.\n Older (12- to 14-mo-old) BALB/c mice develop clinical illness and pneumonitis, but they can be hard to procure, and immune senescence complicates pathogenesis studies.\n We adapted the SARS-CoV (Urbani strain) by serial passage in the respiratory tract of young BALB/c mice.\n Fifteen passages resulted in a virus (MA15) that is lethal for mice following intranasal inoculation.\n Lethality is preceded by rapid and high titer viral replication in lungs, viremia, and dissemination of virus to extrapulmonary sites accompanied by lymphopenia, neutrophilia, and pathological changes in the lungs.\n Abundant viral antigen is extensively distributed in bronchial epithelial cells and alveolar pneumocytes, and necrotic cellular debris is present in airways and alveoli, with only mild and focal pneumonitis.\n These observations suggest that mice infected with MA15 die from an overwhelming viral infection with extensive, virally mediated destruction of pneumocytes and ciliated epithelial cells.\n The MA15 virus has six coding mutations associated with adaptation and increased virulence; when introduced into a recombinant SARS-CoV, these mutations result in a highly virulent and lethal virus (rMA15), duplicating the phenotype of the biologically derived MA15 virus.\n Intranasal inoculation with MA15 reproduces many aspects of disease seen in severe human cases of SARS.\n The availability of the MA15 virus will enhance the use of the mouse model for SARS because infection with MA15 causes morbidity, mortality, and pulmonary pathology.\n This virus will be of value as a stringent challenge in evaluation of the efficacy of vaccines and

SARS-CoV Bearing Epidemic and Zoonotic Spike Variants ","abstract":"Background\nIn 2003, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identified as the etiological agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome, a disease characterized by severe pneumonia that sometimes results in death.\n\n SARS-CoV is a zoonotic virus that crossed the species barrier, most likely originating from bats or from other species including civets, raccoon dogs, domestic cats, swine, and rodents.\n\n A SARS-CoV vaccine should confer long-term protection, especially in vulnerable senescent populations, against both the 2003 epidemic strains and zoonotic strains that may yet emerge from animal reservoirs.\n\n We report the comprehensive investigation of SARS vaccine efficacy in young and senescent mice following homologous and heterologous challenge.\n\n\nMethods and Findings\nUsing Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicon particles (VRP) expressing the 2003 epidemic Urbani SARS-CoV strain spike (S) glycoprotein (VRP-S) or the nucleocapsid (N) protein from the same strain (VRP-N), we demonstrate that VRP-S, but not VRP-N vaccines provide complete short- and long-term protection against homologous strain challenge in young and senescent mice.\n\n To test VRP vaccine efficacy against a heterologous SARS-CoV, we used phylogenetic analyses, synthetic biology, and reverse genetics to construct a chimeric virus (icGDO3-S) encoding a synthetic S glycoprotein gene of the most genetically divergent human strain, GDO3, which clusters among the zoonotic SARS-CoV.\n\n icGD03-S replicated efficiently in human airway epithelial cells and in the lungs of young and senescent mice, and was highly resistant to neutralization with antisera directed against the Urbani strain.\n\n Although VRP-S vaccines provided complete short-term protection against heterologous icGD03-S challenge in young mice, only limited protection was seen in vaccinated senescent animals.\n\n VRP-N vaccines not only failed to protect from homologous or heterologous challenge, but resulted in enhanced immunopathology with eosinophilic infiltrates within the lungs of SARS-CoV–challenged mice.\n\n VRP-N–induced pathology presented at day 4, peaked around day 7, and persisted through day 14, and was likely mediated by cellular immune responses.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis study identifies gaps and challenges in vaccine design for controlling future SARS-CoV zoonosis, especially in vulnerable elderly populations.\n\n The availability of a SARS-CoV virus bearing heterologous S glycoproteins provides a robust challenge inoculum for evaluating vaccine efficacy against zoonotic strains, the most likely source of future outbreaks.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1716185","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Damon","surname":"Deming","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Timothy","surname":"Sheahan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mark","surname":"Heise","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Boyd","surname":"Yount","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nancy","surname":"Davis","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Amy","surname":"Sims","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mehul","surname":"Suthar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jack","surname":"Harkema","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Alan","surname":"Whitmore","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Raymond","surname":"Pickles","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ande","surname":"West","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Eric","surname":"Donaldson","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kristopher","surname":"Curtis","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Robert","surname":"Johnston","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ralph","surname":"Baric","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Joseph","surname":"Peiris","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Joseph","surname":"Peiris","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.4049/jimmunol.181.9.6337","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Prior

Because of its relatively high transmissibility and mortality upon infection, probable SARS patients were quarantined and treated with special and intensive care.\n Therefore, instant and accurate laboratory confirmation of SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection has become a worldwide interest.\n For this need, we purified recombinant proteins including the nucleocapsid (N), envelope (E), membrane (M), and truncated forms of the spike protein (S1–S7) of SARS-CoV inEscherichia coli.\n The six proteins N, E, M, S2, S5, and S6 were used for Western blotting (WB) to detect various immunoglobulin classes in 90 serum samples from 54 probable SARS patients.\n The results indicated that N was recognized in most of the sera.\n In some cases, S6 could be recognized as early as 2 or 3 days after illness onset, while S5 was recognized at a later stage.\n Furthermore, the result of recombinant-protein-based WB showed a 90% agreement with that of the whole-virus-based immunofluorescence assay.\n Combining WB with existing RT-PCR, the laboratory confirmation for SARS-CoV infection was greatly enhanced by 24.1%, from 48.1% (RT-PCR alone) to 72.2%.\n Finally, our

However, the structural basis of RBD immunogenicity, RBD-mediated neutralization, and the role of RBD in entry steps following its binding to ACE2 have not been elucidated.\n By mimicking immune responses with the use of RBD as an antigen to screen a large human antibody library derived from healthy volunteers, we identified a novel potent cross-reactive SCV-neutralizing monoclonal antibody, m396, which competes with ACE2 for binding to RBD, and determined the crystal structure of the RBD-antibody complex at 2.3-Ä resolution.\n The antibody-bound RBD structure is completely defined, revealing two previously unresolved segments (residues 376–381 and 503–512) and a new disulfide bond (between residues 378 and 511).\n Interestingly, the overall structure of the m396-bound RBD is not significantly different from that of the ACE2-bound RBD.\n The antibody epitope is dominated by a 10-residue-long protruding ?6–?7 loop with two putative ACE2-binding hotspot residues (Ile-489 and Tyr-491).\n These results provide a structural rationale for the function of a major determinant of SCV immunogenicity and neutralization, the development of SCV therapeutics based on the antibody paratope and epitope, and a retrovaccinology approach for the design of anti-SCV vaccines.\n The available structural information indicates that the SCV entry may not be mediated by ACE2-induced conformational changes in the RBD but may involve other conformational changes or/and yet to be identified coreceptors.\n","id":"PMC8099238","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ponraj","surname":"Prabakaran","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jianhua","surname":"Gan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Feng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhongyu","surname":"Zhu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Vidita","surname":"Choudhry","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaodong","surname":"Xiao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xinhua","surname":"Ji","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dimiter S.","surname":"Dimitrov","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The use of anti-inflammatory drugs in the treatment of people with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): the Perspectives of clinical immunologists from China","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Pathogenic human coronavirus infections: causes and consequences of cytokine storm and immunopathology","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Cytokine storm and sepsis disease pathogenesis","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.23812/CONTI-E","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 and IL-6) and lung inflammation by Coronavirus-19 (COVI-19 or SARS-CoV-2): anti-inflammatory strategies","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/s0140-6736(20)30566-3","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study","abstract":"Background\nSince December, 2019, Wuhan, China, has experienced an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).\n\n Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (?18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.\n\n\nFindings\n191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital.\n\n 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients).\n\n Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·03–1·17, per year increase; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·61–12·23; p&lt;0·0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL (18·42, 2·64–128·55; p=0·0033) on admission.\n\n Median duration of viral shedding was 20·0 days (IQR 17·0–24·0) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors.\n\n The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage.\n\n Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.\n\n\nFunding\nChinese Academy of Medical Sciences Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences; National Science Grant for Distinguished Young Scholars; National Key

Severe cases tend to have lower lymphocytes counts, higher leukocytes counts and neutrophil-lymphocyte-ratio (NLR), as well as lower percentages of monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils.\n\n Most of severe cases demonstrated elevated levels of infection-related biomarkers and inflammatory cytokines.\n\n The number of T cells significantly decreased, and more hampered in severe cases.\n\n Both

Proximal Femoral Fragility Fractures in Patients with COVID-19 During the SARS-CoV-2 Outbreak in Northern Italy","abstract":"Background:\nFrom February 20 to April 2020, the coronavirus SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome)-CoV-2 spread in northern Italy, drastically challenging the care capacities of the national health care system.\n\n Unprepared for this emergency, hospitals have quickly reformulated paths of assistance in an effort to guarantee treatment for infected patients.\n\n Orthopaedic departments have been focused on elderly traumatology, especially the treatment of femoral neck fractures in patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19).\n\n The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the orthopaedic management strategy for femoral fragility fractures in COVID-19-positive patients with the hypothesis that operative treatment may contribute to the overall stability of the patient.\n\n\nMethods:\nSixteen patients affected by proximal femoral fracture and a recent history of fever, shortness of breath, and desaturation were admitted to the emergency room.\n\n Thoracic computed tomography (CT) and oropharyngeal swabs confirmed that they were positive for COVID-19, requiring hospitalization and prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin.\n\n\nResults:\nThree patients died before surgery because of severe respiratory insufficiency and multiple-organ-failure syndrome.\n\n Ten patients underwent surgery on the day after admission, whereas 3 patients had suspended their use of direct thrombin inhibitors and needed surgery to be delayed until the third day after admission.\n\n In all patients except 1, we noted an improvement in terms of O2 saturation and assisted respiration.\n\n In 9 patients, hemodynamic and respiratory stability was observed at an average of 7 days postoperatively.\n\n Four patients who underwent surgical treatment died of respiratory failure on the first day after surgery (1 patient), the third day after surgery (2 patients), or the seventh day after surgery (1 patient).\n\n\nConclusions:\nWe noted a stabilization of respiratory parameters in 12 COVID-19-positive patients who underwent surgery treatment of proximal femoral fractures.\n\n We believe that in elderly patients with COVID-19 who have proximal femoral fractures, surgery may contribute to the overall stability of the patient, seated mobilization, improvement in physiological ventilation, and general patient comfort in bed.\n\n\nLevel of Evidence:\nPrognostic Level IV.\n\n See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of

Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and

characterisation and epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and

perioperatively.\n We searched multiple electronic databases for relevant research papers, and carried out meta-analyses of weighted mean differences and interpreted in the light of statistical heterogeneity (I2).\n Fifteen RCTs recruiting 641 patients were included.\n Dexmedetomidine treatment significantly decreased interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-?) levels with mean differences [95% CI] in the changes from baseline between dexmedetomidine treated and controls of ?25.14 [?35.29, ?15.00]; P?&lt;?0.00001 (for IL-6), ?5.69 [?10.77, ?0.60]; P?&lt;?0.04 (for IL-8), and ?20.30 [?30.93, ?9.67]; P?&lt;?0.0002 (for TNF-?) immediately after surgery; and ?41.55 [?57.41, ?25.70]; P?&lt;?0.00001 (IL-6), ?6.46 [?10.83, ?2.08]; P?&lt;?0.005 (IL-8), and ?14.67

The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and

period of COVID-19 at Renmin Hospital, Zhongnan Hospital, Tongji Hospital and Central Hospital in Wuhan, from January 1 to February 5, 2020.\nFindings\nOf the 34 operative patients, the median age was 55 years (IQR, 43–63), and 20 (58·8%) patients were women.\n\n All patients developed COVID-19 pneumonia shortly after surgery with abnormal findings on chest computed tomographic scans.\n\n Common symptoms included fever (31 [91·2%]), fatigue (25 [73·5%]) and dry cough (18 [52·9%]).\n\n 15 (44·1%) patients required admission to intensive care unit (ICU) during disease progression, and 7 patients (20·5%) died after admission to ICU.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients were older, were more likely to have underlying comorbidities, underwent more difficult surgeries, as well as more severe laboratory abnormalities (eg, hyperleukocytemia, lymphopenia).\n\n The most common complications in non-survivors included ARDS, shock, arrhythmia and acute cardiac injury.\n\n\nInterpretation\nIn this retrospective cohort study of 34 operative patients with confirmed COVID-19, 15 (44·1%) patients needed ICU care, and the mortality rate was
