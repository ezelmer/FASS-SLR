aimed to identify clinical characteristics and epidemiological factors associated with influenza among community-dwelling adults aged ?60 years presenting to emergency departments.\n\n\nMethods\nWe identified patients with influenza-compatible chief complaints presenting to emergency departments of six acute care hospitals in Ontario, Canada during the 2011/12 and 2012/13 influenza seasons.\n\n Clinical characteristics, medical history and demographics were collected by patient interview, chart review and by contacting vaccine providers.\n\n Nasopharyngeal swabs were tested for influenza using polymerase chain reaction.\n\n We modeled predictors of influenza using multivariable logistic regression models that compared individuals with and without influenza.\n\n\nResults\nOf 1318 participants, 151 (11 %) had influenza (98 A/H3N2, 12 A/H1N1, 4 A [not sub-typed], 37 B).\n\n In the multivariable model, clinical symptoms associated with influenza were cough (OR 6.4, 95 % CI 3.2, 13.0), feverishness and/or triage temperature ?37.2 °C (OR 3.0, 95 % CI 2.0, 4.7), 2–5 days from symptom onset to the emergency department visit (OR 2.2, 95 % CI 1.5, 3.2), and wheezing (OR 2.1, 95 %

health conditions of the residents and the movement of health care personnel among facilities in a region.\n\n\nMethods\nAfter identification on February 28, 2020, of a confirmed case of Covid-19 in a skilled nursing facility in King County, Washington, Public Health–Seattle and King County, aided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, launched a case investigation, contact tracing, quarantine of exposed persons, isolation of confirmed and suspected cases, and on-site enhancement of infection prevention and control.\n\n\nResults\nAs of March 18, a total of 167 confirmed cases of Covid-19 affecting 101 residents, 50 health care personnel, and 16 visitors were found to be epidemiologically linked to the facility.\n\n Most cases among residents included respiratory illness consistent with Covid-19; however, in 7 residents no symptoms were documented.\n\n Hospitalization rates for facility residents, visitors, and staff were 54.5%, 50.0%, and 6.0%, respectively.\n\n The

among acutely admitted older medical patients: a cohort study","abstract":"Background\nOlder people have the highest incidence of acute medical admissions.\n\n Old age and acute hospital admissions are associated with a high risk of adverse health outcomes after discharge, such as reduced physical performance, readmissions and mortality.\n\n Hospitalisations in this population are often by acute admission and through the emergency department.\n\n This, along with the rapidly increasing proportion of older people, warrants the need for clinically feasible tools that can systematically assess vulnerability in older medical patients upon acute hospital admission.\n\n These are essential for prioritising treatment during hospitalisation and after discharge.\n\n\nMethods\nA cohort study of acutely admitted medical patients aged 65 or older.\n\n Survival time within a 3 years post-discharge follow up period was used as the outcome.\n\n The associations between the markers and survival time were investigated by Cox regression analyses.\n\n For analyses, all markers were grouped by quartiles.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 4,005 patients were included.\n\n Among the 3,172 patients without a cancer diagnosis, mortality within 3 years was 39.9%.\n\n Univariate and multiple regression analyses for each marker showed that all were significantly associated with post-discharge survival.\n\n The changes between the estimates for the FI-OutRef quartiles in the univariate- and the multiple analyses were negligible.\n\n Among all the markers investigated, FI-OutRef had the highest hazard ratio of the fourth quartile versus the first quartile: 3.45 (95% CI: 2.83-s4.22, P &lt; 0.001).\n\n\nConclusion\nAmong acutely admitted older medical patients, FI-OutRef was strongly associated with long-term mortality.\n\n This association was independent of age, sex, and number of chronic diagnoses, new chronic diagnoses, and new acute admissions.\n\n Hence FI-OutRef could be a biomarker of advancement of aging within the acute care setting.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12877-017-0434-3) contains supplementary material, which is

China.\n\n\nParticipants\nConsecutive CAP patients aged ?65 years admitted to the geriatric department of our hospital between September 2017 and February 2019.\nMain outcome measures\nThe primary outcomes were all-cause mortality at 30 days and 1?year after hospital admission.\n\n The impact of frailty (defined by frailty phenotype) on 30-day and 1-year mortality of elderly patients with CAP was assessed by Cox regression analysis.\n\n\nResults\nThe cohort included 256 patients.\n\n The median (IQR) age was 86 (81–90) years, and 180 (70.3%) participants were men.\n\n A total of 171/256 (66.8%) patients were frail.\n\n The prevalence of frailty was significantly associated with older age, female gender, lower body mass index, comorbidities, limitations in activities of daily living

frailty, and promote person-centred care.\n\n\nRecommendations for Screening and Assessment\nThe task force recommends that health practitioners case identify/screen all older adults for frailty using a validated instrument suitable for the specific setting or context (strong recommendation).\n\n Ideally, the screening instrument should exclude disability as part of the screening process.\n\n For individuals screened as positive for frailty, a more comprehensive clinical assessment should be performed to identify signs and underlying mechanisms of frailty (strong recommendation).\n\n\nRecommendations for Management\nA comprehensive care plan for frailty should address polypharmacy (whether rational or nonrational), the management of sarcopenia, the treatable causes of weight loss, and the causes of exhaustion (depression, anaemia, hypotension, hypothyroidism, and B12 deficiency) (strong recommendation).\n\n All persons with frailty should receive social support as needed to address unmet needs and encourage adherence to a comprehensive care plan (strong recommendation).\n\n First-line therapy for the management of frailty should include a multi-component physical activity programme with a resistance-based training component (strong recommendation).\n\n Protein/caloric supplementation is recommended when weight loss or undernutrition are present (conditional recommendation).\n\n No recommendation was given for systematic additional therapies such as cognitive therapy, problem-solving therapy, vitamin D supplementation, and

Observational evidence linking nutrition with frailty appears most robust for dietary quality: for example, dietary patterns such as the Mediterranean diet appear to be protective.\n In addition, research on specific foods, such as a higher consumption of fruit and vegetables and lower consumption of ultra-processed foods are consistent, with healthier profiles linked to lower frailty risk.\n Few dietary intervention studies have been conducted to date, although a growing number of trials that combine supplementation with exercise training suggest a multi-domain approach may be more effective.\n This review is based on an interdisciplinary workshop, held in November 2020, and synthesises current understanding of dietary influences on frailty, focusing on opportunities for prevention and treatment.\n Longer term prospective studies and well-designed trials are needed to determine the causal effects of nutrition on frailty risk and progression and how dietary change can

provides an excellent description of how such changes occur.\n\n Given that cognition also changes with age, we wondered whether the same model might also describe the accumulation of errors in cognitive test scores in community-dwelling older adults.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this prospective cohort study, 8954 older people (aged 65+ at baseline) from the Canadian Study of Health and Aging were followed for 10 years.\n\n Cognitive status was defined by the number of errors on the 100-point Modified Min-Mental State Examination.\n\n The error count was chosen to parallel the deficit count in the general model of aging, which is based on deficit accumulation.\n\n As with the deficit count, a Markov chain transition model was employed, with 4 parameters.\n\n\nResults\nOn average, the chance of making errors increased linearly with the number of errors present at each time interval.\n\n Changes in cognitive states were described with high accuracy (R2 = 0.96) by a modified Poisson distribution, using four parameters: the background chance of accumulating additional errors, the chance of incurring more or fewer errors, given the existing number, and the corresponding background and incremental chances of dying.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe change in the number of errors in a cognitive test corresponded to a general model that also summarizes age-related changes in deficits.\n\n The model accounts for both improvement and deterioration and appears to represent a clinically relevant means of quantifying how various aspects of health status change with age.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2292725","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Arnold","surname":"Mitnitski","email":"Arnold.Mitnitski@Dal.ca","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kenneth","surname":"Rockwood","email":"Kenneth.Rockwood@Dal.ca","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1111/j.1532-5415.2006.00738.x","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Long-term

belongs to the species of SARSr-CoV.\n In addition, 2019-nCoV virus isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of a critically ill patient could be neutralized by sera from several patients.\n Notably, we confirmed that 2019-nCoV uses the same cell entry receptor—angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2)—as

effect of angiotensin?converting enzyme 2 and its effect on the prognosis of COVID?19","abstract":"This article reviews the correlation between angiotensin?converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and severe risk factors for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID?19) and the possible mechanisms.\n ACE2 is a crucial component of the renin?angiotensin system (RAS).\n The classical RAS ACE?Ang II?AT1R regulatory axis and the ACE2?Ang 1?7?MasR counter?regulatory axis play an essential role in maintaining homeostasis in humans.\n ACE2 is widely distributed in the heart, kidneys, lungs, and testes.\n ACE2 antagonizes the activation of the classical RAS system and protects against organ damage, protecting against hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.\n Similar to SARS?CoV, SARS?CoV?2 also uses the ACE2 receptor to invade human alveolar epithelial cells.\n Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a clinical high?mortality disease, and ACE2 has a protective effect on this type of acute lung injury.\n Current research shows that the poor prognosis of patients with COVID?19 is related to factors such as sex (male), age (&gt;60 years), underlying diseases (hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease), secondary ARDS, and other relevant factors.\n Because of these protective effects of ACE2 on chronic underlying diseases and ARDS, the development of spike protein?based vaccine and drugs enhancing ACE2 activity may become one of the most promising approaches for the treatment of COVID?19 in the future.\n","id":"PMC7317908","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Hao","surname":"Cheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yan","surname":"Wang","email":"wangyanwang@bjmu.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yan","surname":"Wang","email":"wangyanwang@bjmu.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gui?Qiang","surname":"Wang","email":"john131212@126.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gui?Qiang","surname":"Wang","email":"john131212@126.com","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1093/eurheart/ehaa373","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Circulating

tissues from patients with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer (PC) using new approach- ACE phenotyping, that includes evaluation of: 1) ACE activity with two substrates (HHL and ZPHL); 2) the ratio of the rates of their hydrolysis (ZPHL/HHL ratio); 3) the ratio of immunoreactive ACE protein to ACE activity; 4) the pattern of mAbs binding to different epitopes on ACE – ACE

activity increased in PC tissues.\n The catalytic parameter, ZPHL/HHL ratio, increased in prostate tissues from all patients with PC, but was did not change for most |BPH patients.\n Nevertheless, prostate tissues of several patients diagnosed with BPH based on histology, also demonstrated decreased ACE activity and increased immunoreactive ACE protein/ACE activity and ZPHL/HHL ratios, that could be considered as more early indicators of prostate cancer development than routine histology.\n Thus, ACE phenotyping of prostate biopsies has a potential to be an effective approach for early

rampant paranoia), there is a concern that biomedical research as a profession is waning in the United States (see ”Rescuing US biomedical research from its systemic flaws” by Alberts and colleagues in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences).\n However, it is wonderful to discover something new and to tackle tough puzzles.\n If we could focus more of our effort on discussing scientific problems and doing research, then we could be more productive and perhaps happier.\n One potential solution is to focus efforts on small thematic institutes in the university structure that can provide a stimulating and supportive environment for innovation and exploration.\n With an open-lab concept, there are economies of scale that can diminish paperwork and costs, while providing greater access to state-of-the-art equipment.\n Merging multiple disciplines around a common theme can catalyze innovation, and this enables individuals to develop new concepts without giving up the credit they deserve, because it is usually clear who did the work.\n Small institutes do not solve larger systemic problems but rather enable collective efforts to address the noisome aspects of the system and foster an innovative community effort to address scientific problems.\n","id":"PMC4214771","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Michael

researchers because of its characteristic auditory sensitivities and emotional responsiveness to music.\n However, actual musical perception and production abilities are more variable.\n We examined musicality in WS through the lens of amusia and explored how their musical perception abilities related to their auditory sensitivities, musical production skills, and emotional responsiveness to music.\n In our sample of 73 adolescents and adults with WS, 11% met criteria for amusia, which is higher than the 4% prevalence rate reported in the typically developing (TD) population.\n Amusia was not related to auditory sensitivities but was related to musical training.\n Performance on the amusia measure strongly predicted musical skill but not emotional responsiveness to music, which was better predicted by general auditory sensitivities.\n This study represents the first time amusia has been examined in a population with a known neurodevelopmental genetic disorder with a range of cognitive abilities.\n Results have implications for the relationships across different levels of auditory processing, musical skill development, and emotional responsiveness to music, as well as the understanding of gene-brain-behavior relationships in individuals with WS and TD individuals with and without

solutions for implementing and managing medical registries as well as aggregate, reproduce, and access data sets from legacy formats and platforms to advanced standard formats and operating systems are crucial for both clinical healthcare and biomedical research settings.\n\n\nPurpose\nOur study describes a reproducible, highly scalable, standard framework for a device registry implementation addressing both local data quality components and global linking problems.\n\n\nMethods and Results\nWe developed a device registry framework involving the following steps: (1) Data standards definition and representation of the research workflow, (2) Development of electronic case report forms using REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture), (3) Data collection according to the clinical research workflow and, (4) Data augmentation by enriching the registry database with local electronic health records, governmental database and linked open data collections, (5) Data quality control and (6) Data dissemination through the registry Web site.\n\n Our registry adopted all applicable standardized data elements proposed by American College Cardiology / American Heart Association Clinical Data Standards, as well as variables derived from cardiac devices randomized trials and Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium.\n\n Local interoperability was performed between REDCap and data derived from Electronic Health Record system.\n\n The original data set was also augmented by incorporating the reimbursed values paid by the Brazilian government during a hospitalization for pacemaker implantation.\n\n By linking our registry to the open data collection repository Linked Clinical Trials (LinkedCT) we found 130 clinical trials which are potentially correlated with our pacemaker registry.\n\n\nConclusion\nThis study demonstrates how standard and reproducible solutions can be applied in the implementation of medical registries to constitute a re-usable framework.\n\n Such approach has the potential to facilitate data integration between healthcare and research settings, also being a useful framework to be used in other biomedical registries.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3723676","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Kátia Regina","surname":"da

development","abstract":"Rare disease registries (RDRs) are an essential tool to improve knowledge and monitor interventions for rare diseases.\n If designed appropriately, patient and disease related information captured within them can become the cornerstone for effective diagnosis and new therapies.\n Surprisingly however, registries possess a diverse range of functionality, operate in different, often-times incompatible, software environments and serve various, and sometimes incongruous, purposes.\n Given the ambitious goals of the International Rare Diseases Research Consortium (IRDiRC) by 2020 and beyond, RDRs must be designed with the agility to evolve and efficiently interoperate in an ever changing rare disease landscape, as well as to cater for rapid changes in Information Communication Technologies.\n In this paper, we contend that RDR requirements will also evolve in response to a number of factors such as changing disease definitions and diagnostic criteria, the requirement to integrate patient/disease information from advances in either biotechnology and/or phenotypying approaches, as well as the need to adapt dynamically to security and privacy concerns.\n We dispel a number of myths in RDR development, outline key criteria for robust and sustainable RDR implementation and introduce the concept of a RDR Checklist to guide future RDR development.\n","id":"PMC4015362","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Matthew","surname":"Bellgard","email":"mbellgard@ccg.murdoch.edu.au","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Christophe","surname":"Beroud","email":"christophe.beroud@inserm.fr","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kay","surname":"Parkinson","email":"kay.parkinson@alstrom.org.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tess","surname":"Harris","email":"tess.harris@pkdcharity.org.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Segolene","surname":"Ayme","email":"segolene.ayme@inserm.fr","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gareth","surname":"Baynam","email":"Gareth.Baynam@health.wa.gov.au","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tarun","surname":"Weeramanthri","email":"Tarun.Weeramanthri@health.wa.gov.au","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hugh","surname":"Dawkins","email":"Hugh.Dawkins@health.wa.gov.au","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Adam","surname":"Hunter","email":"ahunter@ccg.murdoch.edu.au","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1542/peds.2011-0774","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Pediatric

adapted for postoperative care.\n\n Our research team developed a cognitive-behavioral based self-management approach to postoperative rehabilitation (Changing Behavior through Physical Therapy (CBPT)).\n\n Pilot testing of the CBPT program demonstrated greater improvement in pain, disability, physical and mental health, and physical performance compared to education.\n\n The current study compares which of two treatments provided by telephone – a CBPT Program or an Education Program about postoperative recovery - are more effective for improving patient-centered outcomes in adults following lumbar spine surgery for degenerative conditions.\n\n\nMethods/design\nA multi-center, comparative effectiveness trial will be conducted.\n\n Two hundred and sixty patients undergoing lumbar spine surgery for degenerative conditions will be recruited from two medical centers and community surgical practices.\n\n Participants will be randomly assigned to CBPT or Education at 6 weeks following surgery.\n\n Treatments consist of six weekly telephone sessions with a trained physical therapist.\n\n The primary outcome will be disability and secondary outcomes include pain, general health, and physical activity.\n\n Outcomes will be assessed preoperatively and at 6 weeks, 6 months and 12 months after surgery by an assessor masked to group allocation.\n\n\nDiscussion\nEffective rehabilitation treatments that can guide clinicians in their recommendations, and patients in their actions will have the potential to effect change in current clinical practice.\n\n\nTrial registration\nNCT02184143.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/1471-2474-15-325) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized

implementation and sharing of PhenX measures","abstract":"Background\nThe purpose of this manuscript is to describe the PhenX RISING network and the site experiences in the implementation of PhenX measures into ongoing population-based genomic studies.\n\n\nMethods\nEighty PhenX measures were implemented across the seven PhenX RISING groups, thirty-three of which were used at more than two sites, allowing for cross-site collaboration.\n\n Each site used between four and 37 individual measures and five of the sites are validating the PhenX measures through comparison with other study measures.\n\n Self-administered and computer-based administration modes are being evaluated at several sites which required changes to the original PhenX Toolkit protocols.\n\n A network-wide data use agreement was developed to facilitate data sharing and collaboration.\n\n\nResults\nPhenX Toolkit measures have been collected for more than 17,000 participants across the PhenX RISING network.\n\n The process of implementation provided information that was used to improve the PhenX Toolkit.\n\n The Toolkit was revised to allow researchers to select self- or interviewer administration when creating the data collection worksheets and ranges of specimens necessary to run biological assays has been added to the Toolkit.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe PhenX RISING network has demonstrated that the PhenX Toolkit measures can be implemented successfully in ongoing genomic studies.\n\n The next step will be to conduct gene/environment studies.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3994539","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Catherine

disease registry","abstract":"Objective\nRegistries are a well-established mechanism for obtaining high quality, disease-specific data, but are often highly project-specific in their design, implementation, and policies for data use.\n\n In contrast to the conventional model of centralized data contribution, warehousing, and control, we design a self-scaling registry technology for collaborative data sharing, based upon the widely adopted Integrating Biology &amp; the Bedside (i2b2) data warehousing framework and the Shared Health Research Information Network (SHRINE) peer-to-peer networking software.\n\n\nMaterials and methods\nFocusing our design around creation of a scalable solution for collaboration within multi-site disease registries, we leverage the i2b2 and SHRINE open source software to create a modular, ontology-based, federated infrastructure that provides research investigators full ownership and access to their contributed data while supporting permissioned yet robust data sharing.\n\n We accomplish these objectives via web services supporting peer-group overlays, group-aware data aggregation, and administrative functions.\n\n\nResults\nThe 56-site Childhood Arthritis &amp; Rheumatology Research Alliance (CARRA) Registry and 3-site Harvard Inflammatory Bowel Diseases Longitudinal Data Repository now utilize i2b2 self-scaling registry technology (i2b2-SSR).\n\n This platform, extensible to federation of multiple projects within and between research networks, encompasses &gt;6000 subjects at sites throughout the USA.\n\n\nDiscussion\nWe utilize the i2b2-SSR platform to minimize technical barriers to collaboration while enabling fine-grained control over data sharing.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe implementation of i2b2-SSR for the multi-site, multi-stakeholder CARRA Registry has established a digital infrastructure for community-driven research data sharing in pediatric rheumatology in the USA.\n\n We envision i2b2-SSR as a scalable, reusable solution facilitating interdisciplinary research across diseases.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3555330","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Marc

society.\n In spite of the growing attention for the concept among European health policymakers, researchers and practitioners, information about the status of health literacy in Europe remains scarce.\n This article presents selected findings from the first European comparative survey on health literacy in populations.\n Methods: The European health literacy survey (HLS-EU) was conducted in eight countries: Austria, Bulgaria, Germany, Greece, Ireland, the Netherlands, Poland and Spain (n = 1000 per country, n = 8000 total sample).\n Data collection was based on Eurobarometer standards and the implementation of the HLS-EU-Q (questionnaire) in computer-assisted or paper-assisted personal interviews.\n Results: The HLS-EU-Q constructed four levels of health literacy: insufficient, problematic, sufficient and excellent.\n At least 1 in 10 (12%) respondents showed insufficient health literacy and almost 1 in 2 (47%) had limited (insufficient or problematic) health literacy.\n However, the distribution of levels differed substantially across countries (29–62%).\n Subgroups within the population, defined by financial deprivation, low social status, low education or old age, had higher proportions of people with limited health literacy, suggesting the presence of a social gradient which was also confirmed by raw bivariate correlations and a multivariate linear regression model.\n Discussion: Limited health literacy represents an important challenge for health policies and practices across Europe, but to a different degree for different countries.\n The social gradient in health literacy must be taken into account when developing public health strategies to improve health equity in Europe.\n","id":"PMC4668324","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Kristine","surname":"Sørensen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jürgen

interventions.\n As expected, mandatory vaccinations seem to be the most useful intervention to increase the vaccination uptake in HCWs.\n However, our study suggests that better results in the vaccination uptake in HCWs were obtained by combining interventions in different areas.\n Educational campaigns alone could not have an impact on vaccination coverage.\n LTCFs represent an ideal

the World Health Organization in 2019 and is associated with negative health outcomes.\n Previous reviews on cause of vaccines have not included vaccine hesitancy related to the COVID-19 vaccine.\n This review aimed to fill this gap by synthesising the findings of studies identifying causes of vaccine hesitancy to the COVID-19 and influenza vaccines.\n Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted.\n Searches were carried out in the PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane databases.\n Following data extraction, a thematic analysis was conducted of the causes of vaccine hesitancy in adults for the influenza and COVID-19 vaccines.\n Results: Fourteen papers were included.\n Four themes were identified as causes of vaccine hesitancy comprising: concerns over safety, lack of trust, lack of need for vaccination and cultural reasons.\n While concerns over safety were found in all countries, some of these were specific to particular countries and cultures.\n Our findings suggest that scientific knowledge of vaccines and size of clinical trials during their development reduce vaccine hesitancy.\n However, pharmaceutical companies were not a trusted source of information.\n Conclusion: Our

aimed to identify clinical characteristics and epidemiological factors associated with influenza among community-dwelling adults aged ?60 years presenting to emergency departments.\n\n\nMethods\nWe identified patients with influenza-compatible chief complaints presenting to emergency departments of six acute care hospitals in Ontario, Canada during the 2011/12 and 2012/13 influenza seasons.\n\n Clinical characteristics, medical history and demographics were collected by patient interview, chart review and by contacting vaccine providers.\n\n Nasopharyngeal swabs were tested for influenza using polymerase chain reaction.\n\n We modeled predictors of influenza using multivariable logistic regression models that compared individuals with and without influenza.\n\n\nResults\nOf 1318 participants, 151 (11 %) had influenza (98 A/H3N2, 12 A/H1N1, 4 A [not sub-typed], 37 B).\n\n In the multivariable model, clinical symptoms associated with influenza were cough (OR 6.4, 95 % CI 3.2, 13.0), feverishness and/or triage temperature ?37.2 °C (OR 3.0, 95 % CI 2.0, 4.7), 2–5 days from symptom onset to the emergency department visit (OR 2.2, 95 % CI 1.5, 3.2), and wheezing (OR 2.1, 95 % CI 1.3, 3.3).\n\n The effect of cough on influenza increased with older age.\n\n Epidemiological factors associated with increased odds for influenza included weeks when ?10 % influenza tests from provincial laboratories were positive (OR 5.1, 95 % CI 1.2, 21.7) and exposure to a person with influenza-like illness (OR 1.9, 95 % CI 1.3, 2.8).\n\n Among participants with influenza, only 47 (31 %) met the U.\n\nS.\n\n Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for influenza-like illness (temperature ?37.8 °C and cough and/or sore throat).\n\n\nConclusions\nAs in younger adults, cough and feverishness are the two symptoms most predictive of influenza in the elderly.\n\n Current influenza-like illness definitions did not adequately capture influenza in older adults.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5084347","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Po-Po","surname":"Lam","email":"popo.lam@utoronto.ca","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Brenda

Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China","abstract":"Background\nSince December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7092819","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Wei-jie","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng-yi","surname":"Ni","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng-yi","surname":"Ni","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yu","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wen-hua","surname":"Liang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chun-quan","surname":"Ou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jian-xing","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Shan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chun-liang","surname":"Lei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"David

Furthermore, a COVID-19–specific assessment tool was developed locally, focusing on key symptoms observed in this population which assess dyspnoea, distress, and discomfort.\n\n This tool helped to guide the palliative care management as per patients' disease stage.\n\n\nResults\nA management plan for all patients' (stable, unstable, end of life) was created and implemented in acute hospitals.\n\n Medication guidelines were based on the limitations in resources and availability of drugs.\n\n Staff members who were unfamiliar with palliative care required simple, clear instructions to follow including medications for key symptoms such as dyspnoea, distress, fever, and discomfort.\n\n Nursing interventions and family involvement were adapted as per patients' disease stage and infection control requirements.\n\n\nConclusion\nPalliative care during the COVID-19 pandemic needs to adapt to an emergency style of palliative care as patients can deteriorate rapidly and require quick decisions and clear treatment plans.\n\n These need to be easily followed up by generalist staff members caring for these patients.\n\n Furthermore, palliative care should be at the forefront to help make the best decisions, give care to families, and offer spiritual support.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7144848","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Tanja","surname":"Fusi-Schmidhauser","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nancy J.","surname":"Preston","email":"n.j.preston@lancaster.ac.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nikola","surname":"Keller","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Claudia","surname":"Gamondi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"WHO.

quarantine plus school closure; quarantine plus workplace distancing; and quarantine, school closure, and workplace distancing (hereafter referred to as the combined intervention).\n\n We also did sensitivity analyses by altering the asymptomatic fraction of infections (22·7%, 30·0%, 40·0%, and 50·0%) to compare outbreak sizes under the same control measures.\n\n\nFindings\nFor the baseline scenario, when R0 was 1·5, the median cumulative number of infections at day 80 was 279?000 (IQR 245?000–320?000), corresponding to 7·4% (IQR 6·5–8·5) of the resident population of Singapore.\n\n The median number of infections increased with higher infectivity: 727?000 cases (670?000–776?000) when R0 was 2·0, corresponding to 19·3% (17·8–20·6) of the Singaporean population, and 1?207?000 cases (1?164?000–1?249?000) when R0 was 2·5, corresponding to 32% (30·9–33·1) of the Singaporean population.\n\n Compared with the baseline scenario, the combined intervention was the most effective, reducing the estimated median number of infections by 99·3% (IQR 92·6–99·9) when R0 was 1·5, by 93·0% (81·5–99·7) when R0 was 2·0, and by 78·2% (59·0 ?94·4) when R0 was 2·5. Assuming increasing asymptomatic fractions up to 50·0%, up to 277 000 infections were estimated to occur at day 80 with the combined intervention relative to 1800 for the baseline at R0 of 1·5.\nInterpretation\nImplementing the combined intervention of quarantining infected individuals and their family members, workplace distancing, and school closure once community transmission has been detected could substantially reduce the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections.\n\n We therefore recommend immediate deployment of this strategy if local secondary transmission is confirmed within Singapore.\n\n However, quarantine and workplace distancing should be prioritised over school closure because at this early stage, symptomatic children have higher withdrawal rates from school than do symptomatic adults from work.\n\n At higher asymptomatic proportions, intervention effectiveness might be substantially reduced requiring the need for effective case management and treatments, and preventive measures such as vaccines.\n\n\nFunding\nSingapore Ministry of Health, Singapore Population Health Improvement Centre.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7158571","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Joel R","surname":"Koo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alex R","surname":"Cook","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Minah","surname":"Park","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yinxiaohe","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Haoyang","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jue Tao","surname":"Lim","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Clarence","surname":"Tam","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Borame L","surname":"Dickens","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A systematic review on the causes of the transmission and control measures of outbreaks in long-term care facilities: back to basics of infection control","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Infection prevention and control in nursing homes: a qualitative study of decision-making regarding isolation-based practices","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Asymptomatic and Presymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Infections in Residents of a Long-Term Care Skilled Nursing Facility : King County, Washington, March 2020","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Cultivating moral resilience","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Murray CJS.Moral courage in healthcare: Acting ethically even in the presence of risk.

Psychological impact was assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and mental health status was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21).\n Results: This study included 1210 respondents from 194 cities in China.\n In total, 53.8% of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe; 16.5% reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms; 28.8% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms; and 8.1% reported moderate to severe stress levels.\n Most respondents spent 20–24 h per day at home (84.7%); were worried about their family members contracting COVID-19 (75.2%); and were satisfied with the amount of health information available (75.1%).\n Female gender, student status, specific physical symptoms (e.\ng.\n, myalgia, dizziness, coryza), and poor self-rated health status were significantly associated with a greater psychological impact of the outbreak and higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p &lt;

China, more than half of the respondents rated the psychological impact as moderate-to-severe, and about one-third reported moderate-to-severe anxiety.\n Our findings identify factors associated with a lower level of psychological impact and better mental health status that can be used to formulate psychological interventions to improve the mental health of vulnerable groups during the COVID-19
