Data reported here were available in April 6th, 2020. Mortality was assessed in those who completed 15-days of ICU stay.\n\n\nResults\nWe identified 48 patients (27 males) with confirmed SARS-CoV-2. Median [interquartile range (IQR)] age of patients was 63 [51–75] years.\n\n Symptoms began a median of 7 [5–12] days before ICU admission.\n\n The most common comorbidities identified were obesity (48%), arterial hypertension (44%) and chronic lung disease (37%).\n\n All patients were admitted by hypoxemic respiratory failure and none received non-invasive mechanical ventilation.\n\n Forty-five (94%) underwent intubation, 3 (6%) high flow nasal therapy (HFNT), 1 (2%) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and 22 (46%) required prone position.\n\n After 15 days, 14/45 (31%) intubated patients died (13% within one week), 10/45 (22%) were extubated, and 21/45 (47%) underwent mechanical ventilation.\n\n Six patients had documented super-infection.\n\n Procalcitonin plasma above 0.5 ?g/L was associated with 16% vs.\n\n 19% (p = 0.78) risk of death after 7 days.\n\n\nConclusion\nThis early experience with SARS-CoV-2 in Spain suggests that a strategy of right oxygenation avoiding non-invasive mechanical ventilation was life-saving.\n\n Seven-day mortality in SARS-CoV-2 requiring intubation was lower than 15%, with 80% of patients still requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n After 15 days of ICU admission, half of patients remained intubated, whereas one third died.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7144603","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_elsevier_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Helena","surname":"Barrasa","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Jordi","surname":"Rello","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sofia","surname":"Tejada","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alejandro","surname":"Martín","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Goiatz","surname":"Balziskueta","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Cristina","surname":"Vinuesa","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Borja","surname":"Fernández-Miret","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ana","surname":"Villagra","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ana","surname":"Vallejo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ana","surname":"San Sebastián","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sara","surname":"Cabañes","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sebastián","surname":"Iribarren","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Fernando","surname":"Fonseca","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Javier","surname":"Maynar","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"                          NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References depth 1":[{"doi":"10.1016/j.iccn.2020.102812","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Strengthening ICU health security for a coronavirus epidemic","abstract":"","id":"PMC7135420","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Miia","surname":"Jansson","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xuelian","surname":"Liao","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Xuelian","surname":"Liao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jordi","surname":"Rello","email":"NULL","contributions":"4"},{"firstname":"Jordi","surname":"Rello","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Key Measures for SARS Preparedness and Response","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"CDC 2019. 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), Wuhan, China.

and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (?18

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or

creating much confusion and making comparisons difficult.\n\n Similarly, strong debate exists on the validity and clinical relevance of animal models of ARF; on choices of fluid management and of end-points for trials of new interventions in this field; and on how information technology can be used to assist this process.\n\n Accordingly, we sought to review the available evidence, make recommendations and delineate key questions for future studies.\n\n\nMethods\nWe undertook a systematic review of the literature using Medline and PubMed searches.\n\n We determined a list of key questions and convened a 2-day consensus conference to develop summary statements via a series of alternating breakout and plenary sessions.\n\n In these sessions, we identified supporting evidence and generated recommendations and/or directions for future research.\n\n\nResults\nWe found sufficient consensus on 47 questions to allow the development of recommendations.\n\n Importantly, we were

Concern (PHEIC).\n\n Clinical, laboratory, and imaging features have been partially characterized in some observational studies.\n\n No systematic reviews on COVID-19 have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed a systematic literature review with meta-analysis, using three databases to assess clinical, laboratory, imaging features, and outcomes of COVID-19 confirmed cases.\n\n Observational studies and also case reports, were included, and analyzed separately.\n\n We performed a random-effects model meta-analysis to calculate pooled prevalences and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI).\n\n\nResults\n660 articles were retrieved for the time frame (1/1/2020-2/23/2020).\n\n After screening, 27 articles were selected for full-text assessment, 19 being finally included for qualitative and quantitative analyses.\n\n Additionally, 39 case report articles were included and analyzed separately.\n\n For 656 patients, fever (88.7%, 95%CI 84.5–92.9%), cough (57.6%, 95%CI 40.8–74.4%) and dyspnea (45.6%, 95%CI 10.9–80.4%) were the most prevalent manifestations.\n\n Among the patients, 20.3% (95%CI 10.0–30.6%) required intensive care unit (ICU), 32.8% presented with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (95%CI 13.7–51.8), 6.2% (95%CI 3.1–9.3) with shock.\n\n Some 13.9% (95%CI 6.2–21.5%) of hospitalized patients had fatal outcomes (case fatality rate, CFR).\n\n\nConclusion\nCOVID-19 brings a huge burden to healthcare facilities, especially in patients with comorbidities.\n\n ICU was required for approximately 20% of polymorbid, COVID-19 infected patients and hospitalization was associated with a CFR of &gt;13%.\n\n As this virus spreads globally, countries need to urgently prepare human resources, infrastructure and facilities to treat severe

retrospective, observational study","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xiaobo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiqian","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huaqing","surname":"Shu","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Jia'an","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Yongran","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Lu","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhui","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Minghao","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yaxin","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Shangwen","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Xiaojing","surname":"Zou","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"Shiying","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"},{"firstname":"You","surname":"Shang","email":"NULL","contributions":"3"}],"References

The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without

expert consensus because of the risk of disseminated intravascular coagulation and venous thromboembolism.\n\n However, its efficacy remains to be validated.\n\n\nMethods\nCoagulation results, medications, and outcomes of consecutive patients being classified as having severe COVID?19 in Tongji hospital were retrospectively analyzed.\n\n The 28?day mortality between heparin users and nonusers were compared, as was a different risk of coagulopathy, which was stratified by the sepsis?induced coagulopathy (SIC) score or D?dimer result.\n\n\nResults\nThere were 449 patients with severe COVID?19 enrolled into the study, 99 of them received heparin (mainly with low molecular weight heparin) for 7 days or longer.\n\n D?dimer, prothrombin time, and age were positively, and platelet count was negatively, correlated with 28?day mortality in multivariate analysis.\n\n No difference in 28?day mortality was found between heparin users and nonusers (30.3% vs 29.7%,

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

concern.\n Herein, we investigated the extent of molecular divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and other related coronaviruses.\n Although we found only 4% variability in genomic nucleotides between SARS-CoV-2 and a bat SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV; RaTG13), the difference at neutral sites was 17%, suggesting the divergence between the two viruses is much larger than previously estimated.\n Our results suggest that the development of new variations in functional sites in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike seen in SARS-CoV-2 and viruses from pangolin SARSr-CoVs are likely caused by natural selection besides recombination.\n Population genetic analyses of 103 SARS-CoV-2 genomes indicated that these viruses had two major lineages (designated L and S), that are well defined by two different SNPs that show nearly complete linkage across the viral strains sequenced to date.\n We found that L lineage was more prevalent than the S lineage within the limited patient samples we examined.\n The implication of these evolutionary changes on disease etiology remains unclear.\n These findings strongly underscores the urgent need for further comprehensive studies that combine viral genomic data, with epidemiological studies of coronavirus disease 2019

2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical

Ultrasound May Support Diagnosis and Monitoring of COVID-19 Pneumonia","abstract":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19) is characterized by severe pneumonia and/or acute respiratory distress syndrome in about 20% of infected patients.\n Computed tomography (CT) is the routine imaging technique for diagnosis and monitoring of COVID-19 pneumonia.\n Chest CT has high sensitivity for diagnosis of COVID-19, but is not universally available, requires an infected or unstable patient to be moved to the radiology unit with potential exposure of several people, necessitates proper sanification of the CT room after use and is underutilized in children and pregnant women because of concerns over radiation exposure.\n The increasing frequency of confirmed COVID-19 cases is striking, and new sensitive diagnostic tools are needed to guide clinical practice.\n Lung ultrasound (LUS) is an emerging non-invasive bedside technique that is used to diagnose interstitial lung syndrome through evaluation and quantitation of the number of B-lines, pleural irregularities and nodules or consolidations.\n In patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, LUS reveals a typical pattern of diffuse interstitial lung syndrome, characterized by multiple or confluent bilateral B-lines with spared areas, thickening of the pleural line with pleural line irregularity and peripheral consolidations.\n LUS has been found to be a promising tool for the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia, and LUS findings correlate fairly with those of chest CT scan.\n Compared with CT, LUS has several other advantages, such as lack of exposure to radiation, bedside repeatability during follow-up, low cost and easier application in low-resource settings.\n Consequently, LUS may decrease utilization of conventional diagnostic imaging resources (CT scan and chest X-ray).\n LUS may help in early diagnosis, therapeutic decisions and follow-up monitoring of COVID-19 pneumonia, particularly in the critical care setting and in pregnant women, children and patients in areas with high rates of community

optimization for molecular detection of Zika virus","abstract":"Objective\nTo examine the diagnostic performance of real-time reverse transcription (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for Zika virus detection.\n\n\nMethods\nWe compared seven published real-time RT–PCR assays and two new assays that we have developed.\n\n To determine the analytical sensitivity of each assay, we constructed a synthetic universal control ribonucleic acid (uncRNA) containing all of the assays’ target regions on one RNA strand and spiked human blood or urine with known quantities of African or Asian Zika virus strains.\n\n Viral loads in 33 samples from Zika virus-infected patients were determined by using one of the new assays.\n\n\nFindings\nOligonucleotides of the published real-time RT–PCR assays, showed up to 10 potential mismatches with the Asian lineage causing the current outbreak, compared with 0 to 4 mismatches for the new assays.\n\n The 95% lower detection limit of the seven most sensitive assays ranged from 2.1 to 12.1 uncRNA copies/reaction.\n\n Two assays had lower sensitivities of 17.0 and 1373.3 uncRNA copies/reaction and showed a similar sensitivity when using spiked samples.\n\n The mean viral loads in samples from Zika virus-infected patients were 5?×?104 RNA copies/mL of blood and 2?×?104 RNA copies/mL of urine.\n\n\nConclusion\nWe provide reagents and updated protocols for Zika virus detection suitable for the current outbreak strains.\n\n Some published assays might be unsuitable for Zika virus detection, due to the limited sensitivity and potential incompatibility with some strains.\n\n Viral concentrations in the clinical samples were close to the technical detection limit, suggesting that the use of insensitive assays will cause false-negative results.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5153932","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Victor

severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) during its emergence in humans.\n In spite of intense study, it remains unclear whether the deletion actually reflects adaptation to humans.\n Here we engineered full, partially deleted (?29?nt), and fully deleted ORF8 into a SARS-CoV infectious cDNA clone, strain Frankfurt-1. Replication of the resulting viruses was compared in primate cell cultures as well as Rhinolophus bat cells made permissive for SARS-CoV replication by lentiviral transduction of the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor.\n Cells from cotton rat, goat, and sheep provided control scenarios that represent host systems in which SARS-CoV is neither endemic nor epidemic.\n Independent of the cell system, the truncation of ORF8 (29?nt deletion) decreased replication up to 23-fold.\n The effect was independent of the type I interferon response.\n The 29?nt deletion in SARS-CoV is a deleterious mutation acquired along the initial human-to-human transmission chain.\n The resulting loss of fitness may be due to a founder effect, which has rarely been documented in processes of viral emergence.\n These results have important implications for the retrospective assessment of the threat posed by SARS.\n","id":"PMC6181990","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Doreen","surname":"Muth","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Victor

infections in adults and children.\n While their clinical representation resembles that of many other agents of the common cold, their evolutionary histories, and host associations could provide important insights into the natural history of past human pandemics.\n For two of these viruses, we have strong evidence suggesting an origin in major livestock species while primordial associations for all four viruses may have existed with bats and rodents.\n HCoV-NL63 and -229E may originate from bat reservoirs as assumed for many other coronaviruses, but HCoV-OC43 and -HKU1 seem more likely to have speciated from rodent-associated viruses.\n HCoV-OC43 is thought to have emerged from ancestors in domestic animals such as cattle or swine.\n The bovine coronavirus has been suggested to be a possible ancestor, from which HCoV-OC43 may have emerged in the context of a pandemic recorded historically at the end of the 19th century.\n New data suggest that HCoV-229E may actually be transferred from dromedary camels similar to Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus.\n This scenario provides important ecological parallels to the present prepandemic pattern of host

data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on

to imprecise interpretations.\n We discuss the strengths and limitations of VFDs and other “failure-free day” composites, and we provide a framework for when and how to use these outcome measures.\n We also provide a comprehensive discussion of the different analytic methods for analyzing and interpreting VFDs, including Student’s t tests and rank-sum tests, as well as competing risk regressions

the effect size of an intervention, a statistical test and measure of confidence with the ability to adjust for baseline factors and allow interim monitoring for trials.\n We emphasize that any

PRISM score prior to NB-BAL, observations at the time of NB-BAL and arterial blood gases, oxygenation index (OI), ventilator settings, haemodynamic variables and temperature taken at 1 h before, and 1 and 6 h after NB-BAL, were retrieved from the archived computerised database.\n Results: Median age was 7 months (IQR 2.8–43 months) and median weight was 5.5 kg (IQR 4–14 kg).\n Four (7%) patients exhibited significant immediate complications, requiring escalation of respiratory or haemodynamic support.\n Forty-two (70%) patients had complete data for calculation of OI; there was no significant change in median OI at 1 and 6 h after NB-BAL.\n However 5 (12%) of these patients experienced an increase in OI of between 10 and 45 at 1 h post NB-BAL, which returned to baseline at 6 h post NB-BAL.\n Complications did not correlate with any of the available variables: baseline OI, PRISM score or with deterioration at the time of the procedure, although it was observed that four out of the six patients with baseline OIs of greater than 20 experienced complications.\n Conclusion: Non-bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage in critically ill mechanically ventilated neonates and children is generally a well-tolerated procedure, but for some patients, in whom it was not possible to elucidate predictive factors, complications developed.\n All patients, particularly those with OIs of greater than 20, require careful monitoring during and after the procedure.\n","id":"PMC7095174","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Margarita","surname":"Burmester","email":"margivan@hotmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Quen","surname":"Mok","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1097/PCC.0000000000000435","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Nonpulmonary Treatments for Pediatric Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome: Proceedings From the Pediatric Acute Lung Injury Consensus Conference","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1542/peds.2008-1987","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Functional Status Scale: new pediatric outcome measure","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.3389/fped.2016.00051","date":"2016-05-02","title":"Relevant Outcomes in Pediatric Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Studies","abstract":"Despite distinct epidemiology and outcomes, pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (PARDS) is often managed based on evidence extrapolated from treatment of adults.\n The impact of non-pulmonary processes on mortality as well as the lower mortality rate compared to adults with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) renders the utilization of short-term mortality as a primary outcome measure for interventional studies problematic.\n However, data regarding alternatives to mortality are profoundly understudied, and proposed alternatives, such as ventilator-free days, may be themselves subject to hidden biases.\n Given the neuropsychiatric and functional impairment in adult survivors of ARDS, characterization of these morbidities in children with PARDS is of paramount importance.\n The purpose of this review is to frame these challenges in the context of the existing pediatric literature, and using adult ARDS as a guide, suggest potential clinically relevant outcomes that deserve further investigation.\n The goal is to identify important areas of study in order to better define clinical practice and facilitate future interventional trials in PARDS.\n","id":"PMC4865511","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Nadir","surname":"Yehya","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Neal J.","surname":"Thomas","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1136/thorax.55.7.587","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Pediatric origins of adult lung disease. 1.

familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China,

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile

Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like

coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing Municipal Science and Technology

synthesis","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>The COVID-19 pandemic has placed an unprecedented strain on health systems, with rapidly increasing demand for healthcare in hospitals and intensive care units (ICUs) worldwide.\n\n As the pandemic escalates, determining the resulting needs for healthcare resources (beds, staff, equipment) has become a key priority for many countries.\n\n Projecting future demand requires estimates of how long patients with COVID-19 need different levels of hospital care.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>We performed a systematic review of early evidence on length of stay (LoS) of patients with COVID-19 in hospital and in ICU.\n\n We subsequently developed a method to generate LoS distributions which combines summary statistics reported in multiple studies, accounting for differences in sample sizes.\n\n Applying this approach, we provide distributions for total hospital and ICU LoS from studies in China and elsewhere, for use by the community.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>We identified 52 studies, the majority from China (46/52).\n\n Median hospital LoS ranged from 4 to 53 days within China, and 4 to 21 days outside of China, across 45 studies.\n\n ICU LoS was reported by eight studies—four each within and outside China—with median values ranging from 6 to 12 and 4 to 19 days, respectively.\n\n Our summary distributions have a median hospital LoS of 14 (IQR 10–19) days for China, compared with 5 (IQR 3–9) days outside of China.\n\n For ICU, the summary distributions are more similar (median (IQR) of 8 (5–13) days for China and 7 (4–11) days outside of China).\n\n There was a visible difference by discharge status, with patients who were discharged alive having longer LoS than those who died during their admission, but no trend associated with study date.\n\n\nConclusion\nid='Par4'>Patients with COVID-19 in China appeared to remain in hospital for longer than elsewhere.\n\n This may be explained by differences in criteria for admission and discharge between countries, and different timing within the pandemic.\n\n In the absence of local data, the combined summary LoS distributions provided here can be used to model bed demands for contingency planning and then updated, with the novel method presented here, as more studies with aggregated statistics emerge outside China.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7467845","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Eleanor

in several studies on China as 10?13 days.\n\n Global studies have indicated that the length of hospitalisation depends on different factors, such as the time elapsed from exposure to symptom onset, and from symptom onset to hospital admission, as well as specificities of the country under study.\n\n The goal of this paper is to identify factors associated with the median duration of hospital stays of COVID-19 patients during the second COVID-19 wave that hit Vietnam from 5 March to 8 April 2020.\nMethod\nWe used retrospective data on 133 hospitalised patients with COVID-19 recorded over at least two weeks during the study period.\n\n The Cox proportional-hazards regression model was applied to determine the potential risk factors associated with length of hospital stay.\n\n\nResults\nThere were 65 (48.9%) females, 98 (73.7%) patients 48 years old or younger, 15 (11.3%) persons with comorbidities, 21 (16.0%) severely ill patients and 5 (3.8%) individuals with life-threatening conditions.\n\n Eighty-two (61.7%) patients were discharged after testing negative for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, 51 were still in the hospital at the end of the study period and none

associated with longer duration of hospitalisation.\n\n\nConclusion\nA close look at how long COVID-19 patients stayed in the hospital could provide an overview of their treatment process in Vietnam,

pandemic","abstract":"Background:\nThe increased number of deaths in the community happening as a result of COVID-19 has caused primary healthcare services to change their traditional service delivery in a short timeframe.\n\n Services are quickly adapting to new challenges in the practical delivery of end-of-life care to patients in the community including through virtual consultations and in the provision of timely symptom control.\n\n\nAim:\nTo synthesise existing evidence related to the delivery of palliative and end-of-life care by primary healthcare professionals in epidemics and pandemics.\n\n\nDesign:\nRapid systematic review using modified systematic review methods, with narrative synthesis of the evidence.\n\n\nData sources:\nSearches were carried out in Medline, Embase, PsychINFO, CINAHL and Web of Science on 7th March 2020.\nResults:\nOnly five studies met the inclusion criteria, highlighting a striking lack of evidence base for the response of primary healthcare services in palliative care during epidemics and pandemics.\n\n All were observational studies.\n\n Findings were synthesised using a pandemic response framework according to ‘systems’ (community providers feeling disadvantaged in terms of receiving timely information and protocols), ‘space’ (recognised need for more care in the community), ‘staff’ (training needs and resilience) and ‘stuff’ (other aspects of managing care in pandemics including personal protective equipment, cleaning care settings and access to investigations).\n\n\nConclusions:\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic progresses,

of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing

decades, newly evolved Coronaviruses have posed a global threat to public health.\n The immune response is essential to control and eliminate CoV infections, however, maladjusted immune responses may result in immunopathology and impaired pulmonary gas exchange.\n Gaining a deeper understanding of the interaction between Coronaviruses and the innate immune systems of the hosts may shed light on the development and persistence of inflammation in the lungs and hopefully can reduce the risk of lung inflammation caused by CoVs.\n In this review, we provide an update on CoV infections and

study","abstract":"Background\nIn December, 2019, a pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China.\n\n We aimed to further clarify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data.\n\n Outcomes were followed up until Jan 25, 2020.\nFindings\nOf the 99 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, 49 (49%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market.\n\n The average age of the patients was 55·5 years (SD 13·1), including 67 men and 32 women.\n\n 2019-nCoV was detected in all patients by real-time RT-PCR.\n\n 50 (51%) patients had chronic diseases.\n\n Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (82 [83%] patients), cough (81 [82%] patients), shortness of breath (31 [31%] patients), muscle ache (11 [11%] patients), confusion (nine [9%] patients), headache (eight [8%] patients), sore throat (five [5%] patients), rhinorrhoea (four [4%] patients), chest pain (two [2%] patients), diarrhoea (two [2%] patients), and nausea and vomiting (one [1%] patient).\n\n According to imaging examination, 74 (75%) patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 14 (14%) patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity, and one (1%) patient had pneumothorax.\n\n 17 (17%) patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and, among them, 11 (11%) patients worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection was of clustering onset, is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n In general, characteristics of patients who died were in line with the MuLBSTA score, an early warning model for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia.\n\n Further investigation is needed to explore the applicability of the MuLBSTA score in predicting the risk of mortality in 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key R&amp;D Program of

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

mortality in critical illness: an observational cohort study","abstract":"Introduction\nThe neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a biological marker that has been shown to be associated with outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.\n\n Increasing quartile of NLR was statistically significantly associated with secondary outcome.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR is associated with outcomes in unselected critically ill patients.\n\n In patients with sepsis, there was no statistically significant relationship between NLR and mortality.\n\n Further investigation is required to increase understanding of the pathophysiology of this relationship and to validate these findings with data collected prospectively.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article

a major threat to public health1–3.\n Despite intense research efforts, how, when and where new diseases appear are still a source of considerable uncertainty.\n A severe respiratory disease was recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China5.\n This outbreak highlights the ongoing ability of viral spill-over from animals to cause severe disease in humans.\n","id":"PMC7094943","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Fan","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Su","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yan-Mei","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wen","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhi-Gang","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Wu","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Wu","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jun-Hua","surname":"Tian","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan-Yuan","surname":"Pei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ming-Li","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yu-Ling","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fa-Hui","surname":"Dai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi-Min","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiao-Jiao","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Edward

binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development

Unfortunately, there are few tools available to functionally test these viruses for their ability to infect humans, which has severely hampered efforts to predict the next zoonotic viral outbreak.\n Here, we developed an approach to rapidly screen lineage B betacoronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and the recent SARS-CoV-2, for receptor usage and their ability to infect cell types from different

adaption.\n Passaging virus on cells expressing this DPP4 variant led to accumulation of mutations in the viral spike which increased replication.\n Parallel passages revealed distinct paths of viral adaptation to the same DPP4 variant.\n Structural analysis and functional assays showed that these mutations enhanced viral entry with suboptimal DPP4 by altering the surface charge of spike.\n These

naturally infected or experimentally infected do not demonstrate clinical signs of disease.\n These observations have allowed researchers to speculate that bats are the likely reservoirs or ancestral hosts for several CoVs.\n In this review, we follow the CoV outbreaks that are speculated to have originated in bats.\n We review studies that have allowed researchers to identify unique adaptation in bats that may allow them to harbor CoVs without severe disease.\n We speculate about future studies that are critical to identify how bats can harbor multiple strains of CoVs and factors that enable these viruses to “jump” from bats to other mammals.\n We hope that this review will enable readers to identify gaps in knowledge that currently exist and initiate a dialogue amongst bat researchers to share resources to overcome present limitations.\n","id":"PMC6356540","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Arinjay","surname":"Banerjee","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kirsten","surname":"Kulcsar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Vikram","surname":"Misra","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Matthew","surname":"Frieman","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Karen","surname":"Mossman","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Fatal

provides new insights into the origin of SARS coronavirus","abstract":"A large number of SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoV) have been detected in horseshoe bats since 2005 in different areas of China.\n However, these bat SARSr-CoVs show sequence differences from SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in different genes (S, ORF8, ORF3, etc) and are considered unlikely to represent the direct progenitor of SARS-CoV.\n Herein, we report the findings of our 5-year surveillance of SARSr-CoVs in a cave inhabited by multiple species of horseshoe bats in Yunnan Province, China.\n The full-length genomes of 11 newly discovered SARSr-CoV strains, together with our previous findings, reveals that the SARSr-CoVs circulating in this single location are highly diverse in the S gene, ORF3 and ORF8. Importantly, strains with high genetic similarity to SARS-CoV in the hypervariable N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 gene, the ORF3 and ORF8 region, respectively, were all discovered in this cave.\n In addition, we report the first discovery of bat SARSr-CoVs highly similar to human SARS-CoV in ORF3b and in the split ORF8a and 8b.\n Moreover, SARSr-CoV strains from this cave were more closely related to SARS-CoV in the non-structural protein genes ORF1a and 1b compared with those detected elsewhere.\n Recombination analysis shows evidence of frequent recombination events within the S gene and around the ORF8 between these SARSr-CoVs.\n We hypothesize that the direct progenitor of SARS-CoV may have originated after sequential recombination events between the precursors of these SARSr-CoVs.\n Cell entry studies demonstrated that three newly identified SARSr-CoVs with different S protein sequences are all able to use human ACE2 as the receptor, further exhibiting the close relationship between strains in this cave and SARS-CoV.\n This work provides new insights into the origin and evolution of SARS-CoV and highlights the necessity of preparedness for future emergence of SARS-like diseases.\n","id":"PMC5708621","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ben","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei-Ping","surname":"Zeng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xing-Lou","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xing-Yi","surname":"Ge","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bei","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jia-Zheng","surname":"Xie","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xu-Rui","surname":"Shen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yun-Zhi","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ning","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dong-Sheng","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiao-Shuang","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mei-Niang","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peter","surname":"Daszak","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin-Fa","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin-Fa","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jie","surname":"Cui","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng-Li","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng-Li","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christian","surname":"Drosten","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christian","surname":"Drosten","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christian","surname":"Drosten","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa030747","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Identification

deaths reported from Saudi Arabia.\n\n In addition to confirming diagnosis, we generated the MERS-CoV genomic sequences obtained directly from patient samples to provide important information on

from 21 MERS cases of which 13 had 100%, four 85–95%, and four 30–50% genome coverage.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of the 21 sequences, combined with nine published MERS-CoV genomes, was done.\n\n\nFindings\nThree distinct MERS-CoV genotypes were identified in Riyadh.\n\n Phylogeographic analyses suggest the MERS-CoV zoonotic reservoir is geographically disperse.\n\n Selection analysis of the MERS-CoV genomes reveals the expected accumulation of genetic diversity including changes in the S protein.\n\n The genetic diversity in the Al-Hasa cluster suggests that the hospital

coronaviruses provides new insights into the origin of SARS coronavirus","abstract":"A large number of SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoV) have been detected in horseshoe bats since 2005 in different areas of China.\n However, these bat SARSr-CoVs show sequence differences from SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in different genes (S, ORF8, ORF3, etc) and are considered unlikely to represent the direct progenitor of SARS-CoV.\n Herein, we report the findings of our 5-year surveillance of SARSr-CoVs in a cave inhabited by multiple species of horseshoe bats in Yunnan Province, China.\n The full-length genomes of 11 newly discovered SARSr-CoV strains, together with our previous findings, reveals that the SARSr-CoVs circulating in this single location are highly diverse in the S gene, ORF3 and ORF8. Importantly, strains with high genetic similarity to SARS-CoV in the hypervariable N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 gene, the ORF3 and ORF8 region, respectively, were all discovered in this cave.\n In addition, we report the first discovery of bat SARSr-CoVs highly similar to human SARS-CoV in ORF3b and in the split ORF8a and 8b.\n Moreover, SARSr-CoV strains from this cave were more closely related to SARS-CoV in the non-structural protein genes ORF1a and 1b compared with those detected elsewhere.\n Recombination analysis shows evidence of frequent recombination events within the S gene and around the ORF8 between these SARSr-CoVs.\n We hypothesize that the direct progenitor of SARS-CoV may have originated after sequential recombination events between the precursors of these SARSr-CoVs.\n Cell entry studies demonstrated that three newly identified SARSr-CoVs with different S protein sequences are all able to use human ACE2 as the receptor, further exhibiting the close relationship between strains in this cave and SARS-CoV.\n This work provides new insights into the origin and evolution of SARS-CoV and highlights the necessity of preparedness for future emergence of SARS-like diseases.\n","id":"PMC5708621","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ben","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei-Ping","surname":"Zeng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xing-Lou","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xing-Yi","surname":"Ge","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bei","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jia-Zheng","surname":"Xie","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xu-Rui","surname":"Shen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yun-Zhi","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ning","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dong-Sheng","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiao-Shuang","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mei-Niang","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peter","surname":"Daszak","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin-Fa","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin-Fa","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jie","surname":"Cui","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng-Li","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng-Li","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christian","surname":"Drosten","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christian","surname":"Drosten","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christian","surname":"Drosten","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1128/JVI.06882-11","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Evidence for a common evolutionary origin of coronavirus spike protein receptor-binding subunits","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1126/science.1116480","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Structure of SARS coronavirus spike receptor-binding domain complexed with receptor","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00255","date":"1970-01-01","title":"ff14SB: improving the accuracy of protein side chain and backbone parameters from ff99SB","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1038/nature12005","date":"2013-02-13","title":"Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 is a functional receptor for the emerging human coronavirus-EMC","abstract":"Supplementary information\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1038/nature12005) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7095326","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"V.

identified the major pathological changes in the respiratory and immune systems of patients who died of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) but gained little information on the organ distribution of SARS?associated coronavirus (SARS?CoV).\n In the present study, we used a murine monoclonal antibody specific for SARS?CoV nucleoprotein, and probes specific for a SARS?CoV RNA polymerase gene fragment, for immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, respectively, to detect SARS?CoV systematically in tissues from patients who died of SARS.\n SARS?CoV was found in lung, trachea/bronchus, stomach, small intestine, distal convoluted renal tubule, sweat gland, parathyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal gland, liver and cerebrum, but was not detected in oesophagus, spleen, lymph node, bone marrow, heart, aorta, cerebellum, thyroid, testis, ovary, uterus or muscle.\n These results suggest that, in addition to the respiratory system, the gastrointestinal tract and other organs with detectable SARS?CoV may also be targets of SARS?CoV infection.\n The pathological changes in these organs may be caused directly by the cytopathic effect mediated by local replication of the SARS?CoV; or indirectly as a result of systemic responses to respiratory failure or the harmful immune response induced by viral infection.\n In addition to viral spread through a respiratory route, SARS?CoV in the intestinal tract, kidney and sweat glands may be excreted via faeces, urine and sweat, thereby leading to virus transmission.\n This study provides important information for understanding the pathogenesis of SARS?CoV infection and sheds light on possible virus transmission pathways.\n This data will be useful for designing new strategies for prevention and treatment of SARS.\n Copyright ©

similar trends in reactive mesothelia.\n This finding suggests that preexisting pulmonary disease could increase MERS-CoV receptor abundance and predispose individuals to MERS morbidity and mortality,

syndrome.\n\n\nBackground\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly emerged infection from a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV).\n\n Apart from fever and respiratory complications, acute renal impairment has been observed in some patients with SARS.\n\n Herein, we describe the clinical, pathologic, and laboratory features of the acute renal impairment complicating this new viral infection.\n\n\nMethods\nWe conducted a retrospective analysis of the plasma creatinine concentration and other clinical parameters of the 536 SARS patients with normal plasma creatinine at first clinical presentation, admitted to two regional hospitals following a major outbreak in Hong Kong in March 2003. Kidney tissues from seven other patients with postmortem examinations were studied by light microscopy and electron microscopy.\n\n\nResults\nAmong these 536 patients with SARS, 36 (6.7%) developed acute renal impairment occurring at a median duration of 20 days (range 5–48 days) after the onset of viral infection despite a normal plasma creatinine level at first clinical presentation.\n\n The acute renal impairment reflected the different prerenal and renal factors that exerted renal insult occurring in the context of multiorgan failure.\n\n Eventually, 33 SARS patients (91.7%) with acute renal impairment died.\n\n The mortality rate was significantly higher among patients with SARS and acute renal impairment compared with those with SARS and no renal impairment (91.7% vs.\n\n 8.8%) (P &lt;

viruses isolated from human (huSARS-CoV) and those of palm civet origin (pcSARS-CoV) suggested possible palm civet-to-human transmission.\n Genetic analysis revealed that the spike (S) protein of pcSARS-CoV and huSARS-CoV was subjected to the strongest positive selection pressure during transmission, and there were six amino acid residues within the receptor-binding domain of the S protein being potentially important for SARS progression and tropism.\n Using the single-round infection assay, we found that a two-amino acid substitution (N479K/T487S) of a huSARS-CoV for those of pcSARS-CoV almost abolished its infection of human cells expressing the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 but no effect upon the infection of mouse ACE2 cells.\n Although single substitution of these two residues had no effects on the infectivity of huSARS-CoV, these recombinant S proteins bound to human ACE2 with different levels of reduced affinity, and the two-amino acid-substituted S protein showed extremely low affinity.\n On the contrary, substitution of these two amino acid residues of pcSARS-CoV for those of huSRAS-CoV made pcSARS-CoV capable of infecting human ACE2-expressing cells.\n These results suggest that amino acid residues at position 479 and 487 of the S protein are important determinants for SARS-CoV tropism and animal-to-human

Our results show that MERS-CoV RBD consists of a core and a receptor-binding subdomain.\n The receptor-binding subdomain interacts with DPP4 ?-propeller but not its intrinsic hydrolase domain.\n MERS-CoV RBD and related SARS-CoV RBD share a high degree of structural similarity in their core subdomains, but are notably divergent in the receptor-binding subdomain.\n Mutagenesis studies have identified several key residues in the receptor-binding subdomain that are critical for viral binding to DPP4 and entry into the target cell.\n The atomic details at the interface between MERS-CoV RBD and DPP4 provide structural understanding of the virus and receptor interaction, which can guide development of therapeutics and vaccines against MERS-CoV infection.\n","id":"PMC3731569","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Nianshuang","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuanling","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Liwei","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Senyan","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dongli","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Pei","surname":"Tong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dongxing","surname":"Guo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lili","surname":"Fu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ye","surname":"Cui","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xi","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kelly C","surname":"Arledge","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ying-Hua","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Linqi","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xinquan","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1586/14760584.2014.912134","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Current advancements and potential strategies in the development of MERS-CoV vaccines","abstract":"Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a newly emerging infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus, MERS-coronavirus (MERS-CoV), a new member in the lineage C of ?-coronavirus (?-CoV).\n The increased human cases and high mortality rate of MERS-CoV infection make it essential to develop safe and effective vaccines.\n In this review, the current advancements and potential strategies in the development of MERS vaccines, particularly subunit vaccines based on MERS-CoV spike (S) protein and its receptor-binding domain (RBD), are discussed.\n How to improve the efficacy of subunit vaccines through novel adjuvant formulations and routes of administration as well as currently available animal models for evaluating the in vivo efficacy of MERS-CoV vaccines are also addressed.\n Overall, these strategies may have important implications for the development of effective and safe vaccines for MERS-CoV in the future.\n","id":"PMC4241375","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Naru","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shibo","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lanying","surname":"Du","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1128/JVI.01048-13","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Identification of a receptor-binding domain in the S protein of the novel human coronavirus Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus as an essential target for vaccine development","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1038/nature12005","date":"2013-02-13","title":"Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 is a functional receptor for the emerging human coronavirus-EMC","abstract":"Supplementary information\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1038/nature12005) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7095326","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"V.

Efficacy in Senescent Mice Challenged with Recombinant SARS-CoV Bearing Epidemic and Zoonotic Spike Variants ","abstract":"Background\nIn 2003, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identified as the etiological agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome, a disease characterized by severe pneumonia that sometimes results in death.\n\n SARS-CoV is a zoonotic virus that crossed the species barrier, most likely originating from bats or from other species including civets, raccoon dogs, domestic cats, swine, and rodents.\n\n A SARS-CoV vaccine should confer long-term protection, especially in vulnerable senescent populations, against both the 2003 epidemic strains and zoonotic strains that may yet emerge from animal reservoirs.\n\n We report the comprehensive investigation of SARS vaccine efficacy in young and senescent mice following homologous and heterologous challenge.\n\n\nMethods and Findings\nUsing Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicon particles (VRP) expressing the 2003 epidemic Urbani SARS-CoV strain spike (S) glycoprotein (VRP-S) or the nucleocapsid (N) protein from the same strain (VRP-N), we demonstrate that VRP-S, but not VRP-N vaccines provide complete short- and long-term protection against homologous strain challenge in young and senescent mice.\n\n To test VRP vaccine efficacy against a heterologous SARS-CoV, we used phylogenetic analyses, synthetic biology, and reverse genetics to construct a chimeric virus (icGDO3-S) encoding a synthetic S glycoprotein gene of the most genetically divergent human strain, GDO3, which clusters among the zoonotic SARS-CoV.\n\n icGD03-S replicated efficiently in human airway epithelial cells and in the lungs of young and senescent mice, and was highly resistant to neutralization with antisera directed against the Urbani strain.\n\n Although VRP-S vaccines provided complete short-term protection against heterologous icGD03-S challenge in young mice, only limited protection was seen in vaccinated senescent animals.\n\n VRP-N vaccines not only failed to protect from homologous or heterologous challenge, but resulted in enhanced immunopathology with eosinophilic infiltrates within the lungs of SARS-CoV–challenged mice.\n\n VRP-N–induced pathology presented at day 4, peaked around day 7, and persisted through day 14, and was likely mediated by cellular immune responses.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis study identifies gaps and challenges in vaccine design for controlling future SARS-CoV zoonosis, especially in vulnerable elderly populations.\n\n The availability of a SARS-CoV virus bearing heterologous S glycoproteins provides a robust challenge inoculum for evaluating vaccine efficacy against zoonotic strains, the most likely source of future outbreaks.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1716185","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Damon","surname":"Deming","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Timothy","surname":"Sheahan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mark","surname":"Heise","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Boyd","surname":"Yount","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nancy","surname":"Davis","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Amy","surname":"Sims","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mehul","surname":"Suthar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jack","surname":"Harkema","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Alan","surname":"Whitmore","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Raymond","surname":"Pickles","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ande","surname":"West","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Eric","surname":"Donaldson","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kristopher","surname":"Curtis","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Robert","surname":"Johnston","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ralph","surname":"Baric","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Joseph","surname":"Peiris","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Joseph","surname":"Peiris","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1128/JVI.79.5.2678-2688.2005","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Recombinant

evaluating a recombinant receptor-binding domain (rRBD) protein vaccine in a rhesus macaque model.\n\n\nMethods\nNine monkeys were randomly assigned to high-dose, low-dose and mock groups,which were immunized with different doses of rRBD plus alum adjuvant or adjuvant alone at different time points (0, 8, 25 weeks).\n\n Immunological analysis was conducted after each immunisation.\n\n Monkeys were challenged with MERS-CoV at 14 days after the final immunisation followed by observation for clinical signs and chest X-rays.\n\n Nasal, oropharyngeal and rectal swabs were also collected for analyses.\n\n Monkeys were euthanized 3 days after challenge and multiple specimens from tissues were collected for pathological, virological and immunological tests.\n\n\nConclusion\nRobust and sustained immunological responses (including neutralisation antibody) were elicited by the rRBD vaccination.\n\n Besides, rRBD vaccination alleviated pneumonia with evidence of reduced tissue

elicited strong T cell IL-4 but minimal IFN-? responses and a much greater antibody response.\n Despite these differences, however, the immunodominant T-cell ELISpot responses to each of the three immunogens were elicited by the same N peptides, with the greatest responses being generated by a cluster of five overlapping peptides, N76–114, each of which contained nonameric H2d binding domains

profiles of T-cell responses were distinctly different.\n The pronounced Th-2 and humoral response to N protein plus adjuvant are in contrast to the balanced IFN-? and IL-4 responses and strong memory

used for SARS-infected patients in order to guide future treatment and identify priorities for research.\n\n\nMethods and Findings\nIn response to the WHO request we conducted a systematic review of the published literature on ribavirin, corticosteroids, lopinavir and ritonavir (LPV/r), type I interferon (IFN), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and SARS convalescent plasma from both in vitro studies and in SARS patients.\n\n We also searched for clinical trial evidence of treatment for acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n Sources of data were the literature databases MEDLINE, EMBASE,

it was not possible to determine whether treatments benefited patients during the SARS outbreak.\n\n Some may have been harmful.\n\n Clinical trials should be designed to validate a standard protocol

Cell Response and Severe Disease in SARS-CoV-Infected Mice","abstract":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome caused substantial morbidity and mortality during the 2002–2003 epidemic.\n Many of the features of the human disease are duplicated in BALB/c mice infected with a mouse-adapted version of the virus (MA15), which develop respiratory disease with high morbidity and mortality.\n Here, we show that severe disease is correlated with slow kinetics of virus clearance and delayed activation and transit of respiratory dendritic cells (rDC) to the draining lymph nodes (DLN) with a consequent deficient virus-specific T cell response.\n All of these defects are corrected when mice are treated with liposomes containing clodronate, which deplete alveolar macrophages (AM).\n Inhibitory AMs are believed to prevent the development of immune responses to environmental antigens and allergic responses by interacting with lung dendritic cells and T cells.\n The inhibitory effects of AM can also be nullified if mice or AMs are pretreated with poly I:C, which directly activate AMs and rDCs through toll-like receptors 3 (TLR3).\n Further, adoptive transfer of activated but not resting bone marrow–derived dendritic cells (BMDC) protect mice from lethal MA15 infection.\n These results may be relevant for SARS in humans, which is also characterized by prolonged virus persistence and delayed development of a SARS-CoV-specific immune response in individuals with severe disease.\n","id":"PMC2762542","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jincun","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jingxian","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nico","surname":"Van

Is Required for Protection from Lethal Infection with a Mouse-Adapted SARS-CoV","abstract":"A novel human coronavirus, SARS-CoV, emerged suddenly in 2003, causing approximately 8000 human cases and more than 700 deaths worldwide.\n Since most animal models fail to faithfully recapitulate the clinical course of SARS-CoV in humans, the virus and host factors that mediate disease pathogenesis remain unclear.\n Recently, our laboratory and others developed a recombinant mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (rMA15) that was lethal in BALB/c mice.\n In contrast, intranasal infection of young 10-week-old C57BL/6 mice with rMA15 results in a nonlethal infection characterized by high titer replication within the lungs, lung inflammation, destruction of lung tissue, and loss of body weight, thus providing a useful model to identify host mediators of protection.\n Here, we report that mice deficient in MyD88 (MyD88?/?), an adapter protein that mediates Toll-like receptor (TLR), IL-1R, and IL-18R signaling, are far more susceptible to rMA15 infection.\n The genetic absence of MyD88 resulted in enhanced pulmonary pathology and greater than 90% mortality by day 6 post-infection.\n MyD88?/? mice had significantly higher viral loads in lung tissue throughout the course of infection.\n Despite increased viral loads, the expression of multiple proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines within lung tissue and recruitment of inflammatory monocytes/macrophages to the lung was severely impaired in MyD88?/? mice compared to wild-type mice.\n Furthermore, mice deficient in chemokine receptors that contribute to monocyte recruitment to the lung were more susceptible to rMA15-induced disease and exhibited severe lung pathology similar to that seen in MyD88?/?mice.\n These data suggest that MyD88-mediated innate immune signaling and inflammatory cell recruitment to the lung are required for protection from lethal rMA15 infection.\n","id":"PMC2587915","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Timothy","surname":"Sheahan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Thomas

coronavirus and respiratory mucosal cells drives viral dissemination in rhesus macaques","abstract":"Innate immune responses have a critical role in the control of early virus replication and dissemination.\n It remains unknown, however, how severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) evades respiratory innate immunity to establish a systemic infection.\n Here we show in Chinese macaques that SARS-CoV traversed the mucosa through the respiratory tract within 2 days, resulting in extensive mucosal infiltration by T cells, MAC387+, and CD163+ monocytes/macrophages followed by limited viral replication in the lung but persistent viral shedding into the upper airway.\n Mucosal monocytes/macrophages sequestered virions in intracellular vesicles together with infected Langerhans cells and migrated into the tonsils and/or draining lymph nodes within 2 days.\n In lymphoid tissues, viral RNA and proteins were detected in infected monocytes upon differentiation into dendritic cells (DCs) within 3 days.\n Systemic viral dissemination was observed within 7 days.\n This study provides a comprehensive overview of the spatiotemporal interactions of SARS-CoV, monocytes/macrophages, and the DC network in mucosal tissues and highlights the fact that, while these innate cells contribute to viral clearance, they probably also serve as shelters and vehicles to provide a mechanism for the virus to escape host mucosal innate immunity and disseminate systemically.\n","id":"PMC4900951","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"L","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Q","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"K","surname":"Nishiura","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"J","surname":"Peng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"H","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"C","surname":"Midkiff","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"X","surname":"Alvarez","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"C","surname":"Qin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"A","surname":"Lackner","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Z","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1038/423240a","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Koch's

in 41 (12%) of 335, and other respiratory pathogens were diagnosed only sporadically.\n\n SARS-CoV was, therefore, the most likely causal agent of SARS.\n\n The four SARS-CoV-infected macaques

relevant parameters of SARS-CoV infection in NHPs, we infected cynomolgus macaques with SARS-CoV in three groups: Group I was infected in the nares and bronchus, group II in the nares and conjunctiva, and group III intravenously.\n\n Nonhuman primates in groups I and II developed mild to moderate symptomatic illness.\n\n All NHPs demonstrated evidence of viral replication and developed neutralizing

not significantly changed.\n\n Overall, inoculation by a mucosal route produced more prominent disease than did intravenous inoculation.\n\n Half of the group I animals were infected with a

Since these changes do not interact with the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV, rh-ACE2 in general is as effective as human homolog in supporting viral entry.\n Rh-ACE2, however, is more polymorphic than hu-ACE2. Additional sporadic NS substitutions in clone Rh11-7 reduced the level of rh-ACE2 protein expression and did not support viral entry effectively.\n Further mutagenesis analysis showed that a natural mutation Y217N dramatically alters ACE2 expression and entry efficiency.\n Moreover, introduction of the Y217N mutation into hu-ACE2 caused the down-regulation of expression and reduced viral entry efficiency.\n These results indicate that the Y217N mutation plays a role in modulating SARS-CoV infection.\n Our results provide insights for understanding the role of rh-ACE2 in SARS lung

Taken together, this study characterizes the tropism of MERS-CoV upon infection.\n Importantly, this hDPP4-expressing transgenic mouse model will be applicable for studying the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV infection and investigating the efficacy of vaccines and antiviral agents designed to combat MERS-CoV infection.\n","id":"PMC4689477","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Guangyu","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuting","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hongjie","surname":"Qiu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tongtong","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Zeng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yan","surname":"Guo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Junfeng","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhihua","surname":"Kou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lanying","surname":"Du","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wenjie","surname":"Tan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shibo","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shihui","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yusen","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Stefan","surname":"Pöhlmann","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Stefan","surname":"Pöhlmann","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1073/pnas.1323279111","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Rapid generation of a mouse model for Middle East respiratory syndrome","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1128/JVI.01702-06","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection of mice transgenic for the human Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 virus receptor","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1038/nmicrobiol.2016.226","date":"2016-10-14","title":"A mouse model for MERS coronavirus-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome","abstract":"Supplementary information\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1038/nmicrobiol.\n\n2016.226) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5578707","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Adam S.","surname":"Cockrell","email":"adam_cockrell@unc.edu","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Boyd L.","surname":"Yount","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Trevor","surname":"Scobey","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kara","surname":"Jensen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Madeline","surname":"Douglas","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Anne","surname":"Beall","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xian-Chun","surname":"Tang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wayne A.","surname":"Marasco","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mark T.","surname":"Heise","email":"mark_heisem@med.unc.edu","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ralph S.","surname":"Baric","email":"rbaric@email.unc.edu","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1126/science.aad1283","date":"1970-01-01","title":"An orthopoxvirus-based vaccine reduces virus excretion after MERS-CoV infection in dromedary camels","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.3201/eid2206.160192","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Infection, Replication, and Transmission of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus in Alpacas","abstract":"These animals might be useful surrogates for camels in laboratory studies of this virus.\n","id":"PMC4880070","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Danielle R.","surname":"Adney","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Helle","surname":"Bielefeldt-Ohmann","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Airn E.","surname":"Hartwig","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Richard A.","surname":"Bowen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.3201/eid2206.160007","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Experimental Infection and Response to Rechallenge of Alpacas with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","abstract":"We conducted a challenge/rechallenge trial in which 3 alpacas were infected with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus.\n The alpacas shed virus at challenge but were refractory to further shedding at rechallenge on day 21.

rhesus macaque and common marmoset animal models of MERS-CoV infection.\n The main histopathological findings in the lungs of rhesus macaques and common marmosets were varying degrees of pulmonary lesions, including pneumonia, pulmonary oedema, haemorrhage, degeneration and necrosis of the pneumocytes and bronchial epithelial cells, and inflammatory cell infiltration.\n The characteristic inflammatory cells in the lungs of rhesus macaques and common marmosets were eosinophils and neutrophils, respectively.\n Based on these observations, the lungs of rhesus macaques and common marmosets appeared to develop chronic and acute pneumonia, respectively.\n MERS-CoV antigens and viral RNA were identified in type I and II pneumocytes, alveolar macrophages and bronchial epithelial cells, and ultrastructural observations showed that viral protein was found in type II pneumocytes and inflammatory cells in both species.\n Correspondingly, the entry receptor DDP4 was found in type I and II pneumocytes, bronchial epithelial cells, and alveolar macrophages.\n The rhesus macaque and common marmoset animal models of MERS-CoV can be used as a tool to mimic the oncome of MERS-CoV infections

infections","abstract":"Background\nid='Par1'>Sex differences are important epidemiological factors that impact in the frequency and severity of infectious diseases.\n\n A clear sexual dimorphism in bacterial infections has been reported in both humans and animal models.\n\n Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms involved in this gender bias are just starting to be elucidated.\n\n In the present article, we aim to review the available data in the literature that report bacterial infections presenting a clear sexual dimorphism, without considering behavioral and social factors.\n\n\nMain body\nid='Par2'>The sexual dimorphism in bacterial infections has been mainly attributed to the differential levels of sex hormones between males and females, as well as to genetic factors.\n\n In general, males are more susceptible to gastrointestinal and respiratory bacterial diseases and sepsis, while females are more susceptible to genitourinary tract bacterial infections.\n\n However, these incidences depend on the population evaluated, animal model and the bacterial species.\n\n Female protection against bacterial infections and the associated complications is assumed to be due to the pro-inflammatory effect of estradiol, while male susceptibility to those infections is associated with the testosterone-mediated immune suppression, probably via their specific receptors.\n\n Recent studies indicate that the protective effect of estradiol depends on the estrogen receptor subtype and the specific tissue compartment involved in the bacterial insult, suggesting that tissue-specific expression of particular sex steroid receptors contributes to the susceptibility to bacterial infections.\n\n Furthermore, this gender bias also depends on the effects of sex hormones on specific bacterial species.\n\n Finally, since a large number of genes related to immune functions are located on the X chromosome, X-linked mosaicism confers a highly polymorphic gene expression program that allows women to respond with a more expanded immune repertoire as compared with men.\n\n\nConclusion\nid='Par3'>Notwithstanding there is increasing evidence that confirms the sexual dimorphism in certain bacterial infections and the molecular mechanisms associated, further studies are required to clarify conflicting data and to determine the role of specific hormone receptors involved in the gender bias of bacterial infections, as well as their potential as therapeutic targets.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6011518","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Edgar

the association between sex and clinical outcome in sepsis patients in a large, diverse population.\n\n\nMaterials and Methods:\nWe analyzed 6,134 adult patients with sepsis from the critical care units of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center between 2001 and 2012. Study data were retrospectively extracted from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III, a multiparameter intensive care database.\n\n\nResults:\nThere were 2,677 (43.6%) female and 3,457 (56.4%) male patients.\n\n Compared with female patients, male patients with sepsis had a higher 1-year mortality rate (55.6% vs.\n\n 51.4%, P?=?0.001), and so did the 90-day mortality rate (45.1% vs.\n\n 42.1%, P?=?0.018).\n\n 33.8% of male and 31.3% of female patients with sepsis died during hospitalization (P?=?0.041).\n\n The median length of hospitalization and intensive care unit (ICU) stay for male patients was 19.54 and 7.54 days, while that for female patients was 16.49 and 6.75 days (P?&lt;?0.001, P?=?0.002, respectively).\n\n Male patients were more likely to require dialysis

endocrinological changes at least twice during their lifetime, puberty and menopause, with many women undergoing an additional transition: pregnancy, which may or may not be accompanied by breastfeeding.\n These endocrinological transitions exert significant effects on the immune system due to interactions between the hormonal milieu, innate, and adaptive immune systems as well as pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, and thereby modulate the susceptibility of women to autoimmune diseases.\n Conversely, pre-existing autoimmune diseases themselves impact endocrine transitions.\n Concentration-dependent effects of estrogen on the immune system; the role of progesterone, androgens, leptin, oxytocin, and prolactin; and the interplay between Th1 and Th2 immune responses together maintain a delicate balance between host defense, immunological tolerance and autoimmunity.\n In this review, multiple autoimmune diseases have been analyzed in the context of each of the three endocrinological transitions in women.\n We provide evidence from human epidemiological data and animal studies that endocrine transitions exert profound impact on the development of autoimmune diseases in women through complex mechanisms.\n Greater understanding of endocrine transitions and their role in autoimmune diseases could aid in prediction, prevention, and cures of these

stromal fibroblast (eSF) is a master regulator of pregnancy success.\n However, the complex hormone-epigenome-transcriptome interplay in eSF by each individual steroid hormone, estradiol (E2) and/or progesterone (P4), under physiologic and pathophysiologic conditions, is poorly understood and was investigated herein.\n Genome-wide analysis in normal, early and late stage eutopic eSF revealed: i) In contrast to P4, E2 extensively affected the eSF DNA methylome and transcriptome.\n Importantly, E2 resulted in a more open versus closed chromatin, confirmed by histone modification analysis.\n Combined E2 with P4 affected a totally different landscape than E2 or P4 alone.\n ii) P4 responses were aberrant in early and late stage endometriosis, and mapping differentially methylated CpG sites with progesterone receptor targets from the literature revealed different but not decreased P4-targets, leading to question the P4-“resistant” phenotype in endometriosis.\n Interestingly, an aberrant E2-response was noted in eSF from endometriosis women; iii) Steroid hormones affected specific genomic contexts and locations, significantly enriching enhancers and intergenic regions and minimally involving proximal promoters and CpG islands, regardless of hormone type and eSF disease state.\n iv) In eSF from women with endometriosis, aberrant hormone-induced methylation signatures were mainly due to existing DNA methylation marks prior to hormone treatments and involved known endometriosis genes and pathways.\n v) Distinct DNA methylation and transcriptomic signatures revealed early and late stage endometriosis comprise unique disease subtypes.\n Taken together, the data herein, for the first time, provide significant insight into the hormone-epigenome-transcriptome interplay of each steroid hormone in normal eSF, and aberrant E2 response, distinct disease subtypes, and pre-existing epigenetic aberrancies in the setting of endometriosis, provide mechanistic insights into how endometriosis affects endometrial function/dysfunction.\n","id":"PMC7299312","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Sahar","surname":"Houshdaran","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ashwini

that occur during puberty have been implicated in susceptibility to a wide range of diseases later in life, many of which are characterized by sex-specific differences in prevalence.\n\n Both genetic and environmental factors have been associated with the onset or delay of puberty, and recent evidence has suggested a role for epigenetic changes in the initiation of puberty as well.\n\n\nObjective\nid='Par2'>To identify global DNA methylation changes that arise across the window of puberty in girls and boys.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par3'>Genome-wide DNA methylation levels were measured using the Infinium 450K array.\n\n We focused our studies on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 30 girls and 25 boys pre- and post-puberty (8 and 14 years, respectively), in whom puberty status was confirmed by Tanner staging.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par4'>Our study revealed 347 differentially methylated probes (DMPs) in females and 50 DMPs in males between the ages of 8 and 14 years (FDR 5%).\n\n The female DMPs were in or near 312 unique genes, which were over-represented for having high affinity estrogen response elements (permutation P?&lt;?2.0?×?10?6), suggesting that some of the effects of estrogen signaling in puberty are modified through epigenetic mechanisms.\n\n Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of the 312 genes near female puberty DMPs revealed significant networks enriched for immune and inflammatory responses as well as reproductive hormone signaling.\n\n Finally, analysis of gene expression in the female PBMCs collected at 14 years revealed modules of correlated transcripts that were enriched for immune and reproductive system functions, and include genes that are responsive to estrogen and androgen receptor signaling.\n\n The male DMPs were in or near 48 unique genes, which were enriched for adrenaline and noradrenaline biosynthesis (Enrichr P?=?0.021), with no significant networks identified.\n\n Additionally, no modules were identified using post-puberty gene expression levels in males.\n\n\nConclusion\nid='Par5'>Epigenetic changes spanning the window of puberty in females may be responsive to or modify hormonal

the genomic region containing the promoter of TRIP6 was co-ordinately regulated as a function of pubertal development.\n In accordance, immunohistochemistry identified TRIP6 in adult, but not

recognized by the immune system of the mother, the immune response does not harm the fetus.\n Progesterone and a progesterone induced protein; PIBF are important players in re-adjusting the functioning of the maternal immune system during pregnancy.\n PIBF expressed by peripheral pregnancy lymphocytes, and other cell types, participates in the feto-maternal communication, partly, by mediating the immunological actions of progesterone.\n Several splice variants of PIBF were identified with different physiological activity.\n The full length 90 kD PIBF protein plays a role in cell cycle regulation, while shorter splice variants are secreted and act as cytokines.\n Aberrant production of PIBF isoforms lead to the loss of immune-regulatory functions, resulting in and pregnancy failure.\n By up regulating Th2 type cytokine production and by down-regulating NK activity, PIBF contributes to the altered attitude of the maternal immune system.\n Normal pregnancy is characterized by a Th2-dominant cytokine balance, which is partly due to the action of the smaller PIBF isoforms.\n These bind to a novel form of the IL-4 receptor, and induce increased production of IL-3, IL-4, and IL-10. The communication between the conceptus and the mother is established via extracellular vesicles (EVs).\n Pre-implantation embryos produce EVs both in vitro, and in vivo.\n PIBF transported by the EVs

Histone Methylation in human decidua","abstract":"id='Par1'>The process of implantation, trophoblast invasion and placentation demand continuous adaptation and modifications between the trophoblast (embryonic) and the decidua (maternal).\n Within the decidua, the maternal immune system undergoes continued changes, as the pregnancy progress, in terms of the cell population, phenotype and production of immune factors, cytokines and chemokines.\n Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is one of the earliest hormones produced by the blastocyst and has potent immune modulatory effects, especially in relation to T cells.\n We hypothesized that trophoblast-derived hCG modulates the immune population present at the maternal fetal interface by modifying the cytokine profile produced by the stromal/decidual cells.\n Using in vitro models from decidual samples we demonstrate that hCG inhibits CXCL10 expression by inducing H3K27me3 histone methylation, which binds to Region 4 of the CXCL10 promoter, thereby suppressing its expression.\n hCG-induced histone methylation is mediated through EZH2, a functional member of the PRC2 complex.\n Regulation of CXCL10 expression has a major impact on the capacity of endometrial stromal cells to recruit CD8 cells.\n We demonstrate the existence of a cross talk between the placenta (hCG) and the decidua (CXCL10) in the control of immune cell recruitment.\n Alterations in this immune regulatory function, such as during infection, will have detrimental effects on the success of the

0.05 versus controls).\n\n Compared with the control, recombinant human CCL2 was found to increase HEEC network formation (P &lt; 0.05) and neutralization of CCL2 in uNK conditioned media significantly decreased E2-dependent uNK-mediated network formation (P = 0.0006).\n\n\nLIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION\nOur results are based on in vitro responses of primary human cells and we cannot be certain that similar mechanisms occur in vivo in humans.\n\n Primary human uNK cells were isolated from first trimester decidua at a range of gestations (8–12 weeks), which may be a source of variation.\n\n Primary human uNK cells from non-pregnant endometrium were not assessed and therefore the responses of uNK cells to E2 treatment described in this study may be distinct to uNK cells from first trimester decidua.\n\n\nWIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS\nE2 is an essential regulator of reproductive competence.\n\n This study demonstrates a critical role for E2 in regulating cellular cross-talk within the endometrium during early pregnancy.\n\n We provide the first evidence that E2 directly regulates the function of human uNK cells by altering uNK cell migration and the secretion of uNK-derived angiogenic factors.\n\n We describe a novel mechanism of estrogen-dependent secretion of CCL2 which critically mediates uNK-dependent endometrial angiogenesis.\n\n Dysregulation of uNK cell function has been implicated in the aetiology of early implantation disorders and disorders of pregnancy.\n\n These novel findings provide unique insight into the regulation of uNK cell activity during the establishment of pregnancy in women and highlight key processes which may be targeted in future therapeutic strategies.\n\n\nSTUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S)\nStudies undertaken in the authors' laboratory were supported by MRC Programme Grant G1100356/1 to P.\n\nT.\n\nK.\n\nS.\n\n The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4498222","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"D.A.","surname":"Gibson","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"E.","surname":"Greaves","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"H.O.D.","surname":"Critchley","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"P.T.K.","surname":"Saunders","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.4049/jimmunol.171.1.37","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The uterine NK cell population requires IL-15 but these cells are not required for pregnancy nor the resolution of a Listeria monocytogenes infection","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1210/jcem.85.12.7023","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Progesterone Enhances Interleukin-15 Production in Human Endometrial Stromal Cells in Vitro1","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1007/s00281-007-0072-5","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The remission of rheumatoid arthritis during pregnancy","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJM199807303390501","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Rate of pregnancy-related relapse in multiple sclerosis.

effects of gonadal sex (testes or ovaries) and sex chromosomes (XX or XY).\n With this model, we produced gonadal male and female mice carrying XX or XY sex chromosome complements.\n Mice were gonadectomized to remove the acute effects of gonadal hormones and to uncover effects of sex chromosome complement on obesity.\n Mice with XX sex chromosomes (relative to XY), regardless of their type of gonad, had up to 2-fold increased adiposity and greater food intake during daylight hours, when mice are normally inactive.\n Mice with two X chromosomes also had accelerated weight gain on a high fat diet and developed fatty liver and elevated lipid and insulin levels.\n Further genetic studies with mice carrying XO and XXY chromosome complements revealed that the differences between XX and XY mice are attributable to dosage of the X chromosome, rather than effects of the Y chromosome.\n A subset of genes that escape X chromosome inactivation exhibited higher expression levels in adipose

disease 2019: retrospective study","abstract":"Objective\nTo delineate the clinical characteristics of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) who died.\n\n\nDesign\nRetrospective case series.\n\n\nSetting\nTongji Hospital in Wuhan, China.\n\n\nParticipants\nAmong a cohort of 799 patients, 113 who died and 161 who recovered with a diagnosis of covid-19 were analysed.\n\n Data were collected until 28 February 2020.\nMain outcome measures\nClinical characteristics and laboratory findings were obtained from electronic medical records with data collection forms.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of deceased patients (68 years) was significantly older than recovered patients (51 years).\n\n Male sex was more predominant in deceased patients (83; 73%) than in recovered patients (88; 55%).\n\n Chronic hypertension and other cardiovascular comorbidities were more frequent among deceased patients (54 (48%) and 16 (14%)) than recovered patients (39 (24%) and 7 (4%)).\n\n Dyspnoea, chest tightness, and disorder of consciousness were more common in deceased patients (70 (62%), 55 (49%), and 25 (22%)) than in recovered patients (50 (31%), 48 (30%), and 1 (1%)).\n\n The median time from disease onset to death in deceased patients was 16 (interquartile range 12.0-20.0) days.\n\n Leukocytosis was present in 56 (50%) patients who died and 6 (4%) who recovered, and lymphopenia was present in 103 (91%) and 76 (47%) respectively.\n\n Concentrations of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, creatinine, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, cardiac troponin I, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, and D-dimer were markedly higher in deceased patients than in recovered patients.\n\n Common complications observed more frequently in deceased patients included acute respiratory distress syndrome (113; 100%), type I respiratory failure (18/35; 51%), sepsis (113; 100%), acute cardiac injury (72/94; 77%), heart failure (41/83; 49%), alkalosis (14/35; 40%), hyperkalaemia (42; 37%), acute kidney injury (28; 25%), and hypoxic encephalopathy (23; 20%).\n\n Patients with cardiovascular comorbidity were more likely to develop cardiac complications.\n\n Regardless of history of cardiovascular disease, acute cardiac injury and heart failure were more common in deceased patients.\n\n\nConclusion\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection can cause both pulmonary and systemic inflammation, leading to multi-organ dysfunction in patients at high risk.\n\n Acute respiratory distress syndrome and respiratory failure, sepsis, acute cardiac injury, and heart failure were the most common critical complications during exacerbation of covid-19.\n","id":"PMC7190011","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Tao","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Di","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huilong","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Weiming","surname":"Yan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Danlei","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guang","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ke","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dong","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Haijing","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hongwu","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tao","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Guo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jia","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chen","surname":"Ding","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoping","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiaquan","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Meifang","surname":"Han","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shusheng","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoping","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jianping","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"

pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on

were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in

others.\n Subsequently, in what became known as the 20/80 rule, a small percentage of individuals within any population was observed to control most transmission events.\n This empirical rule was shown to govern inter-individual transmission dynamics for many pathogens in several species, and individuals who infect disproportionately more secondary contacts, as compared to most others, became known as super-spreaders.\n Studies conducted in the wake of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic revealed that, in the absence of super-spreading events, most individuals infect few, if any, secondary contacts.\n The analysis of SARS transmission, and reports from other outbreaks, unveil a complex scenario in which super-spreading events are shaped by multiple factors, including co-infection with another pathogen, immune suppression, changes in airflow dynamics, delayed hospital admission, misdiagnosis, and inter-hospital transfers.\n Predicting and identifying super-spreaders open significant medical and public health challenges, and represent important facets of infectious disease management and pandemic preparedness

unknown.\n Current evidence suggests that insectivorous bats are likely to be the original source, as several 2c CoVs have been described from various species in the family Vespertilionidae.\n Here, we describe a MERS-like CoV identified from a Pipistrellus cf.\n hesperidus bat sampled in Uganda (strain PREDICT/PDF-2180), further supporting the hypothesis that bats are the evolutionary source of MERS-CoV.\n Phylogenetic analysis showed that PREDICT/PDF-2180 is closely related to MERS-CoV across much of its genome, consistent with a common ancestry; however, the spike protein was highly divergent (46% amino acid identity), suggesting that the two viruses may have different receptor binding properties.\n Indeed, several amino acid substitutions were identified in key binding residues that were predicted to block PREDICT/PDF-2180 from attaching to the MERS-CoV DPP4 receptor.\n To experimentally test this hypothesis, an infectious MERS-CoV clone expressing the PREDICT/PDF-2180 spike protein was generated.\n Recombinant viruses derived from the clone were replication competent but unable to spread and establish new infections in Vero cells or primary human airway epithelial cells.\n Our findings suggest that PREDICT/PDF-2180 is unlikely to pose a zoonotic threat.\n Recombination in the S1 subunit of the spike gene was identified as the primary mechanism driving variation

SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) replication in the respiratory tract and are available in sufficient numbers for statistical evaluation.\n They are relatively inexpensive and easily accessible, but their use in SARS research is limited because they do not develop illness following infection.\n Older (12- to 14-mo-old) BALB/c mice develop clinical illness and pneumonitis, but they can be hard to procure, and immune senescence complicates pathogenesis studies.\n We adapted the SARS-CoV (Urbani strain) by serial passage in the respiratory tract of young BALB/c mice.\n Fifteen passages resulted in a virus (MA15) that is lethal for mice following intranasal inoculation.\n Lethality is preceded by rapid and high titer viral replication in lungs, viremia, and dissemination of virus to extrapulmonary sites accompanied by lymphopenia, neutrophilia, and pathological changes in the lungs.\n Abundant viral antigen is extensively distributed in bronchial epithelial cells and alveolar pneumocytes, and necrotic cellular debris is present in airways and alveoli, with only mild and focal pneumonitis.\n These observations suggest that mice infected with MA15 die from an overwhelming viral infection with extensive, virally mediated destruction of pneumocytes and ciliated epithelial cells.\n The MA15 virus has six coding mutations associated with adaptation and increased virulence; when introduced into a recombinant SARS-CoV, these mutations result in a highly virulent and lethal virus (rMA15), duplicating the phenotype of the biologically derived MA15 virus.\n Intranasal inoculation with MA15 reproduces many aspects of disease seen in severe human cases of SARS.\n The availability of the MA15 virus will enhance the use of the mouse model for SARS because infection with MA15 causes morbidity, mortality, and pulmonary pathology.\n This virus will be of value as a stringent challenge in evaluation of the efficacy of vaccines and

MERS-CoVs, precluding an investigation of intrapatient heterogeneity.\n Here, we analyzed non–consensus sequences to characterize intrapatient heterogeneity in cases associated with the 2015 outbreak of MERS in South Korea.\n Deep-sequencing analysis of MERS-CoV genomes performed on specimens from eight patients revealed significant intrapatient variation; therefore, sequence heterogeneity was further analyzed using targeted deep sequencing.\n A total of 35 specimens from 24 patients (including a super-spreader) were sequenced to detect and analyze variants displaying intrapatient heterogeneity.\n Based on the analysis of non–consensus sequences, we demonstrated the intrapatient heterogeneity of MERS-CoVs, with the highest level in the super-spreader specimen.\n The heterogeneity could be transmitted in a close association with variation in the consensus sequences, suggesting the occurrence of multiple MERS-CoV infections.\n Analysis of intrapatient heterogeneity revealed a relationship between D510G and I529T mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike glycoprotein.\n These two mutations have been reported to reduce the affinity of the RBD for human CD26. Notably, although the frequency of both D510G and I529T varied greatly among specimens, the combined frequency of the single mutants was consistently high (87.7% ± 1.9% on average).\n Concurrently, the frequency of occurrence of the wild type at the two positions was only 6.5% ± 1.7% on average, supporting the hypothesis that selection pressure exerted by the host immune response played a critical role in shaping genetic variants and their interaction in human MERS-CoVs during the outbreak.\n","id":"PMC5111008","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Donghyun","surname":"Park","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hee Jae","surname":"Huh","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yeon Jeong","surname":"Kim","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Yeon Jeong","surname":"Kim","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dae-Soon","surname":"Son","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Dae-Soon","surname":"Son","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hyo-Jeong","surname":"Jeon","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Eu-Hyun","surname":"Im","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jong-Won","surname":"Kim","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nam Yong","surname":"Lee","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Eun-Suk","surname":"Kang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Cheol In","surname":"Kang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Doo Ryeon","surname":"Chung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jin-Hyun","surname":"Ahn","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kyong Ran","surname":"Peck","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sun Shim","surname":"Choi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yae-Jean","surname":"Kim","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chang-Seok","surname":"Ki","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Woong-Yang","surname":"Park","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2001316","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Early Transmission Dynamics in Wuhan, China, of Novel Coronavirus–Infected Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nThe initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data.\n\n Outcomes were followed up until Jan 25, 2020.\nFindings\nOf the 99 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, 49 (49%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market.\n\n The average age of the patients was 55·5 years (SD 13·1), including 67 men and 32 women.\n\n 2019-nCoV was detected in all patients by real-time RT-PCR.\n\n 50 (51%) patients had chronic diseases.\n\n Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (82 [83%] patients),

rhinorrhoea (four [4%] patients), chest pain (two [2%] patients), diarrhoea (two [2%] patients), and nausea and vomiting (one [1%] patient).\n\n According to imaging examination, 74 (75%) patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 14 (14%) patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity, and one (1%) patient had pneumothorax.\n\n 17 (17%) patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and, among them, 11 (11%) patients worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection was of clustering onset, is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n In general, characteristics of patients who died were in line with the MuLBSTA score, an early warning model for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia.\n\n Further investigation is needed to explore the applicability of the MuLBSTA score in

the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with

Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China5.\n This outbreak highlights the ongoing ability of viral spill-over from animals to cause severe disease in humans.\n","id":"PMC7094943","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Fan","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Su","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yan-Mei","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wen","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhi-Gang","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Wu","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Wu","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jun-Hua","surname":"Tian","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan-Yuan","surname":"Pei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ming-Li","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yu-Ling","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fa-Hui","surname":"Dai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi-Min","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiao-Jiao","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Edward C.","surname":"Holmes","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong-Zhen","surname":"Zhang","email":"zhangyongzhen@shphc.org.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong-Zhen","surname":"Zhang","email":"zhangyongzhen@shphc.org.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The clinical pathology of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS): a report from China","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinicopathologic, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural findings of a fatal case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection in the United Arab Emirates, April 2014","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]}]},{"doi":"10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30129-8","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Can we contain the COVID-19 outbreak with the same measures as for SARS?","abstract":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 resulted in more than 8000 cases and 800 deaths.\n SARS was eventually contained by means of syndromic surveillance, prompt isolation of patients, strict enforcement of quarantine of all contacts, and in some areas top-down enforcement of community quarantine.\n By interrupting all human-to-human transmission, SARS was effectively eradicated.\n By contrast, by Feb 28, 2020, within a matter of 2 months since the beginning of the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), more than 82?000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported with more than 2800 deaths.\n Although there are striking similarities between SARS and COVID-19, the differences in the virus characteristics will ultimately determine whether the same measures for SARS will also be successful for COVID-19.

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

outbreak on the Diamond Princess cruise ship: estimating the epidemic potential and effectiveness of public health countermeasures","abstract":"Background\nCruise ships carry a large number of people in confined spaces with relative homogeneous mixing.\n\n On 3 February, 2020, an outbreak of COVID-19 on cruise ship Diamond Princess was reported with 10 initial cases, following an index case on board around 21-25th January.\n\n By 4th February, public health measures such as removal and isolation of ill passengers and quarantine of non-ill passengers were implemented.\n\n By 20th February, 619 of 3700 passengers and crew (17%) were tested positive.\n\n\nMethods\nWe estimated the basic reproduction number from the initial period of the outbreak using SEIR models.\n\n We calibrated the models with transient functions of countermeasures to incidence data.\n\n We additionally estimated a counterfactual scenario in absence of countermeasures, and established a model stratified by crew and guests to study the impact of differential contact rates among the groups.\n\n We also compared scenarios of an earlier versus later evacuation of the ship.\n\n\nResults\nThe basic reproduction rate was initially 4 times higher on-board compared to the \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\usepackage{amsmath}\n\usepackage{wasysym} \n\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\usepackage{amssymb}

lowered it substantially.\n\n Based on the modeled initial \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\usepackage{amsmath}\n\usepackage{wasysym} \n\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\usepackage{amssymb} \n\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\usepackage{upgreek}\n\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\begin{document}\n}{}${R}_0$\end{document} of 14.8, we estimated that without any interventions within the time period of 21 January to 19 February, 2920 out of the 3700 (79%) would have been infected.\n\n Isolation and quarantine therefore prevented 2307 cases, and lowered the

We showed that an early evacuation of all passengers on 3 February would have been associated with 76 infected persons in their incubation time.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe cruise ship conditions clearly amplified an already highly transmissible disease.\n\n The public health measures prevented more than 2000 additional cases compared to no interventions.\n\n However, evacuating all passengers and crew early on in the outbreak would have prevented many more passengers and crew from infection.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7107563","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"J","surname":"Rocklöv","email":"joacim.rocklov@envmed.umu.se","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"H","surname":"Sjödin","email":"henrik.sjodin@umu.se","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"A","surname":"Wilder-Smith","email":"annelies.wilder-smith@lshtm.ac.uk","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The Epidemiological Characteristics of an Outbreak of 2019 Novel Coronavirus Diseases (COVID-19):China, 2020.

Vis-À-Vis Onset of Fever","abstract":"Study objectives:\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a rapidly progressive disease caused by a novel coronavirus (CoV) infection.\n\n However, the disease presentation is nonspecific.\n\n The aim of this study was to define clearly the presentation, clinical progression, and laboratory data in a group of patients who had SARS.\n\n\nDesign:\nRetrospective observational study.\n\n\nSetting:\nA tertiary care medical center with 51 negative-pressure isolation rooms in Taipei, Taiwan.\n\n\nPatients:\nFifty-three patients with SARS seen between April 27 and June 16, 2003.\nResults:\nFever (ie, temperature &gt; 38°C) was the most common symptom (98%) and the earliest.\n\n When admitted to the isolation unit of the hospital for observation, most patients reported nonspecific symptoms associated with their fever.\n\n Only two patients with preexisting illnesses had cough on the same day the fever began.\n\n Eventually, 39 patients (74%) developed cough, beginning at a mean (± SD) time of 4.5 ± 1.9 days after fever onset, and 35 patients (66%) had diarrhea beginning at a mean time of 6.0 ± 3.3 days after fever onset.\n\n Thirty-one patients (59%) had abnormal findings on chest radiographs on hospital admission, and all but 1 patient (98%) eventually developed lung infiltrates that were consistent with pneumonia.\n\n The majority of patients (63%) first developed unifocal infiltrates at a mean time of 4.5 ± 2.1 days after fever onset, while in 37% of patients the initial infiltrates were multifocal, appearing at a mean time of 5.8 ± 1.3 days after fever onset.\n\n Common laboratory findings included lymphopenia (on hospital admission, 70%; during hospitalization, 95%), thrombocytopenia (on hospital admission, 28%; during hospitalization, 40%), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (on hospital admission, 58%; during hospitalization, 88%), creatine kinase (on hospital admission, 18%; during hospitalization, 32%), and aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase levels (on hospital admission, 27%; during hospitalization, 62%).\n\n Throat or nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and real-time PCR was positive in 40 of the 47 patients (85%) in whom the test was performed.\n\n\nConclusions:\nNone of the presenting symptoms or laboratory findings are pathognomonic for SARS.\n\n Even though cough developed in a majority of patients, it did not occur until later in the disease course, suggesting that a cough preceding or concurrent with the onset of fever is less likely to indicate SARS.\n\n While PCR for SARS-CoV appears to be the best early diagnostic test currently available, it is clear that better methods are needed to differentiate between SARS and non-SARS illness on initial presentation.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7094461","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ching-Lung","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yen-Ta","surname":"Lu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Meng-Jen","surname":"Peng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pei-Jan","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rong-Luh","surname":"Lin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chien-Liang","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hsu-Tah","surname":"Kuo","email":"kuohsu@ms2.mmh.org.tw","contributions":"1"}],"References
