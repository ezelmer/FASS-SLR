The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days

associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included

associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

The combination of eosinopenia and elevated hs-CRP yielded a sensitivity of 67·9% and specificity of 78·2% (AUC=0·730).\n\n The addition of eosinopenia alone or the combination of eosinopenia and elevated hs-CRP into the guideline-recommended diagnostic parameters for COVID-19 improved the predictive capacity with higher than zero of both net reclassification improvement (NRI) and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI).\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe combination of eosinopenia and elevated hs-CRP can effectively triage suspected COVID-19 patients from other patients attending the fever clinic with COVID-19-like initial symptoms.\n\n This finding would be particularly useful for designing triage strategies in an epidemic region having a large number of patients with COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases while limited medical resources for nucleic acid tests and radiographic examination.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7196382","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Qilin","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiuli","surname":"Ding","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Geqing","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Heng-Gui","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fenghua","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhi","surname":"Geng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Luming","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shijun","surname":"Lei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"An","surname":"Pan","email":"panan@hust.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin","surname":"Wang","email":"lin_wang@hust.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng","surname":"Wang","email":"zhengwang@hust.edu.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1001/jamacardio.2020.0950","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Association of cardiac injury with mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1001/jamacardio.2020.1017","date":"2020-03-09","title":"Cardiovascular Implications of Fatal Outcomes of Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)","abstract":"This case series study evaluates the association of underlying cardiovascular disease and myocardial injury on fatal outcomes in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n","id":"PMC7101506","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Tao","surname":"Guo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yongzhen","surname":"Fan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ming","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoyan","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tao","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hairong","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Wan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xinghuan","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhibing","surname":"Lu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30566-3","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study","abstract":"Background\nSince December, 2019, Wuhan, China, has experienced an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).\n\n Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (?18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020.

Serological Study for the Prevalence of Anti-MERS Coronavirus Antibodies in High- and Low-Risk Groups in Qatar","abstract":"Infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) could be asymptomatic or cause mild influenza-like illness.\n Therefore, the prevalence of MERS-CoV infections in the general population could be underestimated, which necessitates active surveillance to determine the epidemiological importance of asymptomatic cases.\n The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of various serological assays and to estimate the seroprevalence of anti-MERS-CoV antibodies in high- and low-risk groups in Qatar.\n A total of 4858 samples were screened, including 4719 samples collected from healthy blood donors (BD) over a period of five years (2012-2016), 135 samples from baseline case contacts (CC) collected from individuals in close contact with three positive PCR-confirmed patients (CP), and four samples from MERS-CoV CP.\n Initial screening using anti-MERS-CoV IgG (IgG rS1-ELISA kit) revealed ten reactive samples from BD (10/4719, 0.21%), one from CC (1/135, 0.74%), and three from CP (3/4, 75%).\n Samples from CP but not from BD were also reactive by whole-virus anti-MERS-CoV IgG (n = 3/4) and IgM (n = 1/4) indirect immunefluorescent tests (IIFT) and pseudoparticle neutralization test (ppNT).\n The reactive sample from CC was also confirmed by ppNT.\n Surprisingly, one out of thirteen (7.7%) randomly selected IgG rS1-ELISA-negative BD samples from the initial screening was reactive by the IgM-IIFT (but not by the IgG-IIFT) and was subsequently confirmed by ppNT.\n All IgG rS1-ELISA-reactive samples from BD exhibited considerable reactivity to the four circulating human coronaviruses (HKU1, OC43, 229E, and NL63).\n Cross-reactivity with SARS was only reported for samples from CP using IgG and IgM-IIFT.\n In conclusion, we report a low prevalence of anti-MERS antibodies in the general population, which coincides with the low number of all reported cases by the time of our study (2017) in Qatar (n = 21).\n The false-positive results and the observed cross-reactivity between MERS-CoV and other circulating human coronavirus necessitate more detailed evaluation of available serological assays.\n","id":"PMC6398027","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Reham

coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7159299","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Chaolin","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yeming","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xingwang","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lili","surname":"Ren","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jianping","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Li","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guohui","surname":"Fan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiuyang","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoying","surname":"Gu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhenshun","surname":"Cheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiaan","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wenjuan","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuelei","surname":"Xie","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wen","surname":"Yin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Min","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yan","surname":"Xiao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Li","surname":"Guo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jungang","surname":"Xie","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guangfa","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rongmeng","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhancheng","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Jin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jianwei","surname":"Wang","email":"wangjw28@163.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Cao","email":"caobin_ben@163.com","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical

of small cytokines and generally have low molecular weight ranging from 7 to 15kDa.\n Chemokines and their receptors are able to control the migration and residence of all immune cells.\n Some chemokines are considered pro-inflammatory, and their release can be induced during an immune response at a site of infection, while others are considered homeostatic and are involved in controlling of cells migration during tissue development or maintenance.\n The physiologic importance of this family of mediators is resulting from their specificity ? members of the chemokine family induce recruitment of well-defined leukocyte subsets.\n There are two major chemokine sub-families based upon cysteine residues position: CXC and CC.\n As a general rule, members of the CXC chemokines are chemotactic for neutrophils, and CC chemokines are chemotactic for monocytes and sub-set of lymphocytes, although there are some exceptions.\n This review discusses the potential role of chemokines in inflammation focusing on the two best-characterized chemokines: monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, a CC chemokine, and interleukin-8, a member of the CXC chemokine

We report detailed clinical and virological data for two related cases of MERS-CoV disease, after nosocomial transmission of the virus from one patient to another in a French hospital.\n\n\nMethods\nPatient 1 visited Dubai in April, 2013; patient 2 lives in France and did not travel abroad.\n\n Both patients had underlying immunosuppressive disorders.\n\n We tested specimens from the upper (nasopharyngeal swabs) or the lower (bronchoalveolar lavage, sputum) respiratory tract and whole blood, plasma, and serum specimens for MERS-CoV by real-time RT-PCR targeting the upE and Orf1A genes of MERS-CoV.\n\n\nFindings\nInitial clinical presentation included fever, chills, and myalgia in both patients, and for patient 1, diarrhoea.\n\n Respiratory symptoms rapidly became predominant with acute respiratory failure leading to mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).\n\n Both patients developed acute renal failure.\n\n MERS-CoV was detected in lower respiratory tract specimens with high viral load (eg, cycle threshold [Ct] values of 22·9 for upE and 24 for Orf1a for a bronchoalveolar lavage sample from patient 1; Ct values of 22·5 for upE and 23·9 for Orf1a for an induced sputum sample from patient 2), whereas nasopharyngeal specimens were weakly positive or inconclusive.\n\n The two patients shared the same room for 3 days.\n\n The incubation period was estimated at 9–12 days for the second case.\n\n No secondary transmission was documented in hospital staff despite the absence of specific protective measures before the diagnosis of MERS-CoV was suspected.\n\n Patient 1 died on May 28, due to refractory multiple organ failure.\n\n\nInterpretation\nPatients with respiratory symptoms returning from the Middle East or exposed to a confirmed case should be isolated and investigated for MERS-CoV with lower respiratory tract sample analysis and an assumed incubation period of 12 days.\n\n

host cells","abstract":"id='Par1'>In face of the everlasting battle toward COVID-19 and the rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2, no specific and effective drugs for treating this disease have been reported until today.\n Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a receptor of SARS-CoV-2, mediates the virus infection by binding to spike protein.\n Although ACE2 is expressed in the lung, kidney, and intestine, its expressing levels are rather low, especially in the lung.\n Considering the great infectivity of COVID-19, we speculate that SARS-CoV-2 may depend on other routes to facilitate its infection.\n Here, we first discover an interaction between host cell receptor CD147 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.\n The loss of CD147 or blocking CD147 in Vero E6 and BEAS-2B cell lines by anti-CD147 antibody, Meplazumab, inhibits SARS-CoV-2 amplification.\n Expression of human CD147 allows virus entry into non-susceptible BHK-21 cells, which can be neutralized by CD147 extracellular fragment.\n Viral loads are detectable in the lungs of human CD147 (hCD147) mice infected with SARS-CoV-2, but not in those of virus-infected wild type mice.\n Interestingly, virions are observed in lymphocytes of lung tissue from a COVID-19 patient.\n Human T cells with a property of ACE2 natural deficiency can be infected with SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus in a dose-dependent manner, which is specifically inhibited by Meplazumab.\n Furthermore, CD147 mediates virus entering host cells by endocytosis.\n Together, our study reveals a novel virus entry route, CD147-spike protein, which provides an important target for developing specific and effective drug against COVID-19.","id":"PMC7714896","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ke","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zheng","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yongqiang","surname":"Deng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jian-Qi","surname":"Lian","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Du","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ding","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiu-Xuan","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Li","surname":"Gong","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xu","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhiwei","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jie-Jie","surname":"Geng","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Jie-Jie","surname":"Geng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ruo","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hai","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yu-Meng","surname":"Zhu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gang","surname":"Nan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jian-Li","surname":"Jiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ling","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jiao","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Lin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wan","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Liangzhi","surname":"Xie","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhao-Hui","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kui","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jin-Lin","surname":"Miao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hong-Yong","surname":"Cui","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Min","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jun","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ling","surname":"Fu","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Ling","surname":"Fu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiang-Min","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhongpeng","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shihui","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hongjing","surname":"Gu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhe","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chun-Fu","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yacheng","surname":"Lu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ying-Ying","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Qing-Yi","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Huijie","surname":"Bian","email":"hjbian@fmmu.edu.cn","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ping","surname":"Zhu","email":"zhuping@fmmu.edu.cn","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhi-Nan","surname":"Chen","email":"znchen@fmmu.edu.cn","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.sjbs.2019.03.006","date":"2019-03-19","title":"Chemokines

we examined sex differences in viral loads, SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody titers, plasma cytokines, as well as blood cell phenotyping in COVID-19 patients.\n By focusing our analysis on patients with moderate disease who had not received immunomodulatory medications, our results revealed that male patients had higher plasma levels of innate immune cytokines such as IL-8 and IL-18 along with more robust induction of non-classical monocytes.\n In contrast, female patients mounted significantly more robust T cell activation than male patients during SARS-CoV-2 infection, which was sustained in old age.\n Importantly, we found that a poor T cell response negatively correlated with patients’ age and was associated with worse disease outcome in male patients, but not in female patients.\n Conversely, higher innate immune cytokines in female patients associated with worse disease progression, but not in male patients.\n These findings reveal a possible explanation underlying observed

infection among pediatric patients reporting diarrhea and influenza-like illness","abstract":"Background\nInfluenza is a major cause of morbidity and hospitalization among children.\n\n While less often reported in adults, gastrointestinal symptoms have been associated with influenza in children, including abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.\n\n\nMethods\nFrom September 2005 and April 2008, pediatric patients in Indonesia presenting with concurrent diarrhea and influenza-like illness were enrolled in a study to determine the frequency of influenza virus infection in young patients presenting with symptoms less commonly associated with an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI).\n\n Stool specimens and upper respiratory swabs were assayed for the presence of influenza virus.\n\n\nResults\nSeasonal influenza A or influenza B viral RNA was detected in 85 (11.6%) upper respiratory specimens and 21 (2.9%) of stool specimens.\n\n Viable influenza B virus was isolated from the stool specimen of one case.\n\n During the time of this study, human infections with highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) virus were common in the survey area.\n\n However, among 733 enrolled subjects, none had evidence of H5N1 virus infection.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe detection of influenza viral RNA and viable influenza virus from stool suggests that influenza virus may be localized in the gastrointestinal tract of children, may be associated with pediatric diarrhea and may serve as a potential mode of transmission during seasonal and epidemic influenza outbreaks.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2820480","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Charisma","surname":"Dilantika","email":"dila@namrutwo.org","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Endang

was to determine the viral load in different body sites.\n Viral loads of pandemic H1N1 virus in respiratory specimens, stool, urine, and serum were determined by quantitative reverse transcriptase?polymerase chain reaction (RT?PCR).\n Respiratory specimens from patients with seasonal influenza were used as historical controls.\n Initial pre?treatment viral load were compared between these two groups.\n Serial respiratory specimens from patients with pandemic H1N1 virus infection were obtained for analysis of viral dynamics.\n Twenty?two pandemic H1N1 cases and 44 seasonal influenza historical controls were included.\n The mean initial viral load before oseltamivir therapy was 1.84?×?108?copies/ml for pandemic H1N1 virus compared with 3.28?×?108?copies/ml in seasonal influenza historical controls (P?=?0.085).\n Among patients with pandemic H1N1 virus infection, peak viral load occurred on the day of onset of symptoms, and declined gradually afterwards, with no virus being detectable in respiratory specimens by RT?PCR 8 days and by culture 5 days after the onset of symptoms respectively, except in one patient.\n Pandemic H1N1 virus was detected in stool and in urine from 4/9 and 1/14 patients, respectively.\n Viral culture was also positive from the stool sample with the highest viral load.\n Younger age was associated with prolonged shedding in the respiratory tract and higher viral load in the stool.\n Data from this quantitative analysis of viral shedding may have implications for formulating infection control measures.\n J.\n Med.\n Virol.\n

Stool specimens were collected and tested for influenza viruses A (seasonal A/H3N2 and pandemic A/H1N1) and B, and for four enteric viruses (astrovirus, group A rotavirus, human enteric adenovirus, norovirus of genogroups I – NoVGI - and genogroup II - NoVGII).\n\n\nResults\nGeneral practitioners enrolled 138 cases and 93 controls.\n\n Of the 138 stool specimens collected, 92 (66.7%) were positive for at least one of the four enteric viruses analysed and 10 (7.2%) tested positive for one influenza virus.\n\n None of these 10 influenza positive patients reported respiratory symptoms.\n\n In five influenza-positive patients (3.6%), we also detected one enteric virus, with 4 of them being positive for influenza B (2 had co-detection with NoVGI, 1 with NoVGII, and 1 with astrovirus).\n\n None of the 93 controls tested positive for one of the enteric and/or other influenza viruses we investigated.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn this study we showed that the simultaneous detection of influenza and enteric viruses is not a rare event.\n\n We have also reported, for the first time in general practice, the presence of seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses in the stools of adult patients consulting for uncomplicated AD.\n\n A simultaneous investigation of enteric and influenza viruses in patients complaining of gastrointestinal symptoms could be useful for future studies to better identify the agents responsible for AD.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3466123","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Christophe","surname":"Arena","email":"arena@u707.jussieu.fr","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jean Pierre","surname":"Amoros","email":"jean-pierre.amoros@ch-ajaccio.fr","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Véronique","surname":"Vaillant","email":"v.vaillant@invs.sante.fr","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Katia","surname":"Balay","email":"katia.balay@chu-dijon.fr","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Roxane","surname":"Chikhi-Brachet","email":"roxane.brachet@anrs.fr","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Laurent","surname":"Varesi","email":"varesi@univ-corse.fr","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jean","surname":"Arrighi","email":"jeanarrighi@orange.fr","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Thierry","surname":"Blanchon","email":"blanchon@u707.jussieu.fr","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Fabrice","surname":"Carrat","email":"carrat@u707.jussieu.fr","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Thomas","surname":"Hanslik","email":"hanslik@u707.jussieu.fr","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alessandra","surname":"Falchi","email":"falchi@u707.jussieu.fr","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1073/pnas.80.11.3153","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Hemolytic activity of influenza virus hemagglutinin glycoproteins activated in mildly acidic environments","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.3201/eid1607.091248","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Long-term Shedding of Influenza A Virus in Stool of Immunocompromised Child","abstract":"In immunocompromised patients, influenza infection may progress to prolonged viral shedding from the respiratory tract despite antiviral therapy.\n We describe chronic influenza A virus infection in an immunocompromised child who had prolonged shedding of culturable influenza virus in stool.\n","id":"PMC3321893","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Benjamin A.","surname":"Pinsky","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Samantha","surname":"Mix","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Judy","surname":"Rowe","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sheryl","surname":"Ikemoto","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ellen J.","surname":"Baron","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1007/s005350050062","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Detection of genes of RNA viruses from freshly biopsied gastric mucosa by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1128/JVI.01544-13","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Fecal influenza in mammals: selection of novel variants","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Receptor binding and pH stability - how influenza A virus hemagglutinin affects host-specific virus infection","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1111/j.1750-2659.2012.00402.x","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Intestinal binding of seasonal influenza A viruses to DC?SIGN<sup>+</sup> CD68<sup>+</sup> cells","abstract":"","id":"PMC5779836","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Martin C.

glycoreceptors expression, in particular CEACAM6, typically found in ileal Crohn's disease (CD), favor, among the commensal species of microbiota, the enrichment in Escherichia coli.\n Removal of protein glycosidic residues by neuraminidase, a sialidase typical of influenza virus, increases adhesion ability of Escherichia coli to Caco-2 intestinal cells.\n In this study we investigated whether influenza virus infection of human intestinal epithelial cells could influence the adhesiveness of different Escherichia coli strains isolated from CD patients by altering surface glycoreceptors.\n Influenza virus infection of intestinal cells increased exposure of galactose and mannose residues on the cell surface.\n In particular, glycoreceptors Thomsen-Friedenreich and CEACAM6 were over-expressed in influenza virus infected cells.\n In the same experimental conditions, a significant increase in bacterial adhesiveness was observed, independently of their own adhesive ability.\n The increase was reverted by treatment with anti-TF and anti-CEACAM6 antibodies.\n Interestingly, influenza virus was able to efficiently replicate in human primary intestinal cells leading to TF exposure.\n Finally, intestinal infected cells produced high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines compared to control.\n Overall these data suggest that influenza virus infection, could constitute an additional risk factor in CD

outbreak, such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Toronto in 2003, amplifies the difficulties of hospital priority setting.\n\n The purpose of this study is to describe and evaluate priority setting in a hospital in response to SARS using the ethical framework 'accountability for reasonableness'.\n\n\nMethods\nThis study was conducted at a large tertiary hospital in Toronto, Canada.\n\n There were two data sources: 1) over 200 key documents (e.\n\ng.\n\n emails, bulletins), and 2) 35 interviews with key informants.\n\n Analysis used a modified thematic technique in three phases: open coding, axial coding, and evaluation.\n\n\nResults\nParticipants described the types of priority setting decisions, the decision making process and the reasoning used.\n\n Although the hospital leadership made an effort to meet the conditions of 'accountability for reasonableness', they acknowledged that the decision making was not ideal.\n\n We described good practices and opportunities for improvement.\n\n\nConclusions\n'Accountability for reasonableness' is a framework that can be used to guide fair priority setting in health care organizations, such as hospitals.\n\n In the midst of a crisis such as SARS where guidance is incomplete, consequences uncertain, and information constantly changing, where hour-by-hour decisions involve life and death, fairness is more

rate.\n\n Currently, there is no specific therapy or vaccine with proven effectiveness for MERS-CoV infections.\n\n\nMethods\nA combination of ribavirin and interferon therapy was used for the treatment of five MERS-CoV-positive patients.\n\n We reviewed the therapeutic schedule and the outcome of these patients.\n\n\nResults\nAll patients were critically ill with acute respiratory distress syndrome treated with adjunctive corticosteroids and were on mechanical ventilation at the time of initiation of therapy.\n\n The median time from admission to therapy with ribavirin and interferon was 19 (range 10–22) days.\n\n None of the patients responded to the supportive or therapeutic interventions and all died of their illness.\n\n\nConclusions\nWhile ribavirin and interferon may be effective in some patients, our practical experience suggests that critically ill patients with multiple comorbidities who are diagnosed late in the course of their illness may not benefit from combination antiviral therapy as preclinical data suggest.\n\n There is clearly an urgent need for a novel effective antiviral therapy for this emerging global

the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing Municipal Science and Technology

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.\n\n Increasing quartile of NLR was statistically significantly associated with secondary outcome.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR is associated with outcomes in unselected critically ill patients.\n\n In patients with sepsis, there was no statistically significant relationship between NLR and mortality.\n\n Further investigation is required to increase understanding of the pathophysiology of this relationship and to validate these findings with data collected prospectively.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article

recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like

cells: pluripotency and self-renewal.\n\n Current efforts focus on identifying genes that play important roles in maintaining pluripotency and self-renewal in ES cells and aim to understand the interactions among these genes.\n\n To that end, we investigated the use of unsigned and signed network analysis to identify pluripotency and differentiation related genes.\n\n\nResults\nWe show that signed networks provide a better systems level understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of ES cells than unsigned networks, using two independent murine ES cell expression data sets.\n\n Specifically, using signed weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), we found a pluripotency module and a differentiation module, which are not identified in unsigned networks.\n\n We confirmed the importance of these modules by incorporating genome-wide TF binding data for key ES cell regulators.\n\n Interestingly, we find that the pluripotency module is enriched with genes related to DNA damage repair and mitochondrial function in addition to transcriptional regulation.\n\n Using a connectivity measure of module membership, we not only identify known regulators of ES cells but also show that Mrpl15, Msh6, Nrf1, Nup133, Ppif, Rbpj, Sh3gl2, and Zfp39, among other genes, have important roles in maintaining ES cell pluripotency and self-renewal.\n\n We also report highly significant relationships between module membership and epigenetic modifications (histone modifications and promoter CpG methylation status), which are known to play a role in controlling gene expression during ES cell self-renewal and differentiation.\n\n\nConclusion\nOur systems biologic re-analysis of gene expression, transcription factor binding, epigenetic and gene ontology data

replication in the respiratory tract and are available in sufficient numbers for statistical evaluation.\n They are relatively inexpensive and easily accessible, but their use in SARS research is limited because they do not develop illness following infection.\n Older (12- to 14-mo-old) BALB/c mice develop clinical illness and pneumonitis, but they can be hard to procure, and immune senescence complicates pathogenesis studies.\n We adapted the SARS-CoV (Urbani strain) by serial passage in the respiratory tract of young BALB/c mice.\n Fifteen passages resulted in a virus (MA15) that is lethal for mice following intranasal inoculation.\n Lethality is preceded by rapid and high titer viral replication in lungs, viremia, and dissemination of virus to extrapulmonary sites accompanied by lymphopenia, neutrophilia, and pathological changes in the lungs.\n Abundant viral antigen is extensively distributed in bronchial epithelial cells and alveolar pneumocytes, and necrotic cellular debris is present in airways and alveoli, with only mild and focal pneumonitis.\n These observations suggest that mice infected with MA15 die from an overwhelming viral infection with extensive, virally mediated destruction of pneumocytes and ciliated epithelial cells.\n The MA15 virus has six coding mutations associated with adaptation and increased virulence; when introduced into a recombinant SARS-CoV, these mutations result in a highly virulent and lethal virus (rMA15), duplicating the phenotype of the biologically derived MA15 virus.\n Intranasal inoculation with MA15 reproduces many aspects of disease seen in severe human cases of SARS.\n The availability of the MA15 virus will enhance the use of the mouse model for SARS because infection with MA15 causes morbidity, mortality, and pulmonary pathology.\n This virus will be of value as a stringent challenge in evaluation of the efficacy of vaccines and

In contrast to most models of viral pathogenesis, infection of type I, type II or type III interferon knockout mice (129 background) with either Urbani or MA15 viruses resulted in clinical disease outcomes, including transient weight loss, denuding bronchiolitis and alveolar inflammation and recovery, identical to that seen in infection of wildtype mice.\n This suggests that type I, II and III interferon signaling play minor roles in regulating SARS pathogenesis in mouse models.\n In contrast, infection of STAT1?/? mice resulted in severe disease, high virus titer, extensive pulmonary lesions and 100% mortality by day 9 and 30 post-infection with rMA15 or Urbani viruses, respectively.\n Non-lethal in BALB/c mice, Urbani SARS-CoV infection in STAT1?/? mice caused disseminated infection involving the liver, spleen and other tissues after day 9. These findings demonstrated that SARS-CoV pathogenesis is regulated by a STAT1 dependent but type I, II and III interferon receptor independent, mechanism.\n In contrast to a well documented role in innate immunity, we propose that STAT1 also protects mice via its role as an antagonist of unrestrained cell proliferation.\n","id":"PMC2851658","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Matthew

Is Required for Protection from Lethal Infection with a Mouse-Adapted SARS-CoV","abstract":"A novel human coronavirus, SARS-CoV, emerged suddenly in 2003, causing approximately 8000 human cases and more than 700 deaths worldwide.\n Since most animal models fail to faithfully recapitulate the clinical course of SARS-CoV in humans, the virus and host factors that mediate disease pathogenesis remain unclear.\n Recently, our laboratory and others developed a recombinant mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (rMA15) that was lethal in BALB/c mice.\n In contrast, intranasal infection of young 10-week-old C57BL/6 mice with rMA15 results in a nonlethal infection characterized by high titer replication within the lungs, lung inflammation, destruction of lung tissue, and loss of body weight, thus providing a useful model to identify host mediators of protection.\n Here, we report that mice deficient in MyD88 (MyD88?/?), an adapter protein that mediates Toll-like receptor (TLR), IL-1R, and IL-18R signaling, are far more susceptible to rMA15 infection.\n The genetic absence of MyD88 resulted in enhanced pulmonary pathology and greater than 90% mortality by day 6 post-infection.\n MyD88?/? mice had significantly higher viral loads in lung tissue throughout the course of infection.\n Despite increased viral loads, the expression of multiple proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines within lung tissue and recruitment of inflammatory monocytes/macrophages to the lung was severely impaired in MyD88?/? mice compared to wild-type mice.\n Furthermore, mice deficient in chemokine receptors that contribute to monocyte recruitment to the lung were more susceptible to rMA15-induced disease and exhibited severe lung pathology similar to that seen in MyD88?/?mice.\n These data suggest that MyD88-mediated innate immune signaling and inflammatory cell recruitment to the lung are required for protection from lethal rMA15

clinical data on H5N1 cases are limited.\n\n We conducted a retrospective study of 26 confirmed human H5N1 cases identified through surveillance in China from October 2005 through April 2008.\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nData were collected from hospital medical records of H5N1 cases and analyzed.\n\n The median age was 29 years (range 6–62) and 58% were female.\n\n Many H5N1 cases reported fever (92%) and cough (58%) at illness onset, and had lower respiratory findings of tachypnea and dyspnea at admission.\n\n All cases progressed rapidly to bilateral pneumonia.\n\n Clinical complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS, 81%), cardiac failure (50%), elevated aminotransaminases (43%), and renal dysfunction (17%).\n\n Fatal cases had a lower median nadir platelet count (64.5×109 cells/L vs 93.0×109 cells/L, p?=?0.02), higher median peak lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) level (1982.5 U/L vs 1230.0 U/L, p?=?0.001), higher percentage of ARDS (94%

strains of high virulence emerging that could easily infect humans.\n\n We analyzed differential gene expression of lung epithelial cells to compare the response to H5N1 infection with a more benign infection with Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV).\n\n These gene expression data are then used as seeds to find important nodes by using a novel combination of the Gene Ontology database and the Human Network of gene interactions.\n\n Additional analysis of the data is conducted by training support vector machines (SVM) with the data and examining the orientations of the optimal hyperplanes generated.\n\n\nResults\nAnalysis of gene clustering in the Gene Ontology shows no significant clustering of genes unique to H5N1 response at 8 hours post infection.\n\n At 24 hours post infection, however, a number of significant gene clusters are found for nodes representing 'immune response' and 'response to virus' terms.\n\n There were no significant clusters of genes in the Gene Ontology for the control (Mock) or RSV experiments that were unique relative to the H5N1 response.\n\n The genes found to be most important in distinguishing H5N1 infected cells from the controls using SVM

pneumonia in humans.\n The pathogenesis of HPAIV H5N1 infection is not completely understood, although the alveolar macrophage (AM) is thought to play an important role.\n HPAIV H5N1 infection of macrophages cultured from monocytes leads to high percentages of infection accompanied by virus production and an excessive pro-inflammatory immune response.\n However, macrophages cultured from monocytes are different from AM, both in phenotype and in response to seasonal influenza virus infection.\n Consequently, it remains unclear whether the results of studies with macrophages cultured from monocytes are valid for AM.\n Therefore we infected AM and for comparison macrophages cultured from monocytes with seasonal H3N2 virus, HPAIV H5N1 or pandemic H1N1 virus, and determined the percentage of cells infected, virus production and induction of TNF-alpha, a pro-inflammatory cytokine.\n In vitro HPAIV H5N1 infection of AM compared to that of macrophages cultured from monocytes resulted in a lower percentage of infected cells (up to 25% vs up to 84%), lower virus production and lower TNF-alpha induction.\n In vitro infection of AM with H3N2 or H1N1 virus resulted in even lower percentages of infected cells (up to 7%) than with HPAIV H5N1, while virus production and TNF-alpha induction were comparable.\n In conclusion, this study reveals that macrophages cultured from monocytes are not a good model to study the interaction between AM and these influenza virus strains.\n Furthermore, the interaction between HPAIV H5N1 and AM could contribute to the pathogenicity of this virus in humans, due to the relative high percentage of infected cells rather than virus production or an excessive TNF-alpha induction.\n","id":"PMC3121882","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Debby","surname":"van Riel","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lonneke M.

pandemic influenza virus and potentially pandemic H5N1 viruses is characterized by severe lung pathology, including pulmonary edema and extensive inflammatory infiltrate.\n Here, we quantified the cellular immune response to infection in the mouse lung by flow cytometry and demonstrate that mice infected with highly pathogenic (HP) H1N1 and H5N1 influenza viruses exhibit significantly high numbers of macrophages and neutrophils in the lungs compared to mice infected with low pathogenic (LP) viruses.\n Mice infected with the 1918 pandemic virus and a recent H5N1 human isolate show considerable similarities in overall lung cellularity, lung immune cell sub-population composition and cellular immune temporal dynamics.\n Interestingly, while these similarities were observed, the HP H5N1 virus consistently elicited significantly higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in whole lungs and primary human macrophages, revealing a potentially critical difference in the pathogenesis of H5N1 infections.\n These results together show that infection with HP influenza viruses such as H5N1 and the 1918 pandemic virus leads to a rapid cell recruitment of macrophages and neutrophils into the lungs, suggesting that these cells play a role in acute lung inflammation associated with HP influenza virus infection.\n In addition, primary macrophages and dendritic cells were also susceptible to 1918 and H5N1 influenza virus infection in vitro and in infected mouse lung

Efficacy in Senescent Mice Challenged with Recombinant SARS-CoV Bearing Epidemic and Zoonotic Spike Variants ","abstract":"Background\nIn 2003, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identified as the etiological agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome, a disease characterized by severe pneumonia that sometimes results in death.\n\n SARS-CoV is a zoonotic virus that crossed the species barrier, most likely originating from bats or from other species including civets, raccoon dogs, domestic cats, swine, and rodents.\n\n A SARS-CoV vaccine should confer long-term protection, especially in vulnerable senescent populations, against both the 2003 epidemic strains and zoonotic strains that may yet emerge from animal reservoirs.\n\n We report the comprehensive investigation of SARS vaccine efficacy in young and senescent mice following homologous and heterologous challenge.\n\n\nMethods and Findings\nUsing Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicon particles (VRP) expressing the 2003 epidemic Urbani SARS-CoV strain spike (S) glycoprotein (VRP-S) or the nucleocapsid (N) protein from the same strain (VRP-N), we demonstrate that VRP-S, but not VRP-N vaccines provide complete short- and long-term protection against homologous strain challenge in young and senescent mice.\n\n To test VRP vaccine efficacy against a heterologous SARS-CoV, we used phylogenetic analyses, synthetic biology, and reverse genetics to construct a chimeric virus (icGDO3-S) encoding a synthetic S glycoprotein gene of the most genetically divergent human strain, GDO3, which clusters among the zoonotic SARS-CoV.\n\n icGD03-S replicated efficiently in human airway epithelial cells and in the lungs of young and senescent mice, and was highly resistant to neutralization with antisera directed against the Urbani strain.\n\n Although VRP-S vaccines provided complete short-term protection against heterologous icGD03-S challenge in young mice, only limited protection was seen in vaccinated senescent animals.\n\n VRP-N vaccines not only failed to protect from homologous or heterologous challenge, but resulted in enhanced immunopathology with eosinophilic infiltrates within the lungs of SARS-CoV–challenged mice.\n\n VRP-N–induced pathology presented at day 4, peaked around day 7, and persisted through day 14, and was likely mediated by cellular immune responses.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis study identifies gaps and challenges in vaccine design for controlling future SARS-CoV zoonosis, especially in vulnerable elderly populations.\n\n The availability of a SARS-CoV virus bearing heterologous S glycoproteins provides a robust challenge inoculum for evaluating vaccine efficacy against zoonotic strains, the most likely source of future outbreaks.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1716185","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Damon","surname":"Deming","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Timothy","surname":"Sheahan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mark","surname":"Heise","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Boyd","surname":"Yount","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nancy","surname":"Davis","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Amy","surname":"Sims","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mehul","surname":"Suthar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jack","surname":"Harkema","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Alan","surname":"Whitmore","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Raymond","surname":"Pickles","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ande","surname":"West","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Eric","surname":"Donaldson","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kristopher","surname":"Curtis","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Robert","surname":"Johnston","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ralph","surname":"Baric","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Joseph","surname":"Peiris","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Joseph","surname":"Peiris","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The

novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were based on information from the general population.\n\n Limited data are available for pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in pregnancy and the intrauterine vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 infection.\n\n\nMethods\nClinical records, laboratory results, and chest CT scans were retrospectively reviewed for nine pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia (ie, with maternal throat swab samples that were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) who were admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, from Jan 20 to Jan 31, 2020. Evidence of intrauterine vertical transmission was assessed by testing for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in amniotic fluid, cord blood, and neonatal throat swab samples.\n\n Breastmilk samples were also collected and tested from patients after the first lactation.\n\n\nFindings\nAll nine patients had a caesarean section in their third trimester.\n\n Seven patients presented with a fever.\n\n Other symptoms, including cough (in four of nine patients), myalgia (in three), sore throat (in two), and malaise (in two), were also observed.\n\n Fetal distress was monitored in two cases.\n\n Five of nine patients had lymphopenia (&lt;1·0?×?10? cells per L).\n\n Three patients had increased aminotransferase concentrations.\n\n None of the patients developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died, as of Feb 4, 2020. Nine livebirths were recorded.\n\n No neonatal asphyxia was observed in newborn babies.\n\n All nine livebirths had a 1-min Apgar score of 8–9 and a 5-min Apgar score of 9–10. Amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk samples from six patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and all samples tested negative for the virus.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe clinical characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women were similar to those reported for non-pregnant adult patients who developed COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n Findings from this small group of cases suggest that there is currently no evidence for intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission in women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy.\n\n\nFunding\nHubei Science and

associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.\n\n Increasing quartile of NLR was statistically significantly associated with secondary outcome.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR is associated with outcomes in unselected critically ill patients.\n\n In patients with sepsis, there was no statistically significant relationship between NLR and mortality.\n\n Further investigation is required to increase understanding of the pathophysiology of this relationship and to validate these findings with data collected prospectively.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article

a major threat to public health1–3.\n Despite intense research efforts, how, when and where new diseases appear are still a source of considerable uncertainty.\n A severe respiratory disease was recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.\n As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan.\n Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’).\n Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China5.\n This outbreak highlights the ongoing ability of viral spill-over from animals to cause

a synthetic universal control ribonucleic acid (uncRNA) containing all of the assays’ target regions on one RNA strand and spiked human blood or urine with known quantities of African or Asian Zika

Here we engineered full, partially deleted (?29?nt), and fully deleted ORF8 into a SARS-CoV infectious cDNA clone, strain Frankfurt-1. Replication of the resulting viruses was compared in primate cell cultures as well as Rhinolophus bat cells made permissive for SARS-CoV replication by lentiviral transduction of the human

SARS-CoV is a deleterious mutation acquired along the initial human-to-human transmission chain.\n The resulting loss of fitness may be due to a founder effect, which has rarely been documented in

consortium of nine European laboratories to encompass associated partners in Africa, Russia, China, Turkey, Germany and Italy.\n In 2014, the H2020 Research and Innovation Framework Programme (INFRAS

epidemic diarrhea (PED)”.\n The coronavirus referred to as PED virus (PEDV) was determined to be the etiologic agent of this disease in the late 1970s.\n Since then the disease has been reported in Europe and Asia, but the most severe outbreaks have occurred predominantly in Asian swine-producing countries.\n Most recently, PED first emerged in early 2013 in the United States that caused high morbidity and mortality associated with PED, remarkably affecting US pig production, and spread further to Canada and Mexico.\n Soon thereafter, large-scale PED epidemics recurred through the pork industry in South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan.\n These recent outbreaks and global re-emergence of PED require urgent attention and deeper understanding of PEDV biology and pathogenic mechanisms.\n This paper highlights the current knowledge of molecular epidemiology, diagnosis, and pathogenesis of PEDV, as well as prevention and control measures against PEDV infection.\n More information about the virus and the disease is still necessary for the development of effective vaccines and control strategies.\n It is hoped that this review will stimulate further basic and applied studies and encourage collaboration among producers, researchers, and swine veterinarians to provide answers that improve our understanding of PEDV and PED in an effort to eliminate this economically significant viral disease, which emerged or re-emerged worldwide.\n","id":"PMC4687282","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Changhee","surname":"Lee","email":"changhee@knu.ac.kr","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1155/2015/424860","date":"2015-03-23","title":"Progress

impact on poultry industry.\n The continuous emergence of new IBV genotypes and lack of cross protection among different IBV genotypes have been an important challenge.\n Although live attenuated IB vaccines remarkably induce potent immune response, the potential risk of reversion to virulence, neutralization by the maternal antibodies, and recombination and mutation events are important concern on their usage.\n On the other hand, inactivated vaccines induce a weaker immune response and may require multiple dosing and/or the use of adjuvants that probably have potential safety risks and increased economic burdens.\n Consequently, alternative IB vaccines are widely sought.\n Recent advances in recombinant DNA technology have resulted in experimental IB vaccines that show promise in antibody and T-cells responses, comparable to live attenuated vaccines.\n Recombinant DNA vaccines have also been enhanced to target multiple serotypes and their efficacy has been improved using delivery vectors, nanoadjuvants, and in ovo vaccination approaches.\n Although most recombinant IB DNA vaccines are yet to be licensed, it is expected that these types of vaccines may hold sway as future vaccines for inducing a cross protection against multiple IBV

strains were identified among 823 (597 immunocompetent and 226 immunocompromised) patients admitted to hospital with acute respiratory syndromes.\n Viral infections were diagnosed by either immunological (monoclonal antibodies) or molecular (RT?PCR) methods.\n Each of two sets of primer pairs developed for detection of all CoVs (panCoV) failed to detect 15 of the 53 (28.3%) hCoV strains identified.\n On the other hand, all hCoV strains could be detected by using type?specific primers targeting genes 1ab and N.\n The HuH?7 cell line was found to be susceptible to isolation and identification of OC43? and 229E?like strains.\n Overall, hCoV infection was caused by OC43?like, 229E?like, and NL63?like strains in 25 (53.2%), 10 (21.3%), and 9 (19.1%) patients, respectively.\n In addition, three patients (6.4%) were infected by untypeable hCoV strains.\n NL63?like strains were not found to circulate in 2003–2004, and 229E?like strains did not circulate in 2004–2005, while OC43?like strains were detected in both seasons.\n The monthly distribution reached a peak during January through March.\n Lower predominated over upper respiratory tract infections in each age group.\n In addition, hCoV infections interested only immunocompetent infants and young children during the first year of life, while all adults were immunocompromised patients.\n Coinfections of hCoVs and other respiratory viruses (mostly interesting the first year of life) were observed in 14 of the 47 (29.8%) patients and were associated with severe respiratory syndromes more frequently than hCoV single infections (P?=?0.002).\n In conclusion, the use of multiple primer sets targeting different genes is recommended for diagnosis of all types of hCoV infection.\n In addition, the detection of still untypeable hCoV strains suggests that the number of hCoVs involved in human pathology might further increase.\n Finally, hCoVs should be screened routinely for in both infants and immunocompromised patients with acute respiratory infection.\n J.\n Med.\n Virol.\n 78:938–949, 2006. © 2006 Wiley?Liss,

Here we report that E protein PDZ-binding motif (PBM), a domain involved in protein-protein interactions, is a major determinant of virulence.\n Elimination of SARS-CoV E protein PBM by using reverse genetics caused a reduction in the deleterious exacerbation of the immune response triggered during infection with the parental virus and virus attenuation.\n Cellular protein syntenin was identified to bind the E protein PBM during SARS-CoV infection by using three complementary strategies, yeast two-hybrid, reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy assays.\n Syntenin redistributed from the nucleus to the cell cytoplasm during infection with viruses containing the E protein PBM, activating p38 MAPK and leading to the overexpression of inflammatory cytokines.\n Silencing of syntenin using siRNAs led to a decrease in p38 MAPK activation in SARS-CoV infected cells, further reinforcing their functional relationship.\n Active p38 MAPK was reduced in lungs of mice infected with SARS-CoVs lacking E protein PBM as compared with the parental virus, leading to a decreased expression of inflammatory cytokines and to virus attenuation.\n Interestingly, administration of a p38 MAPK inhibitor led to an increase in mice survival after infection with SARS-CoV, confirming the relevance of this pathway in SARS-CoV virulence.\n Therefore, the E protein PBM is a virulence domain that activates immunopathology most likely by using syntenin as a mediator of p38 MAPK induced

coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in humans has focused attention on understanding its origins.\n Here, we assess phylogenetic relationships for the SARS-CoV lineage as well as the history of host-species shifts for SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses.\n We used a Bayesian phylogenetic inference approach with sliding window analyses of three SARS-CoV proteins: RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP), nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S).\n Conservation of RDRP allowed us to use a set of Arteriviridae taxa to root the Coronaviridae phylogeny.\n We found strong evidence for a recombination breakpoint within SARS-CoV RDRP, based on different, well supported trees for a 5? fragment (supporting SARS-CoV as sister to a clade including all other coronaviruses) and a 3? fragment (supporting SARS-CoV as sister to group three avian coronaviruses).\n These different topologies are statistically significant: the optimal 5? tree could be rejected for the 3? region, and the optimal 3? tree could be rejected for the 5? region.\n We did not find statistical evidence for recombination in analyses of N and S, as there is little signal to differentiate among alternative trees.\n Comparison of phylogenetic trees for 11 known host-species and 36 coronaviruses, representing coronavirus groups 1–3 and SARS-CoV, based on N showed statistical incongruence indicating multiple host-species shifts for coronaviruses.\n Inference of host-species associations is highly sensitive to sampling and must be considered cautiously.\n However, current sampling suggests host-species shifts between mouse and rat, chicken and turkey, mammals and manx shearwater, and humans and other mammals.\n The sister relationship between avian coronaviruses and the 3? RDRP fragment of SARS-CoV suggests an additional host-species shift.\n Demonstration of recombination in the SARS-CoV lineage indicates its potential for rapid unpredictable change, a potentially important challenge for public health management and for drug and vaccine development.\n","id":"PMC7129878","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Joshua S","surname":"Rest","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"David P","surname":"Mindell","email":"mindell@umich.edu","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.tim.2015.06.003","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Bat-to-human: spike features determining ‘host jump’ of coronaviruses SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and beyond","abstract":"\n\n\n•\nBats are natural reservoirs of many coronaviruses that can infect humans.\n","id":"PMC7125587","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Guangwen","surname":"Lu","email":"luguangwen2001@126.com","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qihui","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"George F.","surname":"Gao","email":"gaof@im.ac.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.tim.2013.05.005","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Interspecies transmission and emergence of novel viruses: lessons from bats and birds","abstract":"\n\n\n•\nBats and birds are reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.\n","id":"PMC7126491","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jasper Fuk-Woo","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kelvin Kai-Wang","surname":"To","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Herman","surname":"Tse","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dong-Yan","surname":"Jin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kwok-Yung","surname":"Yuen","email":"kyyuen@hkucc.hku.hk","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1128/JVI.01926-07","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Evidence of the recombinant origin of a bat severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronavirus and its implications on the direct ancestor of SARS coronavirus","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"World Health Organization WHO.

coronavirus (MERS-CoV).\n Because coronavirus spike glycoproteins (S) mediate virus entry, affect viral host range, and elicit neutralizing antibodies, analyzing the functions of MERS-CoV S protein is a high research priority.\n MERS-CoV S on lentivirus pseudovirions mediated entry into a variety of cell types including embryo cells from New World Eptesicus fuscus bats.\n Surprisingly, a polyclonal antibody to the S protein of MHV, a group a murine betacoronavirus, cross-reacted in immunoblots with the S2 domain of group c MERS-CoV spike protein.\n MERS pseudovirions released from 293T cells contained only uncleaved S, and pseudovirus entry was blocked by lysosomotropic reagents NH4Cl and bafilomycin and inhibitors of cathepsin L.\n However, when MERS pseudovirions with uncleaved S protein were adsorbed at 4°C to Vero E6 cells, brief trypsin treatment at neutral pH triggered virus entry at the plasma membrane and syncytia formation.\n When 293T cells producing MERS pseudotypes co-expressed serine proteases TMPRSS-2 or -4, large syncytia formed at neutral pH, and the pseudovirions produced were non-infectious and deficient in S protein.\n These experiments show that if S protein on MERS pseudovirions is uncleaved, then viruses enter by endocytosis in a cathepsin L-dependent manner, but if MERS-CoV S is cleaved, either during virus maturation by serine proteases or on pseudovirions by trypsin in extracellular fluids, then viruses enter at the plasma membrane at neutral pH and cause massive syncytia formation even in cells that express little or no MERS-CoV receptor.\n Thus, whether MERS-CoV enters cells within endosomes or at the plasma membrane depends upon the host cell type and tissue, and is determined by the location of host proteases that cleave the viral spike glycoprotein and activate membrane fusion.\n","id":"PMC3789674","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Zhaohui","surname":"Qian","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Samuel

contribution of E protein IC activity in virus pathogenesis, two recombinant mouse-adapted SARS-CoVs, each containing one single amino acid mutation that suppressed ion conductivity, were engineered.\n After serial infections, mutant viruses, in general, incorporated compensatory mutations within E gene that rendered active ion channels.\n Furthermore, IC activity conferred better

reversal potential measurements over a wide range of pH allow the dissection of the contributions to channel selectivity coming from ionizable residues of the protein transmembrane domain and also from the negatively charged groups of diphytanoyl phosphatidylserine (DPhPS) lipid.\n The corresponding effective pKas are consistent with the model pKas of the acidic residue candidates for titration.\n Second, the change of channel conductance with salt concentration reveals two distinct regimes (Donnan-controlled electrodiffusion and bulk-like electrodiffusion) fully compatible with the outcomes of selectivity experiments.\n Third, by measuring channel conductance in mixtures of neutral diphytanoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPhPC) lipids and negatively charged DPhPS lipids in low and high salt concentrations we conclude that the protein–lipid conformation in the channel is likely the same in charged and neutral lipids.\n Overall, the whole set of experiments supports the

Flexibility and Conformational Selection in the Binding Promiscuity of PDZ Domains","abstract":"In molecular recognition, it is often the case that ligand binding is coupled to conformational change in one or both of the binding partners.\n Two hypotheses describe the limiting cases involved; the first is the induced fit and the second is the conformational selection model.\n The conformational selection model requires that the protein adopts conformations that are similar to the ligand-bound conformation in the absence of ligand, whilst the induced-fit model predicts that the ligand-bound conformation of the protein is only accessible when the ligand is actually bound.\n The flexibility of the apo protein clearly plays a major role in these interpretations.\n For many proteins involved in signaling pathways there is the added complication that they are often promiscuous in that they are capable of binding to different ligand partners.\n The relationship between protein flexibility and promiscuity is an area of active research and is perhaps best exemplified by the PDZ domain family of proteins.\n In this study we use molecular dynamics simulations to examine the relationship between flexibility and promiscuity in five PDZ domains: the human Dvl2 (Dishevelled-2) PDZ domain, the human Erbin PDZ domain, the PDZ1 domain of InaD (inactivation no after-potential D protein) from fruit fly, the PDZ7 domain of GRIP1 (glutamate receptor interacting protein 1) from rat and the PDZ2 domain of PTP-BL (protein tyrosine phosphatase) from mouse.\n We show that despite their high structural similarity, the PDZ binding sites have significantly different dynamics.\n Importantly, the degree of binding pocket flexibility was found to be closely related to the various characteristics of peptide binding specificity and promiscuity of the five PDZ domains.\n Our findings suggest that the intrinsic motions of the apo structures play a key role in distinguishing functional properties of different PDZ domains and allow us to make predictions that can be experimentally tested.\n","id":"PMC3486844","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Márton","surname":"Münz","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jotun","surname":"Hein","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Philip

this mutant virus regained fitness after serial passages in cell culture or in vivo, resulting in the partial duplication of the membrane gene or in the insertion of a new sequence in gene 8a, respectively.\n The chimeric proteins generated in cell culture increased virus fitness in vitro but remained attenuated in mice.\n In contrast, during SARS-CoV-?E passage in mice, the virus incorporated a mutated variant of 8a protein, resulting in reversion to a virulent phenotype.\n When the full-length E protein was deleted or its PDZ-binding motif (PBM) was mutated, the revertant viruses either incorporated a novel chimeric protein with a PBM or restored the sequence of the PBM on the E protein, respectively.\n Similarly, after passage in mice, SARS-CoV-?E protein 8a mutated, to now encode a PBM, and also regained virulence.\n These data indicated that the virus requires a PBM on a transmembrane protein to compensate for removal of this motif from the E protein.\n To increase the genetic stability of the vaccine candidate, we introduced small attenuating deletions in E gene that did not affect the endogenous PBM, preventing the incorporation of novel chimeric proteins in the virus genome.\n In addition, to increase vaccine biosafety, we introduced additional attenuating mutations into the nsp1 protein.\n Deletions in the carboxy-terminal region of nsp1 protein led to higher host interferon responses and virus attenuation.\n Recombinant viruses including attenuating mutations in E and nsp1 genes maintained their attenuation after passage in vitro and

TGEV-infected cells.\n Immunofluorescence assays performed both on insect and mammalian cells revealed that ORF4 was a membrane-associated protein, a finding consistent with the prediction of a membrane-spanning segment in ORF4 sequence.\n Two epitopes were localized within the last 21 C-terminal residues of the sequence through peptide scanning and analysis of the reactivity of a truncated ORF4 recombinant protein.\n Since the relevant MAbs were found to induce a cell surface fluorescence, these data suggest that ORF4 may be an integral membrane protein having a Cexo-Nendo

of amino acid sequence data provided strong evidence that other coronaviruses encode a polypeptide homologous to TGEV ORF4.

established.\n Furthermore, the membrane topology of the E protein is of considerable debate, and the protein may adopt more than one topology during infection.\n We previously showed that the HD of the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) E protein is required for the efficient release of infectious virus, an activity that correlated with disruption of the secretory pathway.\n Here we report that a single residue within the hydrophobic domain, Thr16, is required for secretory pathway disruption.\n Substitutions of other residues for Thr16 were not tolerated.\n Mutations of Thr16 did not impact virus assembly as judged by virus-like particle production, suggesting that alteration of secretory pathway and assembly are independent activities.\n We also examined how the membrane topology of IBV E affected its function by generating mutant versions that adopted either a transmembrane or membrane hairpin topology.\n We found that a transmembrane topology was required for disrupting the secretory pathway, but was less efficient for virus-like particle production.\n The hairpin version of E was unable to disrupt the secretory pathway or produce particles.\n The findings reported here identify properties of the E protein that are important for its function, and provide insight into how the E protein may perform multiple roles during

autophagocytic destruction, some viruses can also subvert autophagy for their own benefit.\n The ability of influenza A virus (IAV) to evade autophagy depends on the Matrix 2 (M2) ion-channel protein.\n We show that the cytoplasmic tail of IAV M2 interacts directly with the essential autophagy protein LC3 and promotes LC3 relocalization to the unexpected destination of the plasma membrane.\n LC3 binding is mediated by a highly conserved LC3-interacting region (LIR) in M2. The M2 LIR is required for LC3 redistribution to the plasma membrane in virus-infected cells.\n Mutations in M2 that abolish LC3 binding interfere with filamentous budding and reduce virion stability.\n IAV therefore subverts autophagy by mimicking a host short linear protein-protein interaction motif.\n This strategy may facilitate transmission of infection between organisms by enhancing the stability of viral progeny.\n","id":"PMC3991421","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Rupert","surname":"Beale","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Helen","surname":"Wise","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Amanda","surname":"Stuart","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Benjamin J.","surname":"Ravenhill","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Paul","surname":"Digard","email":"paul.digard@roslin.ed.ac.uk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Felix","surname":"Randow","email":"randow@mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1128/mSystems.00135-17","date":"2017-12-27","title":"Host-Virus Protein Interaction Network Reveals the Involvement of Multiple Host Processes in the Life Cycle of Hepatitis E Virus","abstract":"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a pathogen that is transmitted by the fecal-oral route.\n Owing to the lack of an efficient laboratory model, the life cycle of the virus is poorly understood.\n During the course of infection, interactions between the viral and host proteins play essential roles, a clear understanding of which is essential to decode the life cycle of the virus.\n In this study, we identified the direct host interaction partners of all HEV proteins and generated a PPI network.\n Our functional analysis of the HEV-human PPI network reveals a role of HEV proteins in modulating multiple host biological processes such as stress and immune responses, the ubiquitin-proteasome system, energy and iron metabolism, and protein translation.\n Further investigations revealed an essential role of several host factors in HEV replication.\n Collectively, the results from our study provide a vast resource of PPI data from HEV and its human host and identify the molecular components of the viral translation/replication machinery.\n","id":"PMC5781259","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Chandru","surname":"Subramani","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Vidya P.","surname":"Nair","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Saumya","surname":"Anang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sukhen Das","surname":"Mandal","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Madhu","surname":"Pareek","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nidhi","surname":"Kaushik","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Akriti","surname":"Srivastava","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sudipto","surname":"Saha","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"Shalimar","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Baibaswata","surname":"Nayak","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"C.

features expected of the intermediate compartment between the ER and the Golgi complex.\n Here, we characterize the MHV budding compartment in more detail in mouse L cells using streptolysin O (SLO) permeabilization which allowed us to better visualize the membrane structures at the ER-Golgi boundary.\n The MHV budding compartment shares membrane continuities with the rough ER as well as with cisternal elements on one side of the Golgi stack.\n It also labeled with p58 and rab2, two markers of the intermediate compartment, and with PDI, usually considered to be a marker of the rough ER.\n The membranes of the budding compartment, as well as the budding virions themselves, but not the rough ER, labeled with the N-acetyl- galactosamine (GalNAc)-specific lectin Helix pomatia.\n When the SLO- permeabilized cells were treated with guanosine 5'-(3-O- thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S), the budding compartment accumulated a large number of beta-cop-containing buds and vesicular profiles.\n Complementary biochemical experiments were carried out to determine whether vesicular transport was required for the newly synthesized M protein, that contains only O-linked oligosaccharides, to acquire first, GalNAc and second, the Golgi modifications galactose and sialic acid.\n The results from both in vivo studies and from the use of SLO- permeabilized cells showed that, while GalNAc addition occurred under conditions which block vesicular transport, both cytosol and ATP were prerequisites for the M protein oligosaccharides to acquire Golgi modifications.\n Collectively, our data argue that transport from the rough ER to the Golgi complex requires only one vesicular transport step and that the intermediate compartment is a specialized domain of the endoplasmatic reticulum that extends to the first cisterna on the cis side of the Golgi

of Infectious Virions","abstract":"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is associated with chronic liver disease and currently affects about 3% of the world population.\n Although much has been learned about the function of individual viral proteins, the role of the HCV p7 protein in virus replication is not known.\n Recent data, however, suggest that it forms ion channels that may be targeted by antiviral compounds.\n Moreover, this protein was shown to be essential for infectivity in chimpanzee.\n Employing the novel HCV infection system and using a genetic approach to investigate the function of p7 in the viral replication cycle, we find that this protein is essential for efficient assembly and release of infectious virions across divergent virus strains.\n We show that p7 promotes virus particle production in a genotype-specific manner most likely due to interactions with other viral factors.\n Virus entry, on the other hand, is largely independent of p7, as the specific infectivity of released virions with a defect in p7 was not affected.\n Together, these observations indicate that p7 is primarily involved in the late phase of the HCV replication cycle.\n Finally, we note that p7 variants from different isolates deviate substantially in their capacity to promote virus production, suggesting that p7 is an important virulence factor that may modulate fitness and in turn virus persistence and pathogenesis.\n","id":"PMC1924870","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Eike","surname":"Steinmann","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Francois","surname":"Penin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Stephanie","surname":"Kallis","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Arvind

Viroporins are a group of proteins that interact with plasma membranes modifying permeability and can promote the release of viral particles.\n While these proteins are not essential for virus replication, their activity certainly promotes virus growth.\n Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a fatal demyelinating disease resulting from lytic infection of oligodendrocytes by the polyomavirus JC virus (JCV).\n The genome of JCV encodes six major proteins including a small auxiliary protein known as agnoprotein.\n Studies on other polyomavirus agnoproteins have suggested that the protein may contribute to viral propagation at various stages in the replication cycle, including transcription, translation, processing of late viral proteins, assembly of virions, and viral propagation.\n Previous studies from our and other laboratories have indicated that JCV agnoprotein plays an important, although as yet incompletely understood role in the propagation of JCV.\n Here, we demonstrate that agnoprotein possesses properties commonly associated with viroporins.\n Our findings demonstrate that: (i) A deletion mutant of agnoprotein is defective in virion release and viral propagation; (ii) Agnoprotein localizes to the ER early in infection, but is also found at the plasma membrane late in infection; (iii) Agnoprotein is an integral membrane protein and forms homo-oligomers; (iv) Agnoprotein enhances permeability of cells to the translation inhibitor hygromycin B; (v) Agnoprotein induces the influx of extracellular Ca2+; (vi) The basic residues at amino acid positions 8 and 9 of agnoprotein key are determinants of the viroporin activity.\n The viroporin-like properties of agnoprotein result in increased membrane permeability and alterations in intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis leading to membrane dysfunction and enhancement of virus release.\n","id":"PMC2837404","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Tadaki","surname":"Suzuki","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yasuko","surname":"Orba","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yuki","surname":"Okada","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yuji","surname":"Sunden","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Takashi","surname":"Kimura","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shinya","surname":"Tanaka","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kazuo","surname":"Nagashima","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"William

intracellular levels of cytoplasmic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]cyto) through a phospholipase C-independent pathway, which is required for virus replication and morphogenesis.\n However, the NSP4 domain and mechanism that increases [Ca2+]cyto are unknown.\n We identified an NSP4 domain (amino acids [aa] 47 to 90) that inserts into membranes and has structural characteristics of viroporins, a class of small hydrophobic viral proteins that disrupt membrane integrity and ion homeostasis to facilitate virus entry, assembly, or release.\n Mutational analysis showed that NSP4 viroporin activity was mediated by an amphipathic ?-helical domain downstream of a conserved lysine cluster.\n The lysine cluster directed integral membrane insertion of the viroporin domain and was critical for viroporin activity.\n In epithelial cells, expression of wild-type NSP4 increased the levels of free cytoplasmic Ca2+ by 3.7-fold, but NSP4 viroporin mutants maintained low levels of [Ca2+]cyto, were retained in the ER, and failed to form cytoplasmic vesicular structures, called puncta, which surround viral replication and assembly sites in rotavirus-infected cells.\n When [Ca2+]cyto was increased pharmacologically with thapsigargin, viroporin mutants formed puncta, showing that elevation of calcium levels and puncta formation are distinct functions of NSP4 and indicating that NSP4 directly or indirectly responds to elevated cytoplasmic calcium levels.\n NSP4 viroporin activity establishes the mechanism for NSP4-mediated elevation of [Ca2+]cyto, a critical event that regulates rotavirus

The ORF4a proteins formed homo-oligomers through disulfide bridges and possessed ion channel activity in both Xenopus oocytes and yeast.\n Based on the measurement of conductance to different

p7-induced loss of acidification.\n We conclude that p7 functions as a H+ permeation pathway, acting to prevent acidification in otherwise acidic intracellular compartments.\n This loss of

and Spreading","abstract":"Synthetic peptides derived from the heptad repeat (HR) of fusion (F) proteins can be used as dominant negative inhibitors to inhibit the fusion mechanism of class I viral F proteins.\n Here, we have performed a stapled-peptide scan across the HR2 domain of the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) F protein with the aim to identify a minimal domain capable of disrupting the formation of the postfusion six-helix bundle required for viral cell entry.\n Constraining the peptides with a single staple was not sufficient to inhibit RSV infection.\n However, the insertion of double staples led to the identification of novel short stapled peptides that display nanomolar potency in HEp-2 cells and are exceptionally robust to proteolytic degradation.\n By replacing each amino acid of the peptides by an alanine, we found that the substitution of residues 506 to 509, located in a patch of polar contacts between HR2 and HR1, severely affected inhibition.\n Finally, we show that intranasal delivery of the most potent peptide to BALB/c mice significantly decreased RSV infection in upper and lower respiratory tracts.\n The discovery of this minimal HR2 sequence as a means for inhibition of RSV infection provides the basis for further medicinal chemistry efforts toward developing RSV fusion

stapled peptides target both HIV-1 entry and assembly","abstract":"Background\nPreviously, we reported the conversion of the 12-mer linear and cell-impermeable peptide CAI to a cell-penetrating peptide NYAD-1 by using an i,i?+?4 hydrocarbon stapling technique and confirmed its binding to the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the HIV-1 capsid (CA) protein with an improved affinity (Kd?~?1 ?M) compared to CAI (Kd?~?15 ?M).\n\n NYAD-1 disrupts the formation of both immature- and mature-like virus particles in in vitro and cell-based assembly assays.\n\n In addition, it displays potent anti-HIV-1 activity in cell culture against a range of laboratory-adapted and primary HIV-1 isolates.\n\n\nResults\nIn this report, we expanded the study to i,i?+?7 hydrocarbon-stapled peptides to delineate their mechanism of action and antiviral activity.\n\n We identified three potent inhibitors, NYAD-36, -66 and -67, which showed strong binding to CA in NMR and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) studies and disrupted the formation of mature-like particles.\n\n They showed typical ?-helical structures and penetrated cells; however, the cell penetration was not as efficient as observed with the i,i?+?4 peptides.\n\n Unlike NYAD-1, the i,i?+?7 peptides did not have any effect on virus release; however, they impaired Gag precursor processing.\n\n HIV-1 particles produced in the presence of these peptides displayed impaired infectivity.\n\n Consistent with an effect on virus entry, selection for viral resistance led to the emergence of two mutations in the gp120 subunit of the viral envelope (Env) glycoprotein, V120Q and A327P, located in the conserved region 1 (C1) and the base of the V3 loop, respectively.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe i,i?+?7 stapled peptides derived from CAI unexpectedly target both CA and the V3 loop of gp120. This dual-targeted activity is dependent on their ability to penetrate cells as well as their net charge.\n\n This mechanistic revelation will be useful in further modifying these peptides as potent anti-HIV-1 agents.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3842668","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Hongtao","surname":"Zhang","email":"hzhang@nybloodcenter.org","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Francesca","surname":"Curreli","email":"fcurreli@nybloodcenter.org","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Abdul

that the protein possesses a number of features typical of a viroporin when it is overexpressed in bacterial and mammalian cells as well as in FMDV-infected cells.\n The protein was found to be mainly

several processes, including virus replication and pathogenesis.\n While many coronaviruses (CoVs) encode two viroporins, severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) encodes three: proteins 3a, E, and 8a.\n Additionally, proteins 3a and E have a PDZ-binding motif (PBM), which can potentially bind over 400 cellular proteins which contain a PDZ domain, making them potentially important for the control of cell function.\n In the present work, a comparative study of the functional motifs included within the SARS-CoV viroporins was performed, mostly focusing on the roles of the IC and PBM of E and 3a proteins.\n Our results showed that the full-length E and 3a proteins were required for maximal SARS-CoV replication and virulence, whereas viroporin 8a had only a minor impact on these activities.\n A virus missing both the E and 3a proteins was not viable, whereas the presence of either protein with a functional PBM restored virus viability.\n E protein IC activity and the presence of its PBM were necessary for virulence in mice.\n In contrast, the presence or absence of the homologous motifs in protein 3a did not influence virus pathogenicity.\n Therefore, dominance of the IC

with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing

for COVID-19: A systematic review of nurses’ experiences of working in acute care hospital settings during a respiratory pandemic","abstract":"Background\nPandemics and epidemics are public health emergencies that can result in substantial deaths and socio-economic disruption.\n\n Nurses play a key role in the public health response to such crises, delivering direct patient care and reducing the risk of exposure to the infectious disease.\n\n The experience of providing nursing care in this context has the potential to have significant short and long term consequences for individual nurses, society and the nursing profession.\n\n\nObjectives\nTo synthesize and present the best available evidence on the experiences of nurses working in acute hospital settings during a pandemic.\n\n\nDesign\nThis review was conducted using the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for systematic reviews.\n\n\nData sources\nA structured search using CINAHL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, MedNar, ProQuest and Index to Theses was conducted.\n\n\nReview methods\nAll studies describing nurses’ experiences were included regardless of methodology.\n\n Themes and narrative statements were extracted from included papers using the SUMARI data extraction tool from Joanna Briggs Institute.\n\n\nResults\nThirteen qualitative studies were included in the review.\n\n The experiences of 348 nurses generated a total of 116 findings, which formed seven categories based on similarity of meaning.\n\n Three synthesized findings were generated from the categories: (i) Supportive nursing teams providing quality care; (ii) Acknowledging the physical and emotional impact; and (iii) Responsiveness of systematised organizational reaction.\n\n\nConclusions\nNurses are pivotal to the health care response to infectious disease pandemics and epidemics.\n\n This systematic review emphasises that nurses’ require Governments, policy makers and nursing groups to actively engage in supporting nurses, both during and following a pandemic or epidemic.\n\n Without this, nurses are likely to experience substantial psychological issues that can lead to burnout and loss from the nursing workforce.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7206441","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ritin","surname":"Fernandez","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Heidi","surname":"Lord","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Elizabeth","surname":"Halcomb","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lorna","surname":"Moxham","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rebekkah","surname":"Middleton","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ibrahim","surname":"Alananzeh","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Laura","surname":"Ellwood","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1186/s12888-020-02898-1","date":"2020-09-24","title":"Exploring

and 2 experienced nurses who were selected through purposeful sampling from four hospitals dependent on Tehran University of Medical Sciences.\n\n\nFindings:\nParticipants' experiences were reflected in three main themes of 'functional disability', 'communicative problems', and 'managerial challenges'.\n\n Each of these dimensions consisted of several sub-categories.\n\n These areas had represented the inability to apply the learned knowledge in practice.\n\n\nDiscussion:\nThe sensitivity of health system, especially, educational mentors and nursing managers to create preparation in novice nurses by providing appropriate orientation programs at the beginning of work and the revision and amendment of nursing curriculum can solve this problem to some extent.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4825236","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Mahbobeh

the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, frontline nurses face enormous mental health challenges.\n\n Epidemiological data on the mental health statuses of frontline nurses are still limited.\n\n The aim of this study was to examine mental health (burnout, anxiety, depression, and fear) and their associated factors among frontline nurses who were caring for COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China.\n\n\nMethods\nA large-scale cross-sectional, descriptive, correlational study design was used.\n\n A total of 2,014 eligible frontline nurses from two hospitals in Wuhan, China, participated in the study.\n\n Besides sociodemographic and background data, a set of valid and reliable instruments were used to measure outcomes of burnout, anxiety, depression, fear, skin lesion, self-efficacy, resilience, and social support via the online survey in February 2020.\nFindings\nOn average, the participants had a moderate level of burnout and a high level of fear.\n\n About half of the nurses reported moderate and high work burnout, as shown in emotional exhaustion (n = 1,218, 60.5%), depersonalization (n = 853, 42.3%), and personal accomplishment (n = 1,219, 60.6%).\n\n The findings showed that 288 (14.3%), 217 (10.7%), and 1,837 (91.2%) nurses reported moderate and high levels of anxiety, depression, and fear, respectively.\n\n The majority of the nurses (n = 1,910, 94.8%) had one or more skin lesions, and 1,950 (96.8%) nurses expressed their frontline work willingness.\n\n Mental health outcomes were statistically positively correlated with skin lesion and negatively correlated with self-efficacy, resilience, social support, and frontline work willingness.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe frontline nurses experienced a variety of mental health challenges, especially burnout and fear, which warrant attention and support from policymakers.\n\n Future interventions at the national and organisational levels are needed to improve mental health during this pandemic by preventing and managing skin lesions, building self-efficacy and resilience, providing sufficient social support, and ensuring frontline work willingness.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7320259","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Deying","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yue","surname":"Kong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wengang","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qiuying","surname":"Han","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xin","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Li

settings, high patient acuity and demanding workloads, new graduate nurses continue to require greater levels of support to manage rising patient clinical care needs.\n\n Little is known about how change in new graduate nurses’ satisfaction with clinical supervision and the practice environment impacts on their transitioning experience and expectations during first year of practice.\n\n This study aimed to examine change in new graduate nurses’ perceptions over the 12-month Transitional Support Program, and identify how organizational factors and elements of clinical supervision influenced their experiences.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>Using a convergent mixed methods design, a prospective survey with open-ended questions was administered to new graduate nurses’ working in a tertiary level teaching hospital in Sydney, Australia.\n\n Nurses were surveyed at baseline (8–10 weeks) and follow-up (10–12 months) between May 2012 and August 2013. Two standardised instruments: the Manchester Clinical Supervision Scale (MCSS-26) and the Practice Environment Scale Australia (PES-AUS) were used.\n\n In addition to socio-demographic data, single –item measures were used to rate new graduate nurses’ confidence, clinical capability and support received.\n\n Participants were also able to provide open-ended comments explaining their responses.\n\n Free-text responses to the open-ended questions were initially reviewed for emergent themes, then coded as either positive or negative aspects of these preliminary themes.\n\n Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyse the quantitative data and the qualitative data was analysed using conventional content analysis (CCA).\n\n The study was approved by the relevant Human Research Ethics Committees.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>Eighty seven new graduate nurses completed the follow-up surveys, representing a 76% response rate.\n\n The median age was 23 years (Range: 20 to 53).\n\n No change was seen in new graduate nurses’ satisfaction with clinical supervision (mean MCSS-26 scores: 73.2 versus 72.2, p = 0.503), satisfaction with the clinical practice environment (mean PES-AUS scores: 112.4 versus 110.7, p = 0.298), overall satisfaction with the transitional support program (mean: 7.6 versus 7.8, p = 0.337), satisfaction with the number of study days received, orientation days received (mean: 6.4 versus 6.6, p = 0.541), unit orientation (mean: 4.4 versus 4.8, p = 0.081), confidence levels (mean: 3.6 versus 3.5, p = 0.933) and not practising beyond personal clinical capability (mean: 3.9 versus 4.0, p = 0.629).\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par5'>While transitional support programs are helpful in supporting new graduate nurses in their first year of practice, there are unmet needs for clinical, social and emotional support.\n\n Understanding new graduate nurses’ experiences and their unmet needs during their first year of practice will enable nurse managers, educators and nurses to better support new graduate nurses’ and promote confidence and competence to practice within their scope.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5534089","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Rafic","surname":"Hussein","email":"rafic.hussein@sswahs.nsw.gov.au","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bronwyn","surname":"Everett","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bronwyn","surname":"Everett","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lucie M.","surname":"Ramjan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wendy","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yenna","surname":"Salamonson","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1177/0020764020942788","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Experiences and psychosocial problems of nurses caring for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Turkey: A qualitative study","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.nedt.2019.104245","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Final clinical practicum, transition experience and turnover intentions among newly graduated nurses: A cross sectional study","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.25019/MDKE/7.1.02","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The impact of human resource development on organizational effectiveness: An empirical study","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.2147/RMHP.S258785","date":"2020-07-08","title":"The Lived Experience of Nurses Caring for Patients with COVID-19 in Iran: A Phenomenological Study","abstract":"Objective\nThis study aimed to explore the lived experiences of nurses caring for patients with COVID-19 in Iran.\n\n\nMethods\nThis study was a descriptive phenomenology.\n\n Sampling was purposefully performed, and participants were selected in terms of the inclusion criteria.\n\n Data were collected through semi-structured interviews using the WhatsApp mobile messaging application.\n\n Colaizzi’s method was used to analyse the data.\n\n The criteria introduced by Lincoln and Guba were used for the study rigour.\n\n\nResults\nThe data were obtained from 12 nurses caring for patients with COVID-19.

Understanding the early transmission dynamics of the infection and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures is crucial for assessing the potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas.\n\n Combining a mathematical model of severe SARS-CoV-2 transmission with four datasets from within and outside Wuhan, we estimated how transmission in Wuhan varied between December, 2019, and February, 2020. We used these estimates to assess the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission to occur in locations outside Wuhan if cases were introduced.\n\n\nMethods\nWe combined a stochastic transmission model with data on cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan and international cases that originated in Wuhan to estimate how transmission had varied over time during January, 2020, and February, 2020. Based on these estimates, we then calculated the probability that newly introduced cases might generate outbreaks in other areas.\n\n To estimate the early dynamics of transmission in Wuhan, we fitted a stochastic transmission dynamic model to multiple publicly available datasets on cases in Wuhan and internationally exported cases from Wuhan.\n\n The four datasets we fitted to were: daily number of new internationally exported cases (or lack thereof), by date of onset, as of Jan 26, 2020; daily number of new cases in Wuhan with no market exposure, by date of onset, between Dec 1, 2019, and Jan 1, 2020; daily number of new cases in China, by date of onset, between Dec 29, 2019, and Jan 23, 2020; and proportion of infected passengers on evacuation flights between Jan 29, 2020, and Feb 4, 2020. We used an additional two datasets for comparison with model outputs: daily number of new exported cases from Wuhan (or lack thereof) in countries with high connectivity to Wuhan (ie, top 20 most at-risk countries), by date of confirmation, as of Feb 10, 2020; and data on new confirmed cases reported in Wuhan between Jan 16, 2020, and Feb 11, 2020.\nFindings\nWe estimated that the median daily reproduction number (Rt) in Wuhan declined from 2·35 (95% CI 1·15–4·77) 1 week before travel restrictions were introduced on Jan 23, 2020, to 1·05 (0·41–2·39) 1 week after.\n\n Based on our estimates of Rt, assuming SARS-like variation, we calculated that in locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan in early January, once there are at least four independently introduced cases, there is a more than 50% chance the infection will establish within that population.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur results show that COVID-19 transmission probably declined in Wuhan during late January, 2020, coinciding with the introduction of travel control measures.\n\n As more cases arrive in international locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan before these control measures, it is likely many chains of transmission will fail to establish initially, but might lead to new outbreaks eventually.\n\n\nFunding\nWellcome Trust, Health Data Research UK, Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, and National Institute for Health Research.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7158569","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Adam J","surname":"Kucharski","email":"adam.kucharski@lshtm.ac.uk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Timothy W","surname":"Russell","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Charlie","surname":"Diamond","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"John","surname":"Edmunds","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sebastian","surname":"Funk","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rosalind M","surname":"Eggo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fiona","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mark","surname":"Jit","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"James D","surname":"Munday","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nicholas","surname":"Davies","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Amy","surname":"Gimma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kevin","surname":"van Zandvoort","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hamish","surname":"Gibbs","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Joel","surname":"Hellewell","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christopher I","surname":"Jarvis","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sam","surname":"Clifford","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Billy J","surname":"Quilty","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nikos I","surname":"Bosse","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sam","surname":"Abbott","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Petra","surname":"Klepac","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Stefan","surname":"Flasche","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1007/s00521-020-05626-8","date":"2020-12-11","title":"A review on COVID-19 forecasting models","abstract":"id='Par1'>The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has spread to more than 200 countries worldwide, leading to more than 36 million confirmed cases as of October 10, 2020.

the USA: a mathematical modelling study","abstract":"Background\nWithin 4 months of COVID-19 first being reported in the USA, it spread to every state and to more than 90% of all counties.\n\n During this period, the US COVID-19 response was highly decentralised, with stay-at-home directives issued by state and local officials, subject to varying levels of enforcement.\n\n The absence of a centralised policy and timeline combined with the complex dynamics of human mobility and the variable intensity of local outbreaks makes assessing the effect of large-scale social distancing on COVID-19 transmission in the USA a challenge.\n\n\nMethods\nWe used daily mobility data derived from aggregated and anonymised cell (mobile) phone data, provided by Teralytics (Zürich, Switzerland) from Jan 1 to April 20, 2020, to capture real-time trends in movement patterns for each US county, and used these data to generate a social distancing metric.\n\n We used epidemiological data to compute the COVID-19 growth rate ratio for a given county on a given day.\n\n Using these metrics, we evaluated how social distancing, measured by the relative change in mobility, affected the rate of new infections in the 25 counties in the USA with the highest number of confirmed cases on April 16, 2020, by fitting a statistical model for each county.\n\n\nFindings\nOur analysis revealed that mobility patterns are strongly correlated with decreased COVID-19 case growth rates for the most affected counties in the USA, with Pearson correlation coefficients above 0·7 for 20 of the 25 counties evaluated.\n\n Additionally, the effect of changes in mobility patterns, which dropped by 35–63% relative to the normal conditions, on COVID-19 transmission are not likely to be perceptible for 9–12 days, and potentially up to 3 weeks, which is consistent with the incubation time of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 plus additional time for reporting.\n\n We also show evidence that behavioural changes were already underway in many US counties days to weeks before state-level or local-level stay-at-home policies were implemented, implying that individuals anticipated public health directives where social distancing was adopted, despite a mixed political message.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThis study strongly supports a role of social distancing as an effective way to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in the USA.\n\n Until a COVID-19 vaccine is widely available, social distancing will remain one of the primary measures to combat disease spread, and these findings should serve to support more timely policy making around social distancing in the USA in the future.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7329287","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Hamada

in biology, the network vocabulary of computational biologists tends to be far more limited than that of, say, social network theorists.\n Here we review and propose several potentially useful network concepts.\n We take advantage of the relationship between network theory and the field of microarray data analysis to clarify the meaning of and the relationship among network concepts in gene coexpression networks.\n Network theory offers a wealth of intuitive concepts for describing the pairwise relationships among genes, which are depicted in cluster trees and heat maps.\n Conversely, microarray data analysis techniques (singular value decomposition, tests of differential expression) can also be used to address difficult problems in network theory.\n We describe conditions when a close relationship exists between network analysis and microarray data analysis techniques, and provide a rough dictionary for translating between the two fields.\n Using the angular interpretation of correlations, we provide a geometric interpretation of network theoretic concepts and derive unexpected relationships among them.\n We use the singular value decomposition of module expression data to characterize approximately factorizable gene coexpression networks, i.\ne.\n, adjacency matrices that factor into node specific contributions.\n High and low level views of coexpression networks allow us to study the relationships among modules and among module genes, respectively.\n We characterize coexpression networks where hub genes are significant with respect to a microarray sample trait and show that the network concept of intramodular connectivity can be interpreted as a fuzzy measure of module membership.\n We illustrate our results using human, mouse, and yeast microarray gene expression data.\n The unification of coexpression network methods with traditional data mining methods can inform the application and development of systems biologic

Human-to-human transmissions have been described with incubation times between 2-10 days, facilitating its spread via droplets, contaminated hands or surfaces.\n We therefore reviewed the literature on all available information about the persistence of human and veterinary coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces as well as inactivation strategies with biocidal agents used for chemical disinfection,

with 62–71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite within 1 minute.\n Other biocidal agents such as 0.05–0.2% benzalkonium chloride or 0.02% chlorhexidine digluconate are less

patient.\n Tracer gas experiments conducted on the eighth floor, where the initial patient was hospitalized, confirmed that the tracer gas spread to adjacent patient rooms and rooms across corridors.\n In particular, the experiment with an external wind direction and speed similar to those during the hospitalization of the initial patient revealed that the air change rate was 17–20 air changes per hour (ACH), with air introduced through the window in the room of the infected patient (room 8104).\n The tracer gas concentration of room 8110, which was the farthest room, was 7.56% of

room 8104, where there was no secondary infected patient.\n Moreover, MERS is known to spread mainly by droplets through close contact, but long-distance dispersion is probable in certain

(TGF-?)-induced expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 but attenuates Smad3/Smad4-mediated apoptosis of human peripheral lung epithelial HPL1 cells.\n The promoting effect of N protein on the transcriptional responses of TGF-? is Smad3-specific.\n N protein associates with Smad3 and promotes Smad3-p300 complex formation while it interferes with the complex formation between Smad3 and Smad4. These findings provide evidence of a novel mechanism whereby N protein modulates TGF-? signaling to block apoptosis of SARS-CoV-infected host cells and meanwhile promote tissue fibrosis.\n Our results reveal a novel mode of Smad3 action in a Smad4-independent manner and may lead to successful strategies for SARS treatment by targeting the TGF-? signaling molecules.\n","id":"PMC8740907","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xingang","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"John

Efficacy in Senescent Mice Challenged with Recombinant SARS-CoV Bearing Epidemic and Zoonotic Spike Variants ","abstract":"Background\nIn 2003, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identified as the etiological agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome, a disease characterized by severe pneumonia that sometimes results in death.\n\n SARS-CoV is a zoonotic virus that crossed the species barrier, most likely originating from bats or from other species including civets, raccoon dogs, domestic cats, swine, and rodents.\n\n A SARS-CoV vaccine should confer long-term protection, especially in vulnerable senescent populations, against both the 2003 epidemic strains and zoonotic strains that may yet emerge from animal reservoirs.\n\n We report the comprehensive investigation of SARS vaccine efficacy in young and senescent mice following homologous and heterologous challenge.\n\n\nMethods and Findings\nUsing Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicon particles (VRP) expressing the 2003 epidemic Urbani SARS-CoV strain spike (S) glycoprotein (VRP-S) or the nucleocapsid (N) protein from the same strain (VRP-N), we demonstrate that VRP-S, but not VRP-N vaccines provide complete short- and long-term protection against homologous strain challenge in young and senescent mice.\n\n To test VRP vaccine efficacy against a heterologous SARS-CoV, we used phylogenetic analyses, synthetic biology, and reverse genetics to construct a chimeric virus (icGDO3-S) encoding a synthetic S glycoprotein gene of the most genetically divergent human strain, GDO3, which clusters among the zoonotic SARS-CoV.\n\n icGD03-S replicated efficiently in human airway epithelial cells and in the lungs of young and senescent mice, and was highly resistant to neutralization with antisera directed against the Urbani strain.\n\n Although VRP-S vaccines provided complete short-term protection against heterologous icGD03-S challenge in young mice, only limited protection was seen in vaccinated senescent animals.\n\n VRP-N vaccines not only failed to protect from homologous or heterologous challenge, but resulted in enhanced immunopathology with eosinophilic infiltrates within the lungs of SARS-CoV–challenged mice.\n\n VRP-N–induced pathology presented at day 4, peaked around day 7, and persisted through day 14, and was likely mediated by cellular immune responses.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis study identifies gaps and challenges in vaccine design for controlling future SARS-CoV zoonosis, especially in vulnerable elderly populations.\n\n The availability of a SARS-CoV virus bearing heterologous S glycoproteins provides a robust challenge inoculum for evaluating vaccine efficacy against zoonotic strains, the most likely source of future outbreaks.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1716185","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Damon","surname":"Deming","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Timothy","surname":"Sheahan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mark","surname":"Heise","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Boyd","surname":"Yount","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nancy","surname":"Davis","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Amy","surname":"Sims","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mehul","surname":"Suthar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jack","surname":"Harkema","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Alan","surname":"Whitmore","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Raymond","surname":"Pickles","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ande","surname":"West","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Eric","surname":"Donaldson","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kristopher","surname":"Curtis","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Robert","surname":"Johnston","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ralph","surname":"Baric","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Joseph","surname":"Peiris","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Joseph","surname":"Peiris","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1371/journal.ppat.0030005","date":"2006-11-15","title":"A

disease.\n Young inbred mice support SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) replication in the respiratory tract and are available in sufficient numbers for statistical evaluation.\n They are relatively inexpensive and easily accessible, but their use in SARS research is limited because they do not develop illness following infection.\n Older (12- to 14-mo-old) BALB/c mice develop clinical illness and pneumonitis, but they can be hard to procure, and immune senescence complicates pathogenesis studies.\n We adapted the SARS-CoV (Urbani strain) by serial passage in the respiratory tract of young BALB/c mice.\n Fifteen passages resulted in a virus (MA15) that is lethal for mice following intranasal inoculation.\n Lethality is preceded by rapid and high titer viral replication in lungs, viremia, and dissemination of virus to extrapulmonary sites accompanied by lymphopenia, neutrophilia, and pathological changes in the lungs.\n Abundant viral antigen is extensively distributed in bronchial epithelial cells and alveolar pneumocytes, and necrotic cellular debris is present in airways and alveoli, with only mild and focal pneumonitis.\n These observations suggest that mice infected with MA15 die from an overwhelming viral infection with extensive, virally mediated destruction of pneumocytes and ciliated epithelial cells.\n The MA15 virus has six coding mutations associated with adaptation and increased virulence; when introduced into a recombinant SARS-CoV, these mutations result in a highly virulent and lethal virus (rMA15), duplicating the phenotype of the biologically derived MA15 virus.\n Intranasal inoculation with MA15 reproduces many aspects of disease seen in severe human cases of SARS.\n The availability of the MA15 virus will enhance the use of the mouse model for SARS because infection with MA15 causes morbidity, mortality, and pulmonary pathology.\n This virus will be of value as a stringent challenge in evaluation of the efficacy of

respiratory disease, SARS, with significant mortality.\n Although factors contributing to the highly pathogenic nature of SARS-CoV remain poorly understood, it has been reported that SARS-CoV infection does not induce type I interferons (IFNs) in cell culture.\n However, it is uncertain whether SARS-CoV evades host detection or has evolved mechanisms to counteract innate host defenses.\n We show here that infection of SARS-CoV triggers a weak IFN response in cultured human lung/bronchial epithelial cells without inducing the phosphorylation of IFN-regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), a latent cellular transcription factor that is pivotal for type I IFN synthesis.\n Furthermore, SARS-CoV infection blocked the induction of IFN antiviral activity and the up-regulation of protein expression of a subset of IFN-stimulated genes triggered by double-stranded RNA or an unrelated paramyxovirus.\n In searching for a SARS-CoV protein capable of counteracting innate immunity, we identified the papain-like protease (PLpro) domain as a potent IFN antagonist.\n The inhibition of the IFN response does not require the protease activity of PLpro.\n Rather, PLpro interacts with IRF-3 and inhibits the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF-3, thereby disrupting the activation of type I IFN responses through either Toll-like receptor 3 or retinoic acid-inducible gene I/melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 pathways.\n Our data suggest that regulation of IRF-3-dependent innate antiviral defenses by PLpro may contribute to the establishment of SARS-CoV

Furthermore, high levels of macrophage-inflammatory protein (MIP)-1?, MIP-1?, and MIP-2 mRNA were observed at the onset of MHV-JHM infection and correlated with a marked elevation in the number of

syndrome (SARS) and that the SARS coronavirus (SARS?CoV) nucleoprotein is detectable in the lungs, and other organs and tissues, in these patients.\n In the present study, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization (ISH) assays were used to analyse the expression of angiotensin?converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), SARS?CoV spike (S) protein, and some pro?inflammatory cytokines (PICs) including MCP?1, TGF??1, TNF??, IL?1?, and IL?6 in autopsy tissues from four patients who died of SARS.\n SARS?CoV S protein and its RNA were only detected in ACE2+ cells in the lungs and other organs, indicating that ACE2?expressing cells are the primary targets for SARS?CoV infection in vivo in humans.\n High levels of PICs were expressed in the SARS?CoV?infected ACE2+ cells, but not in the uninfected cells.\n These results suggest that cells infected by SARS?CoV produce elevated levels of PICs which may cause immuno?mediated damage to the lungs and other organs, resulting in ALI and, subsequently, multi?organ dysfunction.\n Therefore application of PIC antagonists may reduce the severity and mortality of SARS.\n Copyright © 2006 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.\n

the ability of the virus to circumvent innate immunity.\n Using functional genomics, we analyzed early host responses to SARS-CoV infection in the lungs of adolescent cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) that show lung pathology similar to that observed in human adults with SARS.\n Analysis of gene signatures revealed induction of a strong innate immune response characterized by the stimulation of various cytokine and chemokine genes, including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and IP-10, which corresponds to the host response seen in acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n As opposed to many in vitro experiments, SARS-CoV induced a wide range of type I interferons (IFNs) and nuclear translocation of phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 in the lungs of macaques.\n Using immunohistochemistry, we revealed that these antiviral signaling pathways were differentially regulated in distinctive subsets of cells.\n Our studies emphasize that the induction of early IFN signaling may be critical to confer protection against SARS-CoV infection and highlight the strength of combining functional genomics with immunohistochemistry to further unravel the

effectiveness of treatment options.\n\n The World Health Organization (WHO) expert panel on SARS treatment requested a systematic review and comprehensive summary of treatments used for SARS-infected patients in order to guide future treatment and identify priorities for research.\n\n\nMethods and Findings\nIn response to the WHO request we conducted a systematic review of the published literature on ribavirin, corticosteroids, lopinavir and ritonavir (LPV/r), type I interferon (IFN), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and SARS convalescent plasma from both in vitro studies and in SARS patients.\n\n We also searched for clinical trial evidence of treatment for acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n Sources of data were the literature databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) up to February 2005. Data from publications were extracted and evidence within studies was classified using predefined criteria.\n\n In total, 54 SARS treatment studies, 15 in vitro studies, and three acute respiratory distress syndrome studies met our inclusion criteria.\n\n Within in vitro studies, ribavirin, lopinavir, and type I IFN showed inhibition of SARS-CoV in tissue culture.\n\n In SARS-infected patient reports on ribavirin, 26 studies were classified as inconclusive, and four showed possible harm.\n\n Seven studies of convalescent plasma or IVIG, three of IFN type I, and two of LPV/r were inconclusive.\n\n In 29 studies of steroid use, 25 were inconclusive and four were classified as causing possible harm.\n\n\nConclusions\nDespite an extensive literature reporting on SARS treatments, it was not possible to determine whether treatments benefited patients during the SARS outbreak.\n\n Some may have been harmful.\n\n Clinical trials should be designed to validate a standard protocol for dosage and timing, and to accrue data in real time during future outbreaks to monitor specific adverse effects and help inform treatment.\n\n\n","id":"PMC1564166","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Lauren

acute respiratory infection in the Arabian Peninsula, Tunisia, Morocco, France, Italy, Germany, and the UK.\n\n We provide a full description of a fatal case of MERS-CoV infection and associated phylogenetic analyses.\n\n\nMethods\nWe report data for a patient who was admitted to the Klinikum Schwabing (Munich, Germany) for severe acute respiratory infection.\n\n We did diagnostic RT-PCR and indirect immunofluorescence.\n\n From time of diagnosis, respiratory, faecal, and urine samples were obtained for virus quantification.\n\n We constructed a maximum likelihood tree of the five available complete MERS-CoV genomes.\n\n\nFindings\nA 73-year-old man from Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, was transferred to Klinikum Schwabing on March 19, 2013, on day 11 of illness.\n\n He had been diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 2008, and had received several lines of treatment.\n\n The patient died on day 18, due to septic shock.\n\n MERS-CoV was detected in two samples of bronchoalveolar fluid.\n\n Viral loads were highest in samples from the lower respiratory tract (up to 1·2?×?106 copies per mL).\n\n Maximum virus concentration in urine samples was 2691 RNA copies per mL on day 13; the virus was not present in the urine after renal failure on day 14. Stool samples obtained on days 12 and 16 contained the virus, with up to 1031 RNA copies per g (close to the lowest detection limit of the assay).\n\n One of two oronasal swabs obtained on day 16 were positive, but yielded little viral RNA (5370 copies per mL).\n\n No virus was detected in blood.\n\n The full virus genome was combined with four other available full genome sequences in a maximum likelihood phylogeny, correlating branch lengths with dates of isolation.\n\n The time of the common ancestor was halfway through 2011. Addition of novel genome data from an unlinked case treated 6 months previously in Essen, Germany, showed a clustering of viruses derived from Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.\n\n\nInterpretation\nWe have provided the first complete viral load profile in a case of MERS-CoV infection.\n\n MERS-CoV might have shedding patterns that are different from those of severe acute respiratory syndrome and so might need alternative diagnostic approaches.\n\n\nFunding\nEuropean Union; German Centre for Infection Research; German Research Council; and German Ministry for

coronavirus: estimation of pandemic risk","abstract":"Background\nThe new Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection shares many clinical, epidemiological, and virological similarities with that of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV.\n\n We aimed to estimate virus transmissibility and the epidemic potential of MERS-CoV, and to compare the results with similar findings obtained for prepandemic SARS.\n\n\nMethods\nWe retrieved data for MERS-CoV clusters from the WHO summary and subsequent reports, and published descriptions of cases, and took into account 55 of the 64 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV reported as of June 21, 2013, excluding cases notified in the previous 2 weeks.\n\n To assess the interhuman transmissibility of MERS-CoV, we used Bayesian analysis to estimate the basic reproduction number (R0) and compared it to that of prepandemic SARS.\n\n We considered two scenarios, depending on the interpretation of the MERS-CoV cluster-size data.\n\n\nResults\nWith our most pessimistic scenario (scenario 2), we estimated MERS-CoV R0 to be 0·69 (95% CI 0·50–0·92); by contrast, the R0 for prepandemic SARS-CoV was 0·80 (0·54–1·13).\n\n Our optimistic scenario (scenario 1) yielded a MERS-CoV R0 of 0·60 (0·42–0·80).\n\n Because of recent implementation of effective contact tracing and isolation procedures, further MERS-CoV transmission data might no longer describe an entire cluster, but only secondary infections directly caused by the index patient.\n\n Hence, we calculated that, under scenario 2, eight or more secondary infections caused by the next index patient would translate into a 5% or higher chance that the revised MERS-CoV R0 would exceed 1—ie, that MERS-CoV might have pandemic potential.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur analysis suggests that MERS-CoV does not yet have pandemic potential.\n\n We recommend enhanced surveillance, active contact tracing, and vigorous searches for the MERS-CoV animal hosts and transmission routes to human beings.\n\n\nFunding\nAgence Nationale de la Recherche (Labex Integrative Biology of Emerging Infectious Diseases), and the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme project

We report detailed clinical and virological data for two related cases of MERS-CoV disease, after nosocomial transmission of the virus from one patient to another in a French hospital.\n\n\nMethods\nPatient 1 visited Dubai in April, 2013; patient 2 lives in France and did not travel abroad.\n\n Both patients had underlying immunosuppressive disorders.\n\n We tested specimens from the upper (nasopharyngeal swabs) or the lower (bronchoalveolar lavage, sputum) respiratory tract and whole blood, plasma, and serum specimens for MERS-CoV by real-time RT-PCR targeting the upE and Orf1A genes of MERS-CoV.\n\n\nFindings\nInitial clinical presentation included fever, chills, and myalgia in both patients, and for patient 1, diarrhoea.\n\n Respiratory symptoms rapidly became predominant with acute respiratory failure leading to mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).\n\n Both patients developed acute renal failure.\n\n MERS-CoV was detected in lower respiratory tract specimens with high viral load (eg, cycle threshold [Ct] values of 22·9 for upE and 24 for Orf1a for a bronchoalveolar lavage sample from patient 1; Ct values of 22·5 for upE and 23·9 for Orf1a for an induced sputum sample from patient 2), whereas nasopharyngeal specimens were weakly positive or inconclusive.\n\n The two patients shared the same room for 3 days.\n\n The incubation period was estimated at 9–12 days for the second case.\n\n No secondary transmission was documented in hospital staff despite the absence of specific protective measures before the diagnosis of MERS-CoV was suspected.\n\n Patient 1 died on May 28, due to refractory multiple organ failure.\n\n\nInterpretation\nPatients with respiratory symptoms returning from the Middle East or exposed to a confirmed case should be isolated and investigated for MERS-CoV with lower respiratory tract sample analysis and an assumed incubation period of 12 days.\n\n Immunosuppression should also be taken into account as a risk factor.\n\n\nFunding\nFrench Institute for Public Health Surveillance, ANR grant Labex Integrative Biology of Emerging Infectious

Infection with Novel Human Coronavirus EMC Predicts Potential Antivirals and Important Differences with SARS Coronavirus","abstract":"A novel human coronavirus (HCoV-EMC) was recently identified in the Middle East as the causative agent of a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) resembling the illness caused by SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV).\n Although derived from the CoV family, the two viruses are genetically distinct and do not use the same receptor.\n Here, we investigated whether HCoV-EMC and SARS-CoV induce similar or distinct host responses after infection of a human lung epithelial cell line.\n HCoV-EMC was able to replicate as efficiently as SARS-CoV in Calu-3 cells and similarly induced minimal transcriptomic changes before 12 h postinfection.\n Later in infection, HCoV-EMC induced a massive dysregulation of the host transcriptome, to a much greater extent than SARS-CoV.\n Both viruses induced a similar activation of pattern recognition receptors and the interleukin 17 (IL-17) pathway, but HCoV-EMC specifically down-regulated the expression of several genes within the antigen presentation pathway, including both type I and II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes.\n This could have an important impact on the ability of the host to mount an adaptive host response.\n A unique set of 207 genes was dysregulated early and permanently throughout infection with HCoV-EMC, and was used in a computational screen to predict potential antiviral compounds, including kinase inhibitors and glucocorticoids.\n Overall, HCoV-EMC and SARS-CoV elicit distinct host gene expression responses, which might impact in vivo pathogenesis and could orient therapeutic strategies against that emergent virus.\n","id":"PMC3663187","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Laurence","surname":"Josset","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Vineet

during Early Lung Development","abstract":"Many organs of higher organisms, such as the vascular system, lung, kidney, pancreas, liver and glands, are heavily branched structures.\n The branching process during lung development has been studied in great detail and is remarkably stereotyped.\n The branched tree is generated by the sequential, non-random use of three geometrically simple modes of branching (domain branching, planar and orthogonal bifurcation).\n While many regulatory components and local interactions have been defined an integrated understanding of the regulatory network that controls the branching process is lacking.\n We have developed a deterministic, spatio-temporal differential-equation based model of the core signaling network that governs lung branching morphogenesis.\n The model focuses on the two key signaling factors that have been identified in experiments, fibroblast growth factor (FGF10) and sonic hedgehog (SHH) as well as the SHH receptor patched (Ptc).\n We show that the reported biochemical interactions give rise to a Schnakenberg-type Turing patterning mechanisms that allows us to reproduce experimental observations in wildtype and mutant mice.\n The kinetic parameters as well as the domain shape are based on experimental data where available.\n The developed model is robust to small absolute and large relative changes in the parameter values.\n At the same time there is a strong regulatory potential in that the switching between branching modes can be achieved by targeted changes in the parameter values.\n We note that the sequence of different branching events may also be the result of different growth speeds: fast growth triggers lateral branching while slow growth favours bifurcations in our model.\n We conclude that the FGF10-SHH-Ptc1 module is sufficient to generate pattern that correspond to the observed branching modes.\n","id":"PMC3280966","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Denis","surname":"Menshykau","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Conradin","surname":"Kraemer","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dagmar","surname":"Iber","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Edmund

The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days

Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12

patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar

general ward.\n Performing HP/CRRT at the early stages of ARDS can obviate the need for intubating patients with COVID-19. Punctual and early use of HP and CRRT in the treatment of ARDS in patients with COVID-19 prevented the progression of ARDS and patient intubation, reduced respiratory distress and the patient's

study\nTo observe the clinical effect of plasmapheresis on excessive inflammatory reaction and immune features in patients with severe COVID-19 at risk of ARDS.\n\n\nMaterials and methods\nIn this single-center study, we included 15 confirmed cases of COVID-19 at Masih Daneshvari Hospital, in March 2020 in Tehran, Iran.\n\n COVID-19 cases were confirmed by RT-PCR and CT imaging according to WHO guidelines.\n\n Plasmapheresis was performed to alleviate cytokine-induced ARDS.\n\n The improvement in oxygen delivery (PaO2/FiO2), total number of T cells, liver enzymes, acute reaction proteins, TNF-? and IL-6 levels were evaluated.\n\n\nResults\nInflammatory cytokine levels (TNF-?, IL-6), and acute phase reaction proteins including ferritin and CRP were high before plasmapheresis.\n\n After plasmapheresis, the levels of PaO2/FiO2, acute phase reactants, inflammatory mediators, liver enzymes and bilirubin were significantly reduced within a week (p?&lt;?0.05).\n\n In contrast, although

complication of COVID-19 most commonly resulting in respiratory failure.\n\n This ten-patient study was designed to determine the efficacy of therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) in improving oxygenation and in reducing the cytokine load in a critically ill subset of patients.\n\n\nMethods\nFive single volume plasma exchanges over eight days within a 14-day study period.\n\n In mechanically ventilated patients, oxygenation was measured via the PaO2/FiO2 (P/F) ratio and the oxygenation index (OI) daily for 14 days.\n\n Supplemental oxygen requirements were tracked daily for non-ventilated patients.\n\n\nResults\nNon-ventilated patients were liberated from supplemental oxygen after TPE.\n\n The response was rapid with an 87% average reduction in oxygenation requirements following and average time to return to room air of 5.25 days.\n\n All mechanically ventilated patients demonstrated improvement in oxygenation with a 78% average improvement in the P/F ratio and a 43% improvement in OI.\n\n C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum levels of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF?, IFN? and GM-CSF, were measured daily with immediate post TPE levels drawn on days 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8.

this retrospective cohort study, we included adults (aged ?16 years) with laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection and pneumonia needing ventilation support, diagnosed between Oct 23, 2012, and May 1, 2014, at the Prince Sultan Military Medical City (Riyadh, Saudi Arabia).\n\n All patients received appropriate supportive care and regular clinical and laboratory monitoring, but patients diagnosed after Sept 16, 2013, were also given oral ribavirin (dose based on calculated creatinine clearance, for 8–10 days) and subcutaneous pegylated interferon alfa-2a (180 ?g per week for 2 weeks).\n\n The primary endpoint was 14-day and 28-day survival from the date of MERS-CoV infection diagnosis.\n\n We used ?2 and Fischer's exact test to analyse categorical variables and the t test to analyse continuous variables.\n\n\nFindings\nWe analysed 20 patients who received ribavirin and interferon (treatment group; initiated a median of 3 days [range 0–8] after diagnosis) and 24 who did not (comparator group).\n\n Baseline clinical and laboratory characteristics were similar between groups, apart from baseline absolute neutrophil count, which was significantly lower in the comparator

relatively high concentrations; however, when combined, lower concentrations of interferon-?2b and ribavirin achieved comparable endpoints.\n Thus, a combination of interferon-?2b and ribavirin, which are already commonly used in the clinic, may be useful for patient management in the event of future nCoV infections.\n","id":"PMC3629412","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Darryl","surname":"Falzarano","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Emmie","surname":"de

best treatment to propose.\n The World Health Organization, as well as several other national agencies, are still working on different clinical approaches to implement the most relevant treatment in MERS-CoV infection.\n We compared innate and adaptive immune responses of two patients infected with MERS-CoV to understand the underlying mechanisms involved in the response and propose potential therapeutic approaches.\n Broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) of the first week and sera of the first month from the two patients were used in this study.\n Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRTPCR) was performed after extraction of RNA from BAL cells of MERS-CoV infected patients and control patients.\n BAL supernatants and sera were used to assess cytokines and chemokines secretion by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.\n The first patient died rapidly after 3 weeks in the intensive care unit, the second patient still recovers from infection.\n The patient with a poor outcome (patient 1), compared to patient 2, did not promote type-1 Interferon (IFN), and particularly IFN?, in response to double stranded RNA (dsRNA) from MERS-CoV.\n The absence of IFN?, known to promote antigen presentation in response to viruses, impairs the development of a robust antiviral adaptive Th-1 immune response.\n This response is mediated by IL-12 and IFN? that decreases viral clearance; levels of both of these mediators were decreased in patient 1. Finally, we confirm previous in vitro findings that MERS-CoV can drive IL-17 production in humans.\n Host recognition of viral dsRNA determines outcome in the early stage of MERS-CoV infection.\n We highlight the critical role of IFN? in this initial stage to orchestrate a robust immune response and bring substantial arguments for the indication of early IFN? treatment during MERS-CoV infection.\n","id":"PMC3925152","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Emmanuel","surname":"Faure","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Julien","surname":"Poissy","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Anne","surname":"Goffard","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Clement","surname":"Fournier","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Eric","surname":"Kipnis","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Marie","surname":"Titecat","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Perinne","surname":"Bortolotti","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Laura","surname":"Martinez","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sylvain","surname":"Dubucquoi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rodrigue","surname":"Dessein","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Philippe","surname":"Gosset","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Daniel","surname":"Mathieu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Benoit","surname":"Guery","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fausto","surname":"Baldanti","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fausto","surname":"Baldanti","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1128/JVI.03496-12","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Human cell tropism and innate immune system interactions of human respiratory coronavirus EMC compared to those of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1099/vir.0.052910-0","date":"2013-04-22","title":"MERS-coronavirus replication induces severe <italic>in vitro</italic> cytopathology and is strongly inhibited by cyclosporin A or interferon-? treatment","abstract":"Coronavirus (CoV) infections are commonly associated with respiratory and enteric disease in humans and animals.\n The 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) highlighted the potentially lethal consequences of CoV-induced disease in humans.\n In 2012, a novel CoV (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus; MERS-CoV) emerged, causing 49 human cases thus far, of which 23 had a fatal outcome.\n In this study, we characterized MERS-CoV replication and cytotoxicity in human and monkey cell lines.\n Electron microscopy of infected Vero cells revealed extensive membrane rearrangements, including the formation of double-membrane vesicles and convoluted membranes, which have been implicated previously in the RNA synthesis of SARS-CoV and other CoVs.\n Following infection, we observed rapidly increasing viral RNA synthesis and release of high titres of infectious progeny, followed by a pronounced cytopathology.\n These characteristics were used to develop an assay for antiviral compound screening in 96-well format, which was used to identify cyclosporin A as an inhibitor of MERS-CoV replication in cell culture.\n Furthermore, MERS-CoV was found to be 50–100 times more sensitive to alpha interferon (IFN-?) treatment than SARS-CoV, an observation that may have important implications for the treatment of MERS-CoV-infected patients.\n MERS-CoV infection did not prevent the IFN-induced nuclear translocation of phosphorylated STAT1, in contrast to infection with SARS-CoV where this block inhibits the expression of antiviral genes.\n These findings highlight relevant differences between these distantly related zoonotic CoVs in terms of their interaction with and evasion of the cellular innate immune response.\n","id":"PMC3749523","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Adriaan H.","surname":"de Wilde","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"V.

Diagnosis was confirmed in all patients using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction on respiratory samples.\n\n\nResults\nDuring the observation period, 31 patients were admitted with MERS-CoV infection (mean age 59?±?20 years, 22 [71 %] males).\n\n Cough and tachypnea were reported in all patients; 22 (77.4 %) patients had bilateral pulmonary infiltrates.\n\n Invasive mechanical ventilation was applied in 27 (87.1 %) and vasopressor therapy in 25 (80.6 %) patients during the intensive care unit stay.\n\n Twenty-three (74.2 %) patients died in the ICU.\n\n Nonsurvivors were older, had greater APACHE II and SOFA scores on admission, and were more likely to have received invasive mechanical ventilation and vasopressor therapy.\n\n After adjustment for the severity of illness and the degree of organ dysfunction, the need for vasopressors was an independent risk factor for death in the ICU (odds ratio?=?18.33, 95 % confidence interval: 1.11–302.1, P?=?0.04).\n\n\nConclusions\nMERS-CoV infection requiring admission to the ICU is associated with high morbidity and mortality.\n\n The need for vasopressor therapy is the main risk factor for death in these patients.\n\n\nElectronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13054-016-1303-8) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).\n\n However, the actual number of infections in people who have had contact with camels is unknown and most index patients cannot recall any such contact.\n\n We aimed to do a nationwide serosurvey in Saudi Arabia to establish the prevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies, both in the general population and in populations of individuals who have maximum exposure to camels.\n\n\nMethods\nIn the cross-sectional serosurvey, we tested human serum samples obtained from healthy individuals older than 15 years who attended primary health-care centres or participated in a national burden-of-disease study in all 13 provinces of Saudi Arabia.\n\n Additionally, we tested serum samples from shepherds and abattoir workers with occupational exposure to camels.\n\n Samples were screened by recombinant ELISA and MERS-CoV seropositivity was confirmed by recombinant immunofluorescence and plaque reduction neutralisation tests.\n\n We used two-tailed Mann Whitney U exact tests, ?2, and Fisher's exact tests to analyse the data.\n\n\nFindings\nBetween Dec 1, 2012, and Dec 1, 2013, we obtained individual serum samples from 10?009 individuals.\n\n Anti-MERS-CoV antibodies were confirmed in 15 (0·15%; 95% CI 0·09–0·24) of 10?009 people in six of the 13 provinces.\n\n The mean age of seropositive individuals was significantly younger than that of patients with reported, laboratory-confirmed, primary Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (43·5 years [SD 17·3] vs 53·8 years [17·5]; p=0·008).\n\n Men had a higher antibody prevalence than did women (11 [0·25%] of 4341 vs two [0·05%] of 4378; p=0·028) and antibody prevalence was significantly higher in central versus coastal provinces (14 [0·26%] of 5479 vs one [0·02%] of 4529; p=0·003).\n\n Compared with the general population, seroprevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies was significantly increased by 15 times in shepherds (two [2·3%] of 87, p=0·0004) and by 23 times in slaughterhouse workers (five [3·6%] of 140; p&lt;0·0001).\n\n\nInterpretation\nSeroprevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies was significantly higher in camel-exposed individuals than in the general population.\n\n By simple multiplication, a projected 44?951 (95% CI 26?971–71?922) individuals older than 15 years might be seropositive for MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia.\n\n These individuals might be the source of infection for patients with confirmed MERS who had no previous exposure to camels.\n\n\nFunding\nEuropean Union, German Centre for Infection Research, Federal Ministry of Education and

had been more than 5 years since the first case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus infection (MERS-CoV) was recorded, but no specific treatment has been investigated in randomized clinical trials.\n\n Results from in vitro and animal studies suggest that a combination of lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon-?1b (IFN-?1b) may be effective against MERS-CoV.\n\n The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of treatment with a combination of lopinavir/ritonavir and recombinant IFN-?1b provided with standard supportive care, compared to treatment with placebo provided with standard supportive care in patients with laboratory-confirmed MERS requiring hospital admission.\n\n\nMethods\nid='Par2'>The protocol is prepared in accordance with the SPIRIT (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials) guidelines.\n\n Hospitalized adult patients with laboratory-confirmed MERS will be enrolled in this recursive, two-stage, group sequential, multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind randomized controlled trial.\n\n The trial is initially designed to include 2 two-stage components.\n\n The first two-stage component is designed to adjust sample size and determine futility stopping, but not efficacy stopping.\n\n The second two-stage component is designed to determine efficacy stopping and possibly readjustment of sample size.\n\n The primary outcome is 90-day mortality.\n\n\nDiscussion\nid='Par3'>This will be the first randomized controlled trial of a potential treatment for MERS.\n\n The study is sponsored by King

extension, and termination of RNA synthesis by a paramyxovirus polymerase","abstract":"Paramyxoviruses represent a family of RNA viruses causing significant human diseases.\n These include measles virus, the most infectious virus ever reported, in addition to parainfluenza virus, and other emerging viruses.\n Paramyxoviruses likely share common replication machinery but their mechanisms of RNA biosynthesis activities and details of their complex polymerase structures are unknown.\n Mechanistic and functional details of a paramyxovirus polymerase would have sweeping implications for understanding RNA virus replication and for the development of new antiviral medicines.\n To study paramyxovirus polymerase structure and function, we expressed an active recombinant Nipah virus (NiV) polymerase complex assembled from the multifunctional NiV L protein bound to its phosphoprotein cofactor.\n NiV is an emerging highly pathogenic virus that causes severe encephalitis and has been declared a global public health concern due to its high mortality rate.\n Using negative-stain electron microscopy, we demonstrated NiV polymerase forms ring-like particles resembling related RNA polymerases.\n We identified conserved sequence elements driving recognition of the 3?-terminal genomic promoter by NiV polymerase, and leading to initiation of RNA synthesis, primer extension, and transition to elongation mode.\n Polyadenylation resulting from NiV polymerase stuttering provides a mechanistic basis for transcription termination.\n It also suggests a divergent adaptation in promoter recognition between pneumo- and paramyxoviruses.\n The lack of available antiviral therapy for NiV prompted us to identify the triphosphate forms of R1479 and GS-5734, two clinically relevant nucleotide analogs, as substrates and inhibitors of NiV polymerase activity by delayed chain termination.\n Overall, these findings provide low-resolution structural details and the mechanism of an RNA polymerase from a previously uncharacterized virus family.\n This work illustrates important functional differences yet remarkable similarities between the polymerases of nonsegmented negative-strand RNA viruses.\n","id":"PMC5823471","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Paul

there are no approved therapeutics for any human CoV presenting a clear unmet medical need.\n Remdesivir (RDV, GS-5734) is a monophosphoramidate prodrug of an adenosine analog with potent activity against an array of RNA virus families including Filoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Pneumoviridae, and Orthocoronavirinae, through the targeting of the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp).\n We developed multiple assays to further define the breadth of RDV antiviral activity against the CoV family.\n Here, we show potent antiviral activity of RDV against endemic human CoVs OC43 (HCoV-OC43) and 229E (HCoV-229E) with submicromolar EC50 values.\n Of known CoVs, the members of the deltacoronavirus genus have the most divergent RdRp as compared to SARS- and MERS-CoV and both avian and porcine members harbor a native residue in the RdRp that confers resistance in beta-CoVs.\n Nevertheless, RDV is highly efficacious against porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV).\n These data further

bronchioles.\n From 4 to 6 days postinfection, interstitial pneumonia with alveolar collapse expanded throughout the lungs.\n From 6 to 9 days postinfection, DAD with severe alveolar collapse was

macaque model of MERS-CoV has been established, the lack of uniform, severe disease in this model complicates the analysis of countermeasure studies.\n Modeling of the interaction between the MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein and its receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 predicted comparable interaction energies in common marmosets and humans.\n The suitability of the marmoset as a MERS-CoV model was tested by inoculation via combined intratracheal, intranasal, oral and ocular routes.\n Most of the marmosets developed a progressive severe pneumonia leading to euthanasia of some animals.\n Extensive lesions were evident in the lungs of all animals necropsied at different time points post inoculation.\n Some animals were also viremic; high viral loads were detected in the lungs of all infected animals, and total RNAseq demonstrated the induction of immune and inflammatory pathways.\n This is the first description of a severe, partially lethal, disease model of MERS-CoV, and as such will have a major impact on the ability to assess the efficacy of vaccines and treatment strategies as well as allowing more detailed pathogenesis

in the Republic of Korea","abstract":"Background\nFrom May to July 2015, the Republic of Korea experienced the largest outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outside the Arabian Peninsula.\n\n A total of 186 patients, including 36 deaths, had been diagnosed with MERS-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection as of September 30th, 2015.\nMaterials and Methods\nWe obtained information of patients who were confirmed to have MERS-CoV infection.\n\n MERS-CoV infection was diagnosed using real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 55 years (range, 16 to 86).\n\n A total of 55.4% of the patients had one or more coexisting medical conditions.\n\n The most common symptom was fever (95.2%).\n\n At admission, leukopenia (42.6%), thrombocytopenia (46.6%), and elevation of aspartate aminotransferase (42.7%) were observed.\n\n Pneumonia was detected in 68.3% of patients at admission and developed in 80.8% during the disease course.\n\n Antiviral agents were used for 74.7% of patients.\n\n Mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and convalescent serum were employed for 24.5%, 7.1%, and 3.8% of patients, respectively.\n\n Older age, presence of coexisting medical conditions including diabetes or chronic lung disease, presence of dyspnea, hypotension, and leukocytosis at admission, and the use of mechanical ventilation were revealed to be independent predictors of death.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe clinical features of MERS-CoV infection in the Republic of Korea were similar to those of previous outbreaks in the Middle East.\n\n However, the overall mortality rate (20.4%) was lower than that in previous reports.\n\n Enhanced surveillance and active management of patients during the outbreak may have resulted in improved outcomes.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4945721","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Won

and epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and Prevention of Infectious Disease in China,

Unfortunately, there are few tools available to functionally test these viruses for their ability to infect humans, which has severely hampered efforts to predict the next zoonotic viral outbreak.\n Here, we developed an approach to rapidly screen lineage B betacoronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and the recent SARS-CoV-2, for receptor usage and their ability to infect cell types from different species.\n We show that host protease processing during viral entry is a significant barrier for several lineage B viruses and that bypassing this barrier allows several lineage B viruses to enter

however, the genetic mechanisms underlying cross-species adaptation remain poorly understood.\n Variation in the host receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), can block the interaction with the MERS-CoV spike protein and form a species barrier to infection.\n To better understand the species adaptability of MERS-CoV, we identified a suboptimal species-derived variant of DPP4 to study viral adaption.\n Passaging virus on cells expressing this DPP4 variant led to accumulation of mutations in the viral spike which increased replication.\n Parallel passages revealed distinct paths of viral adaptation to the same DPP4 variant.\n Structural analysis and functional assays showed that these mutations enhanced viral entry with suboptimal DPP4 by altering the surface charge of spike.\n These

implication of a novel beta (?)-CoV as the cause of fatal respiratory disease in the Middle East emphasizes the importance of surveillance for CoVs that have potential to move from bats into the human population.\n In a screen of 606 bats from 42 different species in Campeche, Chiapas and Mexico City we identified 13 distinct CoVs.\n Nine were alpha (?)-CoVs; four were ?-CoVs.\n Twelve were novel.\n Analyses of these viruses in the context of their hosts and ecological habitat indicated that host species is a strong selective driver in CoV evolution, even in allopatric populations separated by significant geographical distance; and that a single species/genus of bat can contain multiple CoVs.\n A ?-CoV with 96.5?% amino acid identity to the ?-CoV associated with human disease in the Middle East was found in a Nyctinomops laticaudatus bat, suggesting that efforts to identify the viral reservoir should include surveillance of the bat families Molossidae/Vespertilionidae, or the closely related Nycteridae/Emballonuridae.\n While it is important to investigate unknown viral diversity in bats, it is also important to remember that the majority of viruses they carry will not pose any clinical risk, and bats should not be stigmatized ubiquitously as significant threats to public health.\n","id":"PMC3709589","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"S.

We also compare S proteins of SARS-CoV isolated during the 2002–2003 SARS outbreak and during the much less severe 2003–2004 outbreak, and from palm civets, a possible source of SARS-CoV found in humans.\n All three S proteins bound to and utilized palm-civet ACE2 efficiently, but the latter two S proteins utilized human ACE2 markedly less efficiently than did the S protein obtained during the earlier human outbreak.\n The lower affinity of these S proteins could be complemented by altering specific residues within the S-protein-binding site of human ACE2 to those of civet ACE2, or by altering S-protein residues 479 and 487 to residues conserved during the 2002–2003 outbreak.\n Collectively, these data describe molecular interactions important to the adaptation of SARS-CoV to human cells, and provide insight into the severity of the 2002–2003 SARS epidemic.\n","id":"PMC1142572","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Wenhui","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chengsheng","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jianhua","surname":"Sui","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jens H","surname":"Kuhn","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Michael J","surname":"Moore","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shiwen","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Swee-Kee","surname":"Wong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"I-Chueh","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Keming","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Natalya","surname":"Vasilieva","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Akikazu","surname":"Murakami","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yaqing","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wayne A","surname":"Marasco","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hyeryun","surname":"Choe","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Michael","surname":"Farzan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1128/JVI.02219-09","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Ecoepidemiology and complete genome comparison of different strains of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related Rhinolophus bat coronavirus in China reveal bats as a reservoir for acute, self-limiting infection that allows recombination events","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1128/JVI.01121-10","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Coexistence of different genotypes in the same bat and serological characterization of Rousettus bat coronavirus HKU9 belonging to a novel Betacoronavirus subgroup","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1073/pnas.0409608102","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Cross-host evolution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus in palm civet and human","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.3201/eid1911.131172","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus in Bats, Saudi Arabia","abstract":"The source of human infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus remains unknown.\n Molecular investigation indicated that bats in Saudi Arabia are infected with several alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses.\n Virus from 1 bat showed 100% nucleotide identity to virus from the human index case-patient.\n Bats might play a role in human infection.\n","id":"PMC3837665","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ziad A.","surname":"Memish","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nischay","surname":"Mishra","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kevin J.","surname":"Olival","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shamsudeen F.","surname":"Fagbo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Vishal","surname":"Kapoor","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jonathan H.","surname":"Epstein","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rafat","surname":"AlHakeem","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Abdulkareem","surname":"Durosinloun","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mushabab","surname":"Al Asmari","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ariful","surname":"Islam","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Amit","surname":"Kapoor","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Thomas","surname":"Briese","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peter","surname":"Daszak","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Abdullah A.","surname":"Al Rabeeah","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"W.

coronavirus 2019?nCoV","abstract":"The current outbreak of viral pneumonia in the city of Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel coronavirus designated 2019?nCoV by the World Health Organization, as determined by sequencing the viral RNA genome.\n Many initial patients were exposed to wildlife animals at the Huanan seafood wholesale market, where poultry, snake, bats, and other farm animals were also sold.\n To investigate possible virus reservoir, we have carried out comprehensive sequence analysis and comparison in conjunction with relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) bias among different animal species based on the 2019?nCoV sequence.\n Results obtained from our analyses suggest that the 2019?nCoV may appear to be a recombinant virus between the bat coronavirus and an origin?unknown coronavirus.\n The recombination may occurred within the viral spike glycoprotein, which recognizes a cell surface receptor.\n Additionally, our findings suggest that 2019?nCoV has most similar

binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development

associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

from 21 MERS cases of which 13 had 100%, four 85–95%, and four 30–50% genome coverage.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of the 21 sequences, combined with nine published MERS-CoV genomes, was

coronaviruses provides new insights into the origin of SARS coronavirus","abstract":"A large number of SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoV) have been detected in horseshoe bats since 2005 in different areas of China.\n However, these bat SARSr-CoVs show sequence differences from SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in different genes (S, ORF8, ORF3, etc) and are considered unlikely to represent the direct progenitor of SARS-CoV.\n Herein, we report the findings of our 5-year surveillance of SARSr-CoVs in a cave inhabited by multiple species of horseshoe bats in Yunnan Province, China.\n The full-length genomes of 11 newly discovered SARSr-CoV strains, together with our previous findings, reveals that the SARSr-CoVs circulating in this single location are highly diverse in the S gene, ORF3 and ORF8. Importantly, strains with high genetic similarity to SARS-CoV in the hypervariable N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 gene, the ORF3 and ORF8 region, respectively, were all discovered in this cave.\n In addition, we report the first discovery of bat SARSr-CoVs highly similar to human SARS-CoV in ORF3b and in the split ORF8a and 8b.\n Moreover, SARSr-CoV strains from this cave were more closely related to SARS-CoV in the non-structural protein genes ORF1a and 1b compared with those detected elsewhere.\n Recombination analysis shows evidence of frequent recombination events within the S gene and around the ORF8 between these SARSr-CoVs.\n We hypothesize that the direct progenitor of SARS-CoV may have originated after sequential recombination events between the precursors of these SARSr-CoVs.\n Cell entry studies demonstrated that three newly identified SARSr-CoVs with different S protein sequences are all able to use human ACE2 as the receptor, further exhibiting the close relationship between strains in this cave and SARS-CoV.\n This work provides new insights into the origin and evolution of SARS-CoV and highlights the necessity of preparedness for future emergence of SARS-like diseases.\n","id":"PMC5708621","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ben","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei-Ping","surname":"Zeng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xing-Lou","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xing-Yi","surname":"Ge","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bei","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jia-Zheng","surname":"Xie","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xu-Rui","surname":"Shen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yun-Zhi","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ning","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dong-Sheng","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiao-Shuang","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Mei-Niang","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peter","surname":"Daszak","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin-Fa","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lin-Fa","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jie","surname":"Cui","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng-Li","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng-Li","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christian","surname":"Drosten","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christian","surname":"Drosten","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christian","surname":"Drosten","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"NULL","surname":"NULL","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1128/JVI.06882-11","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Evidence for a common evolutionary origin of coronavirus spike protein receptor-binding subunits","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1126/science.1116480","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Structure of SARS coronavirus spike receptor-binding domain complexed with receptor","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00255","date":"1970-01-01","title":"ff14SB: improving the accuracy of protein side chain and backbone parameters from ff99SB","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1038/nature12005","date":"2013-02-13","title":"Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 is a functional receptor for the emerging human coronavirus-EMC","abstract":"Supplementary information\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1038/nature12005) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7095326","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"V.

Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis

January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

outcomes in patients with a number of different malignancies.\n\n The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between NLR and mortality in a population of adult critically ill patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe performed an observational cohort study of unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on records in a large clinical database.\n\n We computed individual patient NLR and categorized patients by quartile of this ratio.\n\n The association of NLR quartiles and 28-day mortality was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n Secondary outcomes included mortality in the ICU, in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality.\n\n An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with versus without sepsis was performed to assess any differences in the relationship between the NLR and outcomes in these cohorts.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 5,056 patients were included.\n\n Their 28-day mortality rate was 19%.\n\n The median age of the cohort was 65 years, and 47% were female.\n\n The median NLR for the entire cohort was 8.9 (interquartile range, 4.99 to 16.21).\n\n Following multivariable adjustments, there was a stepwise increase in mortality with increasing quartiles of NLR (first quartile: reference category; second quartile odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.71; third quartile OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.83; 4th quartile OR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.16).\n\n A similar stepwise relationship was identified in the subgroup of patients who presented without sepsis.\n\n The NLR was not associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis.\n\n Increasing quartile of NLR was statistically significantly associated with secondary outcome.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe NLR is associated with outcomes in unselected critically ill patients.\n\n In patients with sepsis, there was no statistically significant relationship between NLR and mortality.\n\n Further investigation is required to increase understanding of the

the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough.\n Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of

associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

syndrome and, among them, 11 (11%) patients worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection was of clustering onset, is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n In general, characteristics of patients who died were in line with the MuLBSTA score, an early warning model for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia.\n\n Further investigation is needed to explore the applicability of the MuLBSTA score in predicting the risk of mortality in 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key R&amp;D Program of

coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing Municipal Science and Technology
