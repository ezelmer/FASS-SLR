barrier to widespread testing has been a paucity of traditional respiratory viral swab collection kits relative to the demand.\n\n Whether other sample collection kits, such as widely available MRSA nasal swabs can be used to detect SARS-CoV-2 is unknown.\n\n\nMethods\nWe compared simultaneous nasal MRSA swabs (COPAN ESwabs ® 480C flocked nasal swab in 1mL of liquid Amies medium) and virals wabs (BD H192(07) flexible mini-tip flocked nasopharyngeal swabs in 3mL Universal Transport Medium) for SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing using Simplexa COVID-19 Direct assay on patients over a 4-day period.\n\n When the results were discordant, the viral swab sample was run again on the Cepheid Xpert Xpress ® SARS-CoV-2 assay.\n\n\nResults\nOf the 81 included samples, there were 19 positives and 62 negatives in viral media and 18 positives and 63 negative in the MRSA swabs.\n\n Amongst all included samples, there was concordance between the COPAN ESwabs ® 480C and the viral swabs in 78

(MERS)-CoV, have raised great public health concern globally.\n\n Here, we report a novel bat-origin CoV causing severe and fatal pneumonia in humans.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected clinical data and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens from five patients with severe pneumonia from Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, Hubei province, China.\n\n Nucleic acids of the BAL were extracted and subjected to next-generation sequencing.\n\n Virus isolation was carried out, and maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees were constructed.\n\n\nResults\nFive patients hospitalized from December 18 to December 29, 2019 presented with fever, cough, and dyspnea accompanied by complications of acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n Chest radiography revealed diffuse opacities and consolidation.\n\n One of these patients died.\n\n Sequence results revealed the presence of a previously unknown ?-CoV strain in all five patients, with 99.8% to 99.9% nucleotide identities among the isolates.\n\n These isolates showed 79.0% nucleotide identity with the sequence of SARS-CoV (GenBank NC_004718) and 51.8% identity with the sequence of MERS-CoV (GenBank NC_019843).\n\n The virus is phylogenetically closest to a bat SARS-like CoV (SL-ZC45, GenBank MG772933) with 87.6% to 87.7% nucleotide identity, but is in a separate clade.\n\n Moreover, these viruses have a single intact open reading frame gene 8, as a

binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development

familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China,

attention, probably because suitable detection methods have been lacking.\n Between November 2004 and October 2006, the presence of 14 respiratory viruses in children aged less than 3 years old with community?acquired pneumonia were investigated using molecular or immunochromatographic techniques and/or viral culture.\n A total of 315 children (338 episodes) were included, and hospitalization was required in 178 episodes.\n At least one virus was detected in 66.9% of the episodes and simultaneous detection of two or more viruses was frequent (27% of the episodes with viral detection).\n The most frequently detected virus was respiratory syncytial virus (n?=?67: 33 subgroup A, 33 subgroup B, 1 not typed), followed by human bocavirus (n?=?48), rhinovirus (n?=?46), human metapneumovirus (n?=?39: 13 genotype A2, 8 B1, 5 B2, 1 A1, 12 not genotyped) and parainfluenza viruses (n?=?38: 1 type 1, 3 type 2, 22 type 3, 11 type 4 and 1 not typed).\n The 14 viruses investigated were found in viral coinfections, which were more frequent in children aged less than 12 months.\n Except for adenovirus, the incidence of which was low, the percentage of viral coinfection ranged between 28.2% and 68.8%.\n Children with viral coinfection more frequently required hospital admission than those with single viral infection.\n It is concluded that viral coinfections are frequent in children aged less than 3 years old with community?acquired pneumonia and can be a poor prognostic factor.\n J.\n Med.\n Virol.\n 80:1843–1849, 2008. © 2008 Wiley?Liss,

Nasopharyngeal aspirates from 150 of the 322 infants (46.6%) tested positive for at least one pathogen.\n Ninety samples (28.0%) tested positive for RSV RNA (61.5% genotype A and 38.5% genotype B), 46 (14.3%) for hMPV RNA (71.7% subtype A and 28.3% subtype B), 28 (8.7%) for hCoV RNA (39.3% hCoV?OC43, 35.7% hCoV?NL63, 21.4% hCoV?HKU1, and 3.6% hCoV?229E), and 7 (2.2%) for hBoV DNA (of the 6 typed,

immunofluorescence assay (DFA) and HuH7 cell culture for the detection of viruses in 263 children admitted to hospital with an acute respiratory illness.\n One hundred fifty (57.6%) nasal aspirates were found DFA?positive; 188 (72.3%) were found positive by both DFA and HuH7 cell culture, and 242 (92%) were PCR?positive.\n The m?PCR detected 124 viruses which were not found by conventional methods: 68 rhinovirus, 17 human metapneumovirus, 15 respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), 8 parainfluenza virus (PIV), 5 coronavirus 229E, 3 OC43 and 3 NL63, 4 enterovirus, 2 influenza virus B and C virus.\n The m?PCR were more sensitive, had the advantages of a shorter delay in specific diagnosis, and a lower cost than DFA and culture.\n Using these m?PCR, the prevalence of each virus was compared between in?patient and out?patient groups of children attending the emergency unit of the hospital.\n Nasal aspirates from 411 (91.5%) children were found positive by the PCRs.\n RSV, rhinovirus, and influenza virus were the most frequent viruses detected in this population, representing 43.6%, 31.8%, and 8.8% of the virus found, respectively, followed by human metapneumovirus (4.4%), coronavirus (3.4%), parainfluenza virus (3.2%), adenovirus (2.3%), and enterovirus (2.1%).\n RSVs were detected more significantly in the in?patient group than in the out?patient group, and influenza viruses were detected more frequently in the out?patient group than in the in?patient group.\n Moreover, the use of m?PCR pointed out the frequency of rhinovirus and mixed viral detections in these patients.\n In conclusion, according to the requirements of speed and low cost of the methods, and to achieve the highest rate of detection of respiratory viruses, the combined use of DFA and m?PCR is today likely to be the best way to improve diagnosis of respiratory illnesses in children.\n J.\n Med.\n Virol.\n 78:1498–1504, 2006. © 2006 Wiley?Liss,

disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).\n\n Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (?18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.\n\n\nFindings\n191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital.\n\n 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients).\n\n Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·03–1·17, per year increase; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·61–12·23; p&lt;0·0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL (18·42, 2·64–128·55; p=0·0033) on admission.\n\n Median duration of viral shedding was 20·0 days (IQR 17·0–24·0) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors.\n\n The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage.\n\n Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.\n\n\nFunding\nChinese Academy of Medical Sciences Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences; National Science Grant for Distinguished Young Scholars; National Key

characterisation and epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and

(COVID-19) in Jiangsu Province.\n\n\nMethods\nWe retrospectively investigated the clinical, imaging, and laboratory characteristics of confirmed cases of COVID-19 with WHO interim guidance in three Grade ?A hospitals of Jiangsu from Jan 22 to Feb 14, 2020. Real time RT-PCR was used to detect the new coronavirus in respiratory samples.\n\n\nResults\nOf the 80 patients infected with COVID-19, 41 patients were female, with a median age of 46.1 years.\n\n Except for 3 severe patients, the rest of the 77 patients exhibited mild or moderate symptoms.\n\n 9 patients were unconfirmed until a third-time nucleic acid test.\n\n 38 cases had a history of chronic diseases.\n\n The main clinical manifestations of the patients were fever and cough, which accounted for 63 cases (78.75%) and 51 cases (-63.75%) respectively.\n\n Only 3 patients (3.75%) showed liver dysfunction.\n\n Imaging examination showed that 55 patients (-68.75%) showed abnormal, 25 cases (31.25%) had no abnormal density shadow in the parenchyma of both lungs.\n\n Up to now, 21

The route of transmission was by close contact with family members (32 [89%]) or a history of exposure to the epidemic area (12 [33%]); eight (22%) patients had both exposures.\n\n 19 (53%) patients had moderate clinical type with pneumonia; 17 (47%) had mild clinical type and either were asymptomatic (ten [28%]) or had acute upper respiratory symptoms (seven [19%]).\n\n Common symptoms on admission were fever (13 [36%]) and dry cough (seven [19%]).\n\n Of those with fever, four (11%) had a body temperature of 38·5°C or higher, and nine (25%) had a body temperature of 37·5–38·5°C.\n\n Typical abnormal laboratory findings were elevated creatine kinase MB (11 [31%]), decreased lymphocytes (11 [31%]), leucopenia (seven [19%]), and elevated procalcitonin (six [17%]).\n\n Besides radiographic presentations, variables that were associated significantly with severity of COVID-19 were decreased lymphocytes, elevated body temperature, and high levels of procalcitonin, D-dimer, and creatine kinase MB.\n\n All children received interferon alfa by aerosolisation twice a day, 14 (39%) received lopinavir–ritonavir syrup twice a day, and six (17%) needed oxygen inhalation.\n\n Mean time in hospital was 14 (SD 3) days.\n\n By Feb 28, 2020, all patients were cured.\n\n\nInterpretation\nAlthough all paediatric patients in our cohort had mild or moderate type of COVID-19, the large proportion of asymptomatic children indicates the difficulty in identifying paediatric patients who do not have clear epidemiological information, leading to a dangerous situation in

infants during primary respiratory illness, investigate the sensitivity of nasal swabs and nasopharyngeal aspirates, and assess whether patient characteristics and viral load played a role in the sensitivity.\n Healthy infants were included at signs of first respiratory tract infection.\n Paired nasopharyngeal aspirates and nasal swabs were collected.\n Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out for 11 respiratory pathogens.\n Paired nasopharyngeal aspirates and nasal swabs were collected in 98 infants.\n Rhinovirus (n?=?67) and respiratory syncytial virus (n?=?39) were the most frequently detected.\n Co-infection occurred in 48% (n?=?45) of the infants.\n The sensitivity of the nasal swab was lower than the nasopharyngeal aspirate, in particular, for respiratory syncytial virus (51% vs.\n 100%) and rhinovirus (75% vs.\n 97%).\n The sensitivity of the nasal swab was strongly determined by the cycle threshold (CT) value (p?&lt;?0.001).\n The sensitivity of the swab for respiratory syncytial virus, but not rhinovirus, was 100% in children with severe symptoms (score ?11).\n It is concluded that, for community-based studies and surveillance purposes, the

is highly infectious agent that causes fatal respiratory illnesses, which is of great global public health concern.\n Currently, there is no effective vaccine for tackling this COVID19 pandemic where disease countermeasures rely upon preventing or slowing person-to-person transmission.\n Specifically, there is increasing efforts to prevent or reduce transmission to front-line healthcare workers (HCW).\n However, there is growing international concern regarding the shortage in supply chain of critical one-time-use personal and protective equipment (PPE).\n PPE are heat sensitive and are not, by their manufacturer's design, intended for reprocessing.\n Most conventional sterilization technologies used in hospitals, or in terminal medical device sterilization providers, cannot effectively reprocess PPE due to the nature and severity of sterilization modalities.\n Contingency planning for PPE stock shortage is important.\n Solutions in the Republic of Ireland include use of smart communication channels to improve supply chain, bespoke production of PPE to meets gaps, along with least preferred option, use of sterilization or high-level disinfection for PPE reprocessing.\n Reprocessing PPE must consider material composition, functionality post treatment, along with appropriate disinfection.\n Following original manufacturer of PPE and regulatory guidance is important.\n Technologies deployed in the US, and for deployment in the Republic of Ireland, are eco-friendly, namely vaporised hydrogen peroxide (VH2O2), such as for filtering facepiece respirators and UV irradiation and High-level liquid disinfection (Actichlor+) is also been pursed in Ireland.\n Safeguarding supply chain of PPE will sustain vital healthcare provision and will help reduce

Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.\n\n (Funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7121484","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Qun","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuhua","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoye","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yeqing","surname":"Tong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ruiqi","surname":"Ren","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kathy S.M.","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Eric H.Y.","surname":"Lau","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jessica Y.","surname":"Wong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuesen","surname":"Xing","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nijuan","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chao","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tian","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jing","surname":"Zhao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Man","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wenxiao","surname":"Tu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chuding","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lianmei","surname":"Jin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rui","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Qi","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Suhua","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rui","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yinbo","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ge","surname":"Shao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhongfa","surname":"Tao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yang","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhiqiang","surname":"Deng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Boxi","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhitao","surname":"Ma","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yanping","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guoqing","surname":"Shi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tommy T.Y.","surname":"Lam","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Joseph T.","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"George F.","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Benjamin J.","surname":"Cowling","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gabriel M.","surname":"Leung","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zijian","surname":"Feng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Terminal sterilization of medical devices using vaporized hydrogen peroxide: a review of current methods and emerging opportunities","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.3201/eid0505.990507","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The economic impact of pandemic influenza in the United States: priorities for intervention.","abstract":"We estimated the possible effects of the next influenza pandemic in the United States and analyzed the economic impact of vaccine-based interventions.\n Using death rates, hospitalization data, and outpatient visits, we estimated 89,000 to 207,000 deaths;

species barrier and infect humans.\n\n A renewed interest in coronaviral research has led to the discovery of several novel human CoVs and since then much progress has been made in understanding the CoV life cycle.\n\n The CoV envelope (E) protein is a small, integral membrane protein involved in several aspects of the virus’ life cycle, such as assembly, budding, envelope formation, and pathogenesis.\n\n Recent studies have expanded on its structural motifs and topology, its functions as an ion-channelling viroporin, and its interactions with both other CoV proteins and host cell proteins.\n\n\nMain body\nid='Par2'>This review aims to establish the current knowledge on CoV E by highlighting the recent progress that has been made and comparing it to previous knowledge.\n\n It also compares E to other viral proteins of a similar nature to speculate the relevance of these new findings.\n\n Good progress has been made but much still remains unknown and this review has identified some gaps in the current knowledge and made suggestions for consideration in future research.\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par3'>The most progress has been made on SARS-CoV E, highlighting specific structural requirements for its functions in the CoV life cycle as well as mechanisms behind its pathogenesis.\n\n Data shows that E is involved in critical aspects of the viral life cycle and that CoVs lacking E make promising vaccine candidates.\n\n The high mortality rate of certain CoVs, along with their ease of transmission, underpins the need for more research into CoV molecular biology which can aid in the production of effective anti-coronaviral agents for both human CoVs and enzootic CoVs.\n\n\n","id":"PMC6537279","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Dewald","surname":"Schoeman","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Burtram

rapid spread over many healthcare systems throughout the world has led to a shortage in personal protective equipment (PPE), which cannot be solved by reducing their use or by increasing production.\n\n It is thus necessary to promote PPE rational use, highlighting possible differences in terms of efficacy and promoting an effective technique to reuse them.\n\n\nMethods\nA literature search was performed on PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane database, and Google Scholar, and from the 25 top cited articles, 15 were selected for relevance and impact.\n\n\nResults\nMost studies on previous respiratory virus epidemics to date suggest surgical masks are not inferior compared with N95 respirators in terms of protective efficacy among healthcare workers.\n\n Therefore, the use of N95 respirators should be limited to high-risk situations.\n\n Concerning respirator reuse, highly energetic, short-wave, ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) at 254 nm was determined to decontaminate N95 respirators from viral respiratory agents, but UVGI requires careful consideration of the type of respirator and of the biologic target.\n\n\nConclusions\nRational use and successful reuse of respirators can help in the shortage of PPE during a pandemic.\n\n Further studies testing UVGI and other decontamination techniques are an unmet need.\n\n The definitive answer to pandemic issues can be found in artificial intelligence and deep learning.\n\n These groundbreaking modalities could help in identifying high-risk patients and in suggesting appropriate types and use of PPE.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7184993","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ivo","surname":"Boškoski","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Camilla","surname":"Gallo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Michael

sweeps across the world, the availability of viral transport medium (VTM) has become severely limited, contributing to delays in diagnosis and rationing of diagnostic testing.\n Given that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral RNA has demonstrated stability, we posited that phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) may be a viable transport medium, as an alternative to VTM, for clinical real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) testing.\n The intra-individual reliability and interindividual reliability of SARS-CoV-2 qPCR were assessed in clinical endotracheal secretion samples transported in VTM or PBS to evaluate the stability of the qPCR signal for three viral targets (N gene, ORF1ab, and S gene) when samples were stored in these media at room temperature for up to 18 hours.\n We report that the use of PBS as a transport medium allows high intra-individual and interindividual reliability, maintains viral stability, and compares with VTM in the detection of the three SARS-CoV-2 genes through 18 hours of storage.\n This study establishes PBS as a clinically useful medium that can be readily deployed for transporting and short-term preservation of specimens containing SARS-CoV-2. Use of PBS as a transport medium has the potential to increase testing capacity for SARS-CoV-2, aiding more widespread screening and early diagnosis of

associated with human to human transmission and severe human infection has been recently reported from the city of Wuhan in China.\n\n Our objectives were to characterize the genetic relationships of the 2019-nCoV and to search for putative recombination within the subgenus of sarbecovirus.\n\n\nMethods\nPutative recombination was investigated by RDP4 and Simplot v3.5.1 and discordant phylogenetic clustering in individual genomic fragments was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods.\n\n\nResults\nOur analysis suggests that the 2019-nCoV although closely related to BatCoV RaTG13 sequence throughout the genome (sequence similarity 96.3%), shows discordant clustering with the Bat_SARS-like coronavirus sequences.\n\n Specifically, in the 5?-part spanning the first 11,498 nucleotides and the last 3?-part spanning 24,341–30,696 positions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 formed a single cluster with Bat_SARS-like coronavirus sequences, whereas in the middle region spanning the 3?-end of ORF1a, the ORF1b and almost half of the spike regions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 grouped in a separate distant lineage within the sarbecovirus branch.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe levels of genetic similarity between the 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 suggest that the latter does not provide the exact variant that caused the outbreak in humans, but the hypothesis that 2019-nCoV has originated from bats is very likely.\n\n We show evidence that the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) is not-mosaic consisting in almost half of its genome of a distinct lineage within the betacoronavirus.\n\n These

Findings\nid='Par2'>The basic control strategy falls into two well established categories: active attack (control) or organized defense (mitigation).\n\n The control strategy relies on classic testing, tracing, and tracking possible cases of COVID-19. Those actions draw from classical epidemiology: to actively find and detect cases, isolate if positive for 10 days and treat when needed.\n\n At the same time, the search for close contacts, test them when needed and quarantine and monitor for 10 to 14 days in order to break chains of transmission.\n\n The mitigation strategy include basic measures to protect people at increased risk of severe illness, like social distancing, wearing a mask when social distancing is not possible, avoiding crowds, avoiding indoor crowded spaces, increase ventilation indoors and washing or sanitizing hands often.\n\n They include also targeted restrictions in people’s mobility, and lock-downs, widely used during the first wave in order to spare the health system, become overwhelmed and increasingly used

laboratories as virus isolates are unavailable while there is growing evidence that the outbreak is more widespread than initially thought, and international spread through travellers does already

validated diagnostic workflow for 2019-nCoV, its design relying on close genetic relatedness of 2019-nCoV with SARS coronavirus, making use of synthetic nucleic acid technology.\n\n\nResults\nThe

Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.

characterisation and epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and

However, the “gold standard” test pioneered by the U.\nS.\n Centers for Disease Control and Prevention takes several hours to complete and requires extensive human labor, materials such as RNA extraction kits that could become in short supply, and relatively scarce qPCR machines.\n It is clear that a huge effort needs to be made to scale up current COVID-19 testing by orders of magnitude.\n There is thus a pressing need to evaluate alternative protocols, reagents, and approaches to allow nucleic-acid testing to continue in the face of these potential shortages.\n There has been a tremendous explosion in the number of papers written within the first weeks of the pandemic evaluating potential advances, comparable reagents, and alternatives to the “gold-standard” CDC RT-PCR test.\n Here we present a collection of these recent advances in COVID-19 nucleic acid testing, including both peer-reviewed and preprint articles.\n Due to the rapid developments during this crisis, we have included as many publications as possible, but many of the cited sources have not yet been peer-reviewed, so we urge researchers to further validate results in their own laboratories.\n We hope that this review can urgently consolidate and disseminate information to aid researchers in designing and implementing optimized COVID-19 testing protocols to increase the availability, accuracy, and speed of widespread COVID-19 testing.\n","id":"PMC7297120","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Meagan N.","surname":"Esbin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Oscar N.","surname":"Whitney","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Oscar N.","surname":"Whitney","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shasha","surname":"Chong","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Anna","surname":"Maurer","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xavier","surname":"Darzacq","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Robert","surname":"Tjian","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1128/JCM.00913-20","date":"2020-05-12","title":"Large-Scale, In-House Production of Viral Transport Media To Support SARS-CoV-2 PCR Testing in a Multihospital Health Care Network during the COVID-19 Pandemic","abstract":"The COVID-19 pandemic has severely disrupted worldwide supplies of viral transport media (VTM) due to widespread demand for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) testing.\n In response to this ongoing shortage, we began production of VTM in-house in support of diagnostic testing in our hospital network.\n As our diagnostic laboratory was not equipped for reagent production, we took advantage of space and personnel that became available due to closure of the research division of our medical center.\n","id":"PMC7383539","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Kenneth P.","surname":"Smith","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Annie","surname":"Cheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Amber","surname":"Chopelas","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sarah","surname":"DuBois-Coyne","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ikram","surname":"Mezghani","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shade","surname":"Rodriguez","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mustafa","surname":"Talay","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"James E.","surname":"Kirby","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Michael J.","surname":"Loeffelholz","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Michael J.","surname":"Loeffelholz","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1001/jama.2020.1623","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Epidemiologic and Clinical Characteristics of Novel Coronavirus Infections Involving 13 Patients Outside Wuhan, China","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30211-7","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study","abstract":"Background\nIn December, 2019, a pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China.\n\n We aimed to further clarify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data.\n\n Outcomes were followed up until Jan 25, 2020.\nFindings\nOf the 99 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, 49 (49%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market.\n\n The average age of the patients was 55·5 years (SD 13·1), including 67 men and 32 women.\n\n 2019-nCoV was detected in all patients by real-time RT-PCR.\n\n 50 (51%) patients had chronic diseases.\n\n Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (82 [83%] patients), cough (81 [82%] patients), shortness of breath (31 [31%] patients), muscle ache (11 [11%] patients), confusion (nine [9%] patients), headache (eight [8%] patients), sore throat (five [5%] patients), rhinorrhoea (four [4%] patients), chest pain (two [2%] patients), diarrhoea (two [2%] patients), and nausea and vomiting (one [1%] patient).\n\n According to imaging examination, 74 (75%) patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 14 (14%) patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity, and one (1%) patient had pneumothorax.\n\n 17 (17%) patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and, among them, 11 (11%) patients worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection was of clustering onset, is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n In general, characteristics of patients who died were in line with the MuLBSTA score, an early warning model for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia.\n\n Further investigation is needed to explore the applicability of the MuLBSTA score in predicting the risk of mortality in 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key R&amp;D Program of

data.\n\n\nMethods\nSalivary samples of 25 COVID-19 patients were analyzed by rRT-PCR.\n\n The following data were collected: age, sex, comorbidities, drugs.\n\n Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and ultrasensitive reactive C protein (usRCP) values were registered on the same day when a salivary swab was collected.\n\n Prevalence of positivity in saliva and association between clinical data and the cycle threshold as a semiquantitative indicator of viral load were considered.\n\n\nResults\nTwenty-five subjects were recruited into this study, 17 males and 8 females.\n\n The mean age was 61.5 +/? 11.2 years.\n\n Cardiovascular and/or dysmetabolic disorders were observed in 65.22% of cases.\n\n All the samples tested positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2, while there was an inverse

profiles of viral load in posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples and serum antibody responses during infection by SARS-CoV-2: an observational cohort study","abstract":"Background\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes severe community and nosocomial outbreaks.\n\n Comprehensive data for serial respiratory viral load and serum antibody responses from patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are not yet available.\n\n Nasopharyngeal and throat swabs are usually obtained for serial viral load monitoring of respiratory infections but gathering these specimens can cause discomfort for patients and put health-care workers at risk.\n\n We aimed to ascertain the serial respiratory viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in posterior oropharyngeal (deep throat) saliva samples from patients with COVID-19, and serum antibody responses.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did a cohort study at two hospitals in Hong Kong.\n\n We included patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. We obtained samples of blood, urine, posterior oropharyngeal saliva, and rectal swabs.\n\n Serial viral load was ascertained by reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR).\n\n Antibody levels against the SARS-CoV-2 internal nucleoprotein (NP) and surface spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) were measured using EIA.\n\n Whole-genome sequencing was done to identify possible mutations arising during infection.\n\n\nFindings\nBetween Jan 22, 2020, and Feb 12, 2020, 30 patients were screened for inclusion, of whom 23 were included (median age 62 years [range 37–75]).\n\n The median viral load in posterior oropharyngeal saliva or other respiratory specimens at presentation was 5·2 log10 copies per mL (IQR 4·1–7·0).\n\n Salivary viral load was highest during the first week after symptom onset and subsequently declined with time (slope ?0·15, 95% CI ?0·19 to ?0·11; R2=0·71).\n\n In one patient, viral RNA was detected 25 days after symptom onset.\n\n Older age was correlated with higher viral load (Spearman's ?=0·48, 95% CI 0·074–0·75; p=0·020).\n\n For 16 patients with serum samples available 14 days or longer after symptom onset, rates of seropositivity were 94% for anti-NP IgG (n=15), 88% for anti-NP IgM (n=14), 100% for anti-RBD IgG (n=16), and 94% for anti-RBD IgM (n=15).\n\n Anti-SARS-CoV-2-NP or anti-SARS-CoV-2-RBD IgG levels correlated with virus neutralisation titre (R2&gt;0·9).\n\n No genome mutations were detected on serial samples.\n\n\nInterpretation\nPosterior oropharyngeal saliva samples are a non-invasive specimen more acceptable to patients and health-care workers.\n\n Unlike severe acute respiratory syndrome, patients with COVID-19 had the highest viral load near presentation, which could account for the fast-spreading nature of this epidemic.\n\n This finding emphasises the importance of stringent infection control and early use of potent antiviral agents, alone or in combination, for high-risk individuals.\n\n Serological assay can complement RT-qPCR for diagnosis.\n\n\nFunding\nRichard and Carol Yu, May Tam Mak Mei Yin, The Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Tong, Marina Lee, Government Consultancy

(COVID-19) is the third documented spillover of an animal coronavirus to humans in only two decades that has resulted in a major epidemic.\n The Coronaviridae Study Group (CSG) of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, which is responsible for developing the classification of viruses and taxon nomenclature of the family Coronaviridae, has assessed the placement of the human pathogen, tentatively named 2019-nCoV, within the Coronaviridae.\n Based on phylogeny, taxonomy and established practice, the CSG recognizes this virus as forming a sister clade to the prototype human and bat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs) of the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, and designates it as SARS-CoV-2. In order to facilitate communication, the CSG proposes to use the following naming convention for individual isolates: SARS-CoV-2/host/location/isolate/date.\n While the full spectrum of clinical manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections in humans remains to be determined, the independent zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 highlights the need for studying viruses at the species level to complement research focused on individual pathogenic viruses of immediate significance.\n This will improve our understanding of virus–host interactions in an ever-changing environment and enhance our preparedness for future outbreaks.\n","id":"PMC7095448","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Alexander E.","surname":"Gorbalenya","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Susan C.","surname":"Baker","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ralph S.","surname":"Baric","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Raoul J.","surname":"de Groot","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christian","surname":"Drosten","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Anastasia A.","surname":"Gulyaeva","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bart L.","surname":"Haagmans","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chris","surname":"Lauber","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Andrey M.","surname":"Leontovich","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Benjamin W.","surname":"Neuman","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Dmitry","surname":"Penzar","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Stanley","surname":"Perlman","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Leo L.

SARS-CoV-2 Infections and Transmission in a Skilled Nursing Facility","abstract":"Background\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can spread rapidly within skilled nursing facilities.\n\n After identification of a case of Covid-19 in a skilled nursing facility, we assessed transmission and evaluated the adequacy of symptom-based screening to identify infections in residents.\n\n\nMethods\nWe conducted two serial point-prevalence surveys, 1 week apart, in which assenting residents of the facility underwent nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal testing for SARS-CoV-2, including real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), viral culture, and sequencing.\n\n Symptoms that had been present during the preceding 14 days were recorded.\n\n Asymptomatic residents who tested positive were reassessed 7 days later.\n\n Residents with SARS-CoV-2 infection were categorized as symptomatic with typical symptoms (fever, cough, or shortness of breath), symptomatic with only atypical symptoms, presymptomatic, or asymptomatic.\n\n\nResults\nTwenty-three days after the first positive test result in a resident at this skilled nursing facility, 57 of 89 residents (64%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Among 76 residents who participated in point-prevalence surveys, 48 (63%) tested positive.\n\n Of these 48 residents, 27 (56%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing; 24 subsequently developed symptoms (median time to onset, 4 days).\n\n Samples from these 24 presymptomatic residents had a median rRT-PCR cycle threshold value of 23.1, and viable virus was recovered from 17 residents.\n\n As of April 3, of the 57 residents with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 11 had been hospitalized (3 in the intensive care unit) and 15 had died (mortality, 26%).\n\n Of the 34 residents whose specimens were sequenced, 27 (79%) had sequences that fit into two clusters with a difference of one nucleotide.\n\n\nConclusions\nRapid and widespread transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was demonstrated in this skilled nursing facility.\n\n More than half of residents with positive test results were asymptomatic at the time of testing and most likely contributed to transmission.\n\n Infection-control strategies focused solely on symptomatic residents were not sufficient to prevent transmission after SARS-CoV-2 introduction into this facility.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7200056","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Melissa M.","surname":"Arons","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kelly

features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Background\nA recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China,

methods.\n\n\nFindings\nFever and pneumonia initially improved but 64 (85%) patients developed recurrent fever after a mean of 8.9 (SD 3.1) days, 55 (73%) had watery diarrhoea after 7.5 (2.3) days, 60 (80%) had radiological worsening after 7.4 (2.2) days, and respiratory symptoms worsened in 34 (45%) after 8.6 (3.0) days.\n\n In 34 (45%) patients, improvement of initial pulmonary lesions was associated with appearance of new radiological lesions at other sites.\n\n Nine (12%) patients developed spontaneous pneumomediastinum and 15 (20%) developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in week 3. Quantitative reverse-transcriptase (RT) PCR of nasopharyngeal aspirates in 14 patients (four with ARDS) showed peak viral load at day 10, and at day 15 a load lower than at admission.\n\n Age and chronic hepatitis B virus infection treated with lamivudine were independent significant risk factors for progression to ARDS (p=0.001).\n\n SARS-associated coronavirus in faeces was seen on RT-PCR in 65 (97%) of 67 patients at day 14. The mean time to seroconversion was 20 days.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe consistent clinical progression, shifting radiological infiltrates, and an inverted V viral-load profile suggest that worsening in

to Validate the Sufficiency of Provider-Observed, Home-Collected Blood, Saliva, and Oropharyngeal Samples","abstract":"Background\nThe response in the United States to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has been hampered by a lack of aggressive testing for the infection.\n\n Testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cornerstone of an effective public health response.\n\n However, efforts to test have been hampered by limited reagents, limitations in the availability of swabs used for the collection of nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens, limitations in personal protective equipment (PPE) for health care providers collecting the NPS specimens, and limitations in viral transport media for transporting the specimens.\n\n Therefore, more flexible options for screening for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and serologic responses are critical to inform clinical and public health responses.\n\n\nObjective\nWe aim to document the ability of patients to self-collect sufficient specimens for SARS-CoV-2 viral detection and serology.\n\n\nMethods\nPatient self-collection of samples will be done with observation by a health care provider during a telemedicine session.\n\n Participants will be mailed a specimen collection kit, engage in a telehealth session with a provider through a HIPPA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996)-compliant video meeting, and collect specimens while being observed by the provider.\n\n Providers will record whether they are confident in the suitability of the specimen for laboratory testing that would inform clinical decision making.\n\n We will objectively assess the sufficiency of biological material in the mailed-in specimens.\n\n\nResults\nThe protocol was approved by the Emory University Institutional Review Board (IRB) on March 30, 2020 (Protocol number 371).\n\n To date, we have enrolled 159 participants.\n\n\nConclusions\nDefining a conceptual framework for assessing the sufficiency of patient-collected samples for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and serologic responses to infection is critical for facilitating public health responses and providing PPE-sparing options to increase testing.\n\n Validation of alternative methods of specimen collection should include objective measures of the sufficiency of specimens for testing.\n\n A strong evidence base for diversifying testing modalities will improve tools to guide public health responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7184968","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Gunther","surname":"Eysenbach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Robin","surname":"MacGowan","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Robin","surname":"MacGowan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shelley","surname":"Facente","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Patrick

quantitative reverse transcription real time PCR assay (RT-qPCR), viral load can be measured and monitored in a few hours.\n In this context, the development, standardization and validation of a RT-qPCR test to quickly and efficiently quantify yellow fever virus (YFV) in all stages of vaccine production are extremely important.\n To serve this purpose we used a plasmid construction containing the NS5 region from 17DD YFV to generate the standard curve and to evaluate parameters such as linearity, precision and specificity against other flavivirus.\n Furthermore, we defined the limits of detection as 25 copies/reaction, and quantification as 100 copies/reaction for the test.\n To ensure the quality of the method, reference controls were established in order to avoid false negative results.\n The qRT-PCR technique based on the use of TaqMan probes herein standardized proved to be effective for determining yellow fever viral load both in vivo and in vitro, thus becoming a very important tool to assure the quality control for vaccine production and evaluation of viremia after vaccination or YF

discovered coronavirus, SARS-associated coronavirus (SARSCoV).\n\n We did clinical and experimental studies to assess the role of this virus in the cause of SARS.\n\n\nMethods\nWe tested clinical and postmortem samples from 436 SARS patients in six countries for infection with SARSCoV, human metapneumovirus, and other respiratory pathogens.\n\n We infected four cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) with SARS-CoV in an attempt to replicate SARS and did necropsies on day 6 after infection.\n\n\nFindings\nSARS-CoV infection was diagnosed in 329 (75%) of 436 patients fitting the case definition of SARS; human metapneumovirus was diagnosed in 41 (12%) of 335, and other respiratory pathogens were diagnosed only sporadically.\n\n SARS-CoV was, therefore, the most likely causal agent of SARS.\n\n The four SARS-CoV-infected macaques excreted SARS-CoV from nose, mouth, and pharynx from 2 days after infection.\n\n Three of four macaques developed diffuse alveolar damage, similar to that in SARS patients, and characterised by epithelial necrosis, serosanguineous exudate, formation of hyaline membranes, type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia, and the presence of syncytia.\n\n SARS-CoV was detected in pneumonic areas by virus isolation and RT-PCR, and was localised to alveolar epithelial cells and syncytia by immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy.\n\n\nInterpretation\nReplication in SARS-CoV-infected macaques of pneumonia similar to that in human beings with SARS, combined with the high prevalence of SARS-CoV infection in SARS patients, fulfill the criteria required to prove that SARS-CoV is the primary cause of

Influenza-Like Illness Among an Internet-Based Cohort in the UK During the 2014-2015 Flu Season: Pilot Study","abstract":"Background\nRoutine influenza surveillance, based on laboratory confirmation of viral infection, often fails to estimate the true burden of influenza-like illness (ILI) in the community because those with ILI often manage their own symptoms without visiting a health professional.\n\n Internet-based surveillance can complement this traditional surveillance by measuring symptoms and health behavior of a population with minimal time delay.\n\n Flusurvey, the UK’s largest crowd-sourced platform for surveillance of influenza, collects routine data on more than 6000 voluntary participants and offers real-time estimates of ILI circulation.\n\n However, one criticism of this method of surveillance is that it is only able to assess ILI, rather than virologically confirmed influenza.\n\n\nObjective\nWe designed a pilot study to see if it was feasible to ask individuals from the Flusurvey platform to perform a self-swabbing task and to assess whether they were able to collect samples with a suitable viral content to detect an influenza virus in the laboratory.\n\n\nMethods\nVirological swabbing kits were sent to pilot study participants, who then monitored their ILI symptoms over the influenza season (2014-2015) through the Flusurvey platform.\n\n If they reported ILI, they were asked to undertake self-swabbing and return the swabs to a Public Health England laboratory for multiplex respiratory virus polymerase chain reaction testing.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 700 swab kits were distributed at the start of the study; from these, 66 participants met the definition for ILI and were asked to return samples.\n\n In all, 51 samples were received in the laboratory, 18 of which tested positive for a viral cause of ILI (35%).\n\n\nConclusions\nThis demonstrated proof of concept that it is possible to apply self-swabbing for virological laboratory testing to an online cohort study.\n\n This pilot does not have significant numbers to validate whether Flusurvey surveillance accurately reflects influenza infection in the community, but highlights that the methodology is feasible.\n\n Self-swabbing could be expanded to larger online surveillance activities, such as during the initial stages of a pandemic, to understand community transmission or to better assess interseasonal activity.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5856931","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Gunther","surname":"Eysenbach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Heather","surname":"Miller","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Heather","surname":"Miller","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Andrew","surname":"Hayward","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Clare","surname":"Wenham","email":"c.wenham@lse.ac.uk","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Clare","surname":"Wenham","email":"c.wenham@lse.ac.uk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Eleanor

objective of this study was to estimate the disease burden associated with influenza-like illness (ILI) in the United Kingdom stratified by age, risk and influenza vaccination status.\n\n\nMethods\nThis retrospective, cross-sectional, exploratory, observational study used linked data from the General Practice Research Database and the Hospital Episode Statistics databases to estimate resource use and cost associated with ILI in the UK.\n\n\nResults\nData were included from 156,193 patients with ?1 general practitioner visit with ILI.\n\n There were 21,518 high-risk patients, of whom 12,514 (58.2%) were vaccinated and 9,004 (41.8%) were not vaccinated, and 134,675 low-risk patients, of whom 17,482 (13.0%) were vaccinated and 117,193 (87.0%) were not vaccinated.\n\n High-risk vaccinated patients were older (p&lt;0.001) and had more risk conditions (p&lt;0.001).\n\n High-risk (odds ratio [OR] 2.16) or vaccinated (OR 1.19) patients had a higher probability of &gt;1 general practitioner visit compared with low-risk and unvaccinated patients.\n\n Patients who were high-risk and vaccinated had a reduced risk of &gt;1 general practitioner visit (OR 0.82; p&lt;0.001).\n\n High-risk individuals who were also vaccinated had a lower probability of ILI-related hospitalisation than individuals who were high-risk or vaccinated alone (OR 0.59).\n\n In people aged ?65 years, the mortality rate was lower in vaccinated than unvaccinated individuals (OR 0.75).\n\n The cost of ILI-related GP visits and hospital admissions in the UK over the study period in low-risk vaccinated patients was £27,391,142 and £141,932,471, respectively.\n\n In low-risk unvaccinated patients the corresponding values were £168,318,709 and £112,534,130, respectively.\n\n\nConclusions\nAlthough vaccination rates in target groups have increased, many people are still not receiving influenza vaccination, and the burden of ILI in the United Kingdom remains substantial.\n\n Improving influenza vaccination uptake may have the potential to reduce this burden.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4546056","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Rhys

of global surveillance during an influenza pandemic","abstract":"Surveillance is an essential foundation for monitoring and evaluating any disease process, and is especially critical when new disease agents appear.\n The H1N1 influenza pandemic of 2009 tested the capacities of countries to detect, assess, notify and report events as required by the 2005 International Health Regulations (IHR).\n As detailed in the IHR, the World Health Organization drew on official reports from Member States as well as unofficial sources (e.\ng.\n media alerts) to quickly report and disseminate information about the appearance of the novel influenza virus.\n The pre-existing Global Influenza Surveillance Network for virological surveillance also provided crucial information for rapid development of a vaccine and for detection of changes in the virus.\n However, the pandemic also highlighted a number of shortcomings in global epidemiological surveillance for respiratory disease.\n These included the lack of standards for reporting illness, risk factor and mortality data, and a mechanism for systematic reporting of epidemiological data.\n Such measures would have facilitated direct comparison of data between countries and improved timely understanding of the characteristics and impact of the pandemic.\n This paper describes the surveillance strategies in place before the pandemic and the methods that were used at global level to monitor the pandemic.\n Enhancements of global surveillance are proposed to improve preparedness and response for similar events in the

severity, and consultation rates, is essential to inform future control and prevention.\n\n We aimed to compare the community burden and severity of seasonal and pandemic influenza across different age groups and study years and gain insight into the extent to which traditional surveillance underestimates this burden.\n\n\nMethods\nUsing preseason and postseason serology, weekly illness reporting, and RT-PCR identification of influenza from nasal swabs, we tracked the course of seasonal and pandemic influenza over five successive cohorts (England 2006–11; 5448 person-seasons' follow-up).\n\n We compared burden and severity of seasonal and pandemic strains.\n\n We weighted analyses to the age and regional structure of England to give nationally representative estimates.\n\n We compared symptom profiles over the first week of illness for different strains of PCR-confirmed influenza and non-influenza viruses using ordinal logistic regression with symptom severity grade as the outcome variable.\n\n\nFindings\nBased on four-fold titre rises in strain-specific serology, on average influenza infected 18% (95% CI 16–22) of unvaccinated people each winter.\n\n Of those infected there were 69 respiratory illnesses per 100 person-influenza-seasons compared with 44 per 100 in those not infected with influenza.\n\n The age-adjusted attributable rate of illness if infected was 23 illnesses per 100 person-seasons (13–34), suggesting most influenza infections are asymptomatic.\n\n 25% (18–35) of all people with serologically confirmed infections had PCR-confirmed disease.\n\n 17% (10–26) of people with PCR-confirmed influenza had medically attended illness.\n\n These figures did not differ significantly when comparing pandemic with seasonal influenza.\n\n Of PCR-confirmed cases, people infected with the 2009 pandemic strain had markedly less severe symptoms than those infected with seasonal H3N2.\nInterpretation\nSeasonal influenza and the 2009 pandemic strain were characterised by similar high rates of mainly asymptomatic infection with most symptomatic cases self-managing without medical consultation.\n\n In the community the 2009 pandemic strain

an online survey of healthcare-seeking behaviour to estimate the magnitude and severity of the 2009 H1N1v influenza epidemic in England","abstract":"Background\nDuring the 2009 H1N1v influenza epidemic, the total number of symptomatic cases was estimated by combining influenza-like illness (ILI) consultations, virological surveillance and assumptions about healthcare-seeking behaviour.\n\n Changes in healthcare-seeking behaviour due to changing scientific information, media coverage and public anxiety, were not included in case estimates.\n\n The purpose of the study was to improve estimates of the number of symptomatic H1N1v cases and the case fatality rate (CFR) in England by quantifying healthcare-seeking behaviour using an internet-based survey carried out during the course of the 2009 H1N1v influenza epidemic.\n\n\nMethods\nWe used an online survey that ran continuously from July 2009 to March 2010 to estimate the proportion of ILI cases that sought healthcare during the 2009 H1N1v influenza epidemic.\n\n We used dynamic age- and gender-dependent measures of healthcare-seeking behaviour to re-interpret consultation numbers and estimate the true number of cases of symptomatic ILI in 2009 and the case fatality rate (CFR).\n\n\nResults\nThere were significant differences between age groups in healthcare usage.\n\n From the start to the end of the epidemic, the percentage of individuals with influenza-like symptoms who sought medical attention decreased from 43% to 32% (p &lt; 0.0001).\n\n Adjusting official numbers accordingly, we estimate that there were 1.1 million symptomatic cases in England, over 320,000 (40%) more cases than previously estimated and that the autumn epidemic wave was 45% bigger than previously thought.\n\n Combining symptomatic case numbers with reported deaths leads to a reduced overall CFR estimate of 17 deaths per 100,000 cases, with the largest reduction in adults.\n\n\nConclusions\nActive surveillance of healthcare-seeking behaviour, which can be achieved using novel data collection methods, is vital for providing accurate real-time estimates of epidemic size and disease severity.\n\n The differences in healthcare-seeking between different population groups and changes over time have significant implications for estimates of total case numbers and the case fatality rate.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3073914","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ellen","surname":"Brooks-Pollock","email":"Ellen.Brooks.Pollock@gmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Natasha","surname":"Tilston","email":"Natasha.Tilston@gmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"W

health-related Wikipedia articles were accessed each day between December 2007 and August 2013 and compared these data to official ILI activity levels provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n We developed a Poisson model that accurately estimates the level of ILI activity in the American population, up to two weeks ahead of the CDC, with an absolute average difference between the two estimates of just 0.27% over 294 weeks of data.\n Wikipedia-derived ILI models performed well through both abnormally high media coverage events (such as during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic) as well as unusually severe influenza seasons (such as the 2012–2013 influenza season).\n Wikipedia usage accurately estimated the week of peak ILI activity 17% more often than Google Flu Trends data

surveillance.\n\n\nMethods\nIndividuals affected by a foodborne illness can use this system to report their symptoms and the suspected location (eg, restaurant, hotel, hospital) of infection.\n\n We present descriptive statistics of users and businesses and highlight three instances where reports of foodborne illness were submitted before the outbreaks were officially confirmed by the local departments of health.\n\n\nResults\nMore than 49,000 reports of suspected foodborne illness have been submitted on Iwaspoisoned.\n\ncom since its inception by individuals from 89 countries and every state in the United States.\n\n Approximately 95.51% (42,139/44,119) of complaints implicated restaurants as the source of illness.\n\n Furthermore, an estimated 67.55% (3118/4616) of users who responded to a demographic survey were between the ages of 18 and 34, and 60.14% (2776/4616) of the respondents were female.\n\n The platform is also currently used by health departments in 90% (45/50) of states in the US to supplement existing programs on foodborne illness reporting.\n\n\nConclusions\nCrowdsourced disease surveillance through systems such as Iwaspoisoned.\n\ncom uses the influence and familiarity of social media to create an infrastructure for easy reporting and surveillance of suspected foodborne illness events.\n\n If combined with traditional surveillance approaches, these systems have the potential to lessen the problem of foodborne illness underreporting and aid in early detection and monitoring of foodborne disease outbreaks.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5517822","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Travis","surname":"Sanchez","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jenine","surname":"Harris","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Jenine","surname":"Harris","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Pei","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Patrick","surname":"Quade","email":"patrick@dinesafe.org","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Patrick","surname":"Quade","email":"patrick@dinesafe.org","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Elaine

online surveillance using Flusurvey","abstract":"Background\nInfluenza and Influenza-like-illness (ILI) represents a substantial public health problem, but it is difficult to measure the overall burden as many cases do not access health care.\n\n Community cohorts have the advantage of not requiring individuals to present at hospitals and surgeries and therefore can potentially monitor a wider variety of cases.\n\n This study reports on the incidence and risk factors for ILI in the UK as measured using Flusurvey, an internet-based open community cohort.\n\n\nMethods\nUpon initial online registration participants were asked background characteristics, and every week were asked to complete a symptoms survey.\n\n We compared the representativeness of our sample to the overall population.\n\n We used two case definitions of ILI, which differed in whether fever/chills was essential.\n\n We calculated ILI incidence week by week throughout the season, and investigated risk factors associated with ever reporting ILI over the course of the season.\n\n Risk factor analysis was conducted using binomial regression.\n\n\nResults\n5943 participants joined the survey, and 4532 completed the symptoms survey at least twice.\n\n Participants who filled in symptoms surveys at least twice filled in a median of nine symptoms surveys over the course of the study.\n\n 46.1% of participants reported at least one episode of ILI, and 6.0% of all reports were positive for ILI.\n\n Females had slightly higher incidence, and individuals over 65 had the lowest incidence.\n\n Incidence peaked just before Christmas and declined dramatically during school holidays.\n\n Multivariate regression showed that, for both definitions of ILI considered, being female, unvaccinated, having underlying health issues, having contact with children, being aged between 35 and 64, and being a smoker were associated with the highest risk of reporting an ILI.\n\n The use of public transport was not associated with an increased risk of ILI.\n\n\nConclusions\nOur results show that internet based surveillance can be used to measure ILI and understand risk factors.\n\n Vaccination is shown to be linked to a reduced risk of reporting ILI.\n\n Taking public transport does not increase the risk of reporting ILI.\n\n Flusurvey and other participatory surveillance techniques can be used to provide reliable information to policy makers in nearly real-time.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4025540","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Alma

developed the GoViral platform to evaluate whether a cohort of lay volunteers could, and would find it useful to, contribute self-reported symptoms online and to compare specimen types for self-collected diagnostic information of sufficient quality for respiratory infection surveillance.\n Volunteers were recruited, given a kit (collection materials and customized instructions),

detection sensitivity (via polymerase-chain-reaction) and ease of collection.\n Participants were surveyed to determine receptivity to participating when sick, to receiving information on the type of pathogen causing their infection and types circulating near them.\n Between December 1 2013 and March 1 2014, 295 participants enrolled in the study and received a kit.\n Of those who reported

surveillance of Influenza-like-illness in the UK during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic","abstract":"Background\nInternet-based surveillance systems to monitor influenza-like illness (ILI) have advantages over traditional (physician-based) reporting systems, as they can potentially monitor a wider range of cases (i.\n\ne.\n\n including those that do not seek care).\n\n However, the requirement for participants to have internet access and to actively participate calls into question the representativeness of the data.\n\n Such systems have been in place in a number of European countries over the last few years, and in July 2009 this was extended to the UK.\n\n Here we present results of this survey with the aim of assessing the reliability of the data, and to evaluate methods to correct for possible biases.\n\n\nMethods\nInternet-based monitoring of ILI was launched near the peak of the first wave of the UK H1N1v influenza pandemic.\n\n We compared the recorded ILI incidence with physician-recorded incidence and an estimate of the true number of cases over the course of the epidemic.\n\n We also compared overall attack rates.\n\n The effect of using different ILI definitions and alternative denominator assumptions on incidence estimates was explored.\n\n\nResults\nThe crude incidence measured by the internet-based system appears to be influenced by individuals who participated only once in the survey and who appeared more likely to be ill.\n\n This distorted the overall incidence trend.\n\n Concentrating on individuals who reported more than once results in a time series of ILI incidence that matches the trend of case estimates reasonably closely, with a correlation of 0.713 (P-value: 0.0001, 95% CI: 0.435, 0.867).\n\n Indeed, the internet-based system appears to give a better estimate of the relative height of the two waves of the UK pandemic than the physician-recorded incidence.\n\n The overall attack rate is, however, higher than other estimates, at about 16% when compared with a model-based estimate of 6%.\n\n\nConclusion\nInternet-based monitoring of ILI can capture the trends in case numbers if appropriate weighting is used to correct for differential response.\n\n The overall level of incidence is, however, difficult to measure.\n\n Internet-based systems may be a useful adjunct to existing ILI surveillance systems as they capture cases that do not necessarily contact health care.\n\n However, further research is required before they can be used to accurately assess the absolute level of incidence in the community.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2988734","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Natasha

regression with random effects was used to investigate the association between health-seeking and symptom severity, duration of illness and reduction in self-reported health-score over four flu seasons between 2011 and 2015.\nResults\nThe majority of individuals did not seek care.\n\n In general, there was very strong evidence for an association between all severity indicators and visiting a health service (p &lt; 0.0001).\n\n Being female (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.23–2.14, p = 0.0003) and a self-diagnosis of the flu (OR 3.39, 95% CI 2.38–4.83, p &lt; 0.0001) were also associated with increased likelihood of visiting a health service.\n\n During the 2012–13 and 2014–15 flu seasons, there was a significantly larger proportion of individuals with more severe sets of symptoms and a longer

surveillance.\n\n Similarly to other surveillance systems and to studies using online data collection, Internet-based surveillance will have biases in participation, affecting the generalizability of the results.\n\n Here we quantify the participation biases of Influenzanet, an ongoing European-wide network of Internet-based participatory surveillance systems for influenza-like-illness.\n\n\nMethods\nIn 2011/2012 Influenzanet launched a standardized common framework for data collection applied to seven European countries.\n\n Influenzanet participants were compared to the general population of the participating countries to assess the representativeness of the sample in terms of a set of demographic, geographic, socio-economic and health indicators.\n\n\nResults\nMore than 30,000 European residents registered to the system in the 2011/2012 season, and a subset of 25,481 participants were selected for this study.\n\n All age classes (10 years brackets) were represented in the cohort, including under 10 and over 70 years old.\n\n The Influenzanet population was not representative of the general population in terms of age distribution, underrepresenting the youngest and oldest age classes.\n\n The gender imbalance differed between countries.\n\n A counterbalance between gender-specific information-seeking behavior (more prominent in women) and Internet usage (with higher rates in male populations) may be at the origin of this difference.\n\n Once adjusted by demographic indicators, a similar propensity to commute was observed for each country, and the same top three transportation modes were used for six countries out of seven.\n\n Smokers were underrepresented in the majority of countries, as were individuals with diabetes; the representativeness of asthma prevalence and vaccination coverage for 65+ individuals in two successive seasons (2010/2011 and 2011/2012) varied between countries.\n\n\nConclusions\nExisting demographic and national datasets allowed the quantification of the participation biases of a large cohort for influenza-like-illness surveillance in the general population.\n\n Significant differences were found between Influenzanet participants and the general population.\n\n The quantified biases need to be taken into account in the analysis of Influenzanet

molecular testing of saliva specimens improves the detection of respiratory viruses","abstract":"Emerging infectious diseases in humans are often caused by respiratory viruses such as pandemic or avian influenza viruses and novel coronaviruses.\n Microbiological testing for respiratory viruses is important for patient management, infection control and epidemiological studies.\n Nasopharyngeal specimens are frequently tested, but their sensitivity is suboptimal.\n This study evaluated the incremental benefit of testing respiratory viruses in expectorated saliva using molecular assays.\n A total of 258 hospitalized adult patients with suspected respiratory infections were included.\n Their expectorated saliva was collected without the use of any special devices.\n In the first cohort of 159 patients whose nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) tested positive for respiratory viruses during routine testing, the viral load was measured using quantitative reverse transcription PCR.\n Seventeen percent of the patients (27/159) had higher viral loads in the saliva than in the NPA.\n The second cohort consisted of 99 patients whose NPAs tested negative for respiratory viruses using a direct immunofluorescence assay.\n Their NPA and saliva specimens were additionally tested using multiplex PCR.\n In these patients, the concordance rate by multiplex PCR between NPA and saliva was 83.8%.\n Multiplex PCR detected viruses in saliva samples from 16 patients, of which nine (56.3%) had at least one virus that was not detected in the NPA.\n Decisions on antiviral or isolation precautions would be affected by salivary testing in six patients.\n Although NPAs have high viral loads and remain the specimen of choice for most patients with respiratory virus infections, supplementary molecular testing of saliva can improve the clinical management of these patients.\n","id":"PMC5520312","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Kelvin

Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed, and the results of the two specimens were compared.\n\n\nResults\nTwo-hundred pairs of samples were collected.\n\n Sixty-nine (34.5%) individuals were male, and the median (interquartile) age was 36 (28–48) years.\n\n Using nasopharyngeal and throat swab RT-PCR as the reference standard, the prevalence of COVID-19 diagnosed by nasopharyngeal and throat swab RT-PCR was 9.5%.\n\n The sensitivity and specificity of the saliva sample RT-PCR were 84.2% (95% CI 60.4%–96.6%), and 98.9% (95% CI 96.1%–99.9%), respectively.\n\n An analysis of the agreement between the two specimens demonstrated 97.5% observed agreement (? coefficient 0.851, 95% CI 0.723–0.979; p &lt; 0.001).\n\n\nConclusions\nSaliva might be an alternative specimen for the diagnosis of COVID-19. The collection is non-invasive, and non-aerosol generating.\n\n This method could facilitate the diagnosis of the disease, given the simplicity of specimen collection and good diagnostic performance.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7227531","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"E.","surname":"Pasomsub","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"S.P.","surname":"Watcharananan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"K.","surname":"Boonyawat","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"P.","surname":"Janchompoo","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"G.","surname":"Wongtabtim","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"W.","surname":"Suksuwan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"S.","surname":"Sungkanuparph","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"A.","surname":"Phuphuakrat","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}],"References

characteristic (ROC) curves are useful tools to evaluate classifiers in biomedical and bioinformatics applications.\n\n However, conclusions are often reached through inconsistent use or insufficient statistical analysis.\n\n To support researchers in their ROC curves analysis we developed pROC, a package for R and S+ that contains a set of tools displaying, analyzing, smoothing and comparing ROC curves in a user-friendly, object-oriented and flexible interface.\n\n\nResults\nWith data previously imported into the R or S+ environment, the pROC package builds ROC curves and includes functions for computing confidence intervals, statistical tests for comparing total or partial area under the curve or the operating points of different classifiers, and methods for smoothing ROC curves.\n\n Intermediary and final results are visualised in user-friendly interfaces.\n\n A case study based on published clinical and biomarker data shows how to perform a typical ROC analysis with pROC.\n\n\nConclusions\npROC is a package for R and S+ specifically dedicated to ROC analysis.\n\n It proposes multiple statistical tests to compare ROC curves, and in particular partial areas under the curve, allowing proper ROC interpretation.\n\n pROC is available in two versions: in the R programming language or with a graphical user interface in the S+ statistical software.\n\n It is accessible at http://expasy.\n\norg/tools/pROC/ under the GNU General Public License.\n\n It is also distributed through the CRAN and CSAN public repositories, facilitating its installation.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3068975","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xavier","surname":"Robin","email":"Xavier.Robin@unige.ch","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Natacha","surname":"Turck","email":"Natacha.Turck@unige.ch","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alexandre","surname":"Hainard","email":"Alexandre.Hainard@unige.ch","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Natalia","surname":"Tiberti","email":"Natalia.Tiberti@unige.ch","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Frédérique","surname":"Lisacek","email":"Frederique.Lisacek@isb-sib.ch","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jean-Charles","surname":"Sanchez","email":"Jean-Charles.Sanchez@unige.ch","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Markus","surname":"Müller","email":"markus.mueller@isb-sib.ch","contributions":"1"}],"References

RT-PCR detects RNA, not infectious virus, thus its ability to determine duration of infectivity of patients is limited.\n\n Infectivity is a critical determinant in informing public health guidelines/interventions.\n\n Our goal was to determine the relationship between E gene SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values from respiratory samples, symptom onset to test (STT) and infectivity in cell culture.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective cross-sectional study, we took SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR confirmed positive samples and determined their ability to infect Vero cell lines.\n\n\nResults\nNinety RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 positive samples were incubated on Vero cells.\n\n Twenty-six samples (28.9%) demonstrated viral growth.\n\n Median TCID50/ml was 1780 (282-8511).\n\n There was no growth in samples with a Ct &gt; 24 or STT &gt; 8 days.\n\n Multivariate logistic regression using positive viral culture as a binary predictor variable, STT and Ct demonstrated an odds

SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic people is an urgent priority for the prevention and containment of disease outbreaks in communities.\n\n However, few data are available in asymptomatic persons regarding the accuracy of PCR testing.\n\n Additionally, although self-collected saliva has significant logistical advantages in mass screening, its utility as an alternative specimen in asymptomatic persons is yet to be determined.\n\n\nMethods\nWe conducted a mass-screening study to compare the utility of nucleic acid amplification, such as reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing, using nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) and saliva samples from each individual in two cohorts of asymptomatic persons: the contact tracing cohort and the airport quarantine cohort.\n\n\nResults\nIn this mass-screening study including 1,924 individuals, the sensitivity of nucleic acid amplification testing with nasopharyngeal and saliva specimens were 86% (90%CI:77-93%) and 92% (90%CI:83-97%),

SARS coronavirus during outbreak and post-epidemic periods","abstract":"Background:\nThe protocols of WHO network laboratories facilitated development of rapid diagnosis for SARS coronavirus (CoV) using reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assays.\n\n However, several reports have shown that conventional and real-time PCR assays were very specific for SARS CoV but lack sensitivity depending on the assay, specimen, and time course of disease.\n\n\nObjective:\nTo evaluate an automatic nucleic acid extraction system and two standardized real-time PCR assays for rapid diagnosis of SARS CoV during outbreak and post-epidemic periods in Hong Kong.\n\n\nStudy design:\nSpecimens from clinically suspected SARS patients collected during outbreak and post-epidemic periods were tested by an automatic nucleic acid extraction system followed by our first generation conventional RT-PCR and two standardized real-time PCR assays (Artus GmbH, Germany and Roche Diagnostics, Germany).\n\n Paired serum samples were assayed for increasing titer against SARS CoV.\n\n\nResults:\nIn the SARS epidemic, Artus and Roche PCR assays exhibited sensitivities of 87% and 85% for respiratory specimens (n = 64), 91% and 88% for stool (n = 44), and 82% for urine (n = 29).\n\n A specificity of 100% was exhibited by both PCR assays except Artus attained only a 92% specificity for stool.\n\n For post-epidemic period, no SARS CoV was identified among 56 respiratory specimens by all PCR assays.\n\n Inhibitors to PCR assays were detected at an average rate of 7–8% among 202 clinical specimens.\n\n\nConclusion:\nThis study highlights the high throughput and performance of automatic RNA extraction in coordination with standardized real-time PCR assays suitable for large-scale routine diagnosis in case of future SARS epidemic.\n\n As no SARS CoV was detected among specimens collected during post-epidemic period, the positive predictive value of real-time PCR assays for detection of SARS CoV during low epidemic requires further evaluation.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7108323","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"W.C.","surname":"Yam","email":"wcyam@hku.hk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"K.H.","surname":"Chan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"K.H.","surname":"Chow","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"L.L.M.","surname":"Poon","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"H.Y.","surname":"Lam","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"K.Y.","surname":"Yuen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"W.H.","surname":"Seto","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"J.S.M.","surname":"Peiris","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMc2001737","date":"1970-01-01","title":"SARS-CoV-2
