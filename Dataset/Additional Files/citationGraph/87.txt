{"SLR NAME":"Effect of COVID-19 on Tele-eyecare practice: a systematic review","SlR References":[{"doi":"10.4103/ijo.IJO_1089_20","date":"2020-05-15","title":"Tele-consultations and electronic medical records driven remote patient care: Responding to the COVID-19 lockdown in India","abstract":"Purpose:\nTo describe the experience of tele-consultations addressed at the centre of excellence of a multi-tier ophthalmology hospital network in India during the ongoing novel coronavirus (COVID-19) lockdown.\n\n\nMethods:\nThis cross-sectional hospital-based study included 7,008 tele-consultations presenting between March 23rd and April 19th 2020. A three-level protocol was implemented to triage the calls.\n\n The data of patient queries were collected using a Google Form/Sheets and the tele-calls were returned using the patient information retrieved from the electronic medical record system.\n\n\nResults:\nOverall, 7,008 tele-calls were addressed, of which 2,805 (40.02%) patients where a clinical-related query was answered were included for analysis.\n\n The most common queries were related to redness/pain/watering/blurring of vision (31.52%), closely followed by usage of medications (31.05%).\n\n The majority of the queries were directed to the department of cornea (34.15%), followed by retina (24.74%).\n\n Less than one-fifth of the patients were from the lower socio-economic class (16.08%) and one-fourth were new patients (23.96%).\n\n The most common advice given to the patient was related to management of medications (54.15%) followed by appointment related (17.79%).\n\n Emergency requests requiring further evaluation by an ophthalmologist accounted for a small percentage (16.36%) of patients.\n\n\nConclusion:\nTracking of tele-consultations and access to patient information from the electronic medical records enabled a timely response in an ongoing lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n The current experience provided valuable insights to the possibility of managing patient follow-up visits remotely in the future.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7508108","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Anthony

or tablets: qualitative assessment of medical experts","abstract":"Background\nMobile health has promising potential in improving healthcare delivery by facilitating access to expert advice.\n\n Enabling experts to review images on their smartphone or tablet may save valuable time.\n\n This study aims at assessing whether images viewed by medical specialists on handheld devices such as smartphones and tablets are perceived to be of comparable quality as when viewed on a computer screen.\n\n\nMethods\nThis was a prospective study comparing the perceived quality of 18 images on three different display devices (smartphone, tablet and computer) by 27 participants (4 burn surgeons and 23 emergency medicine specialists).\n\n The images, presented in random order, covered clinical (dermatological conditions, burns, ECGs and X-rays) and non-clinical subjects and their perceived quality was assessed using a 7-point Likert scale.\n\n Differences in devices' quality ratings were analysed using linear regression models for clustered data adjusting for image type and participants’ characteristics (age, gender and medical specialty).\n\n\nResults\nOverall, the images were rated good or very good in most instances and more so for the smartphone (83.1%, mean score 5.7) and tablet (78.2%, mean 5.5) than for a standard computer (70.6%, mean 5.2).\n\n Both handheld devices had significantly higher ratings than the computer screen, even after controlling for image type and participants' characteristics.\n\n Nearly all experts expressed that they would be comfortable using smartphones (n=25) or tablets (n=26) for image-based teleconsultation.\n\n\nConclusion\nThis study suggests that handheld devices could be a substitute for computer screens for teleconsultation by physicians working in emergency settings.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5384429","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Constance","surname":"Boissin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lisa","surname":"Blom","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lee","surname":"Wallis","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lucie","surname":"Laflamme","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1167/tvst.7.4.1","date":"2018-05-08","title":"Robotic

The third situation links to symptomatic cases in need of isolation.\n\n Examples include patients isolated in Taiwan during SARS epidemic in 2003 and H1N1 pandemic influenza in 2009, as well as H7N9 influenza infected patients in 2013 in China.\n\n The fourth situation involves tele-expertise when local medical resources do not have the technical expertise for the diagnosis or treatment of a patient and support is required from reference centres.\n\n The fifth situation corresponds to a healthcare facility under quarantine that would use telemedicine to keep taking care of patients that cannot access the facility, as it was the case in June 2015 in Seoul during the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus epidemic.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe use of telemedicine in epidemic situations has a high potential in improving epidemiological investigations, disease control, and clinical case management.\n\n However, since it is a recent application, further research would be needed to gain an improved understanding of how telemedicine could be applied in epidemic situations.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7148594","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"R.","surname":"Ohannessian","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1177/1357633x20916567","date":"2020-03-12","title":"Telehealth for global emergencies: Implications for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)","abstract":"The current coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is again reminding us of the importance of using telehealth to deliver care, especially as means of reducing the risk of cross-contamination caused by close contact.\n For telehealth to be effective as part of an emergency response it first needs to become a routinely used part of our health system.\n Hence, it is time to step back and ask why telehealth is not mainstreamed.\n In this article, we highlight key requirements for this to occur.\n Strategies to ensure that telehealth is used regularly in acute, post-acute and emergency situations, alongside conventional service delivery methods, include flexible funding arrangements, training and accrediting our health workforce.\n Telehealth uptake also requires a significant change in management effort and the redesign of existing models of care.\n Implementing telehealth proactively rather than reactively is more likely to generate greater benefits in the long-term, and help with the everyday (and emergency) challenges in healthcare.\n","id":"PMC7140977","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Anthony C","surname":"Smith","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Emma","surname":"Thomas","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Emma","surname":"Thomas","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Centaine L","surname":"Snoswell","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Centaine L","surname":"Snoswell","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Helen","surname":"Haydon","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Helen","surname":"Haydon","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ateev","surname":"Mehrotra","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Ateev","surname":"Mehrotra","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jane","surname":"Clemensen","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Jane","surname":"Clemensen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Liam J","surname":"Caffery","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1136/bmj.m1065","date":"1970-01-01","title":"On the front lines of coronavirus: the Italian response to covid-19","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1016/s0140-6736(20)30627-9","date":"1970-01-01","title":"COVID-19 and Italy: what next?","abstract":"The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has already taken on pandemic proportions, affecting over 100 countries in a matter of weeks.\n A global response to prepare health systems worldwide is imperative.\n Although containment measures in China have reduced new cases by more than 90%, this reduction is not the case elsewhere, and Italy has been particularly affected.\n There is now grave concern regarding the Italian national health system's capacity to effectively respond to the needs of patients who are infected and require intensive care for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n The percentage of patients in intensive care reported daily in Italy between March 1 and March 11, 2020, has consistently been between 9% and 11% of patients who are actively infected.\n The number of patients infected since Feb 21 in Italy closely follows an exponential trend.\n If this trend continues for 1 more week, there will be 30?000 infected patients.\n Intensive care units will then be at maximum capacity; up to 4000 hospital beds will be needed by mid-April, 2020.
