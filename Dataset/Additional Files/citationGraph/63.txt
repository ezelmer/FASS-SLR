efficiency of a drive-through (DT) screening system for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by comparing it with a conventional screening system.\n\n We reviewed and analyzed the SARS-CoV-2 screening data obtained at our university hospital.\n\n We compared the number of tests for SARS-CoV-2 (using real-time polymerase chain reaction) performed using two different specimen collection systems—DT and conventional—during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in Daegu.\n\n Based on the results, the DT screening system collected 5.8 times more specimens for testing than the conventional screening system.\n\n From 27 January to 31 March 2020, 6211 individuals were screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection using either the DT or conventional system.\n\n In total, 217 individuals tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (positive rate: 3.50%).\n\n Of the 6211 individuals, 3368 were symptomatic or had a history of contact with COVID-19 patients, and 142 of them tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (positive rate: 4.22%).\n\n Further, 2843 individuals were asymptomatic and had no history of contact with COVID-19 patients, and 75 of them tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (positive rate: 2.64%).\n\n In conclusion, the DT system allowed clinicians to collect specimens for SARS-CoV-2 screening more efficiently than the conventional system.\n\n Furthermore, as there might be several COVID-19 patients who remain asymptomatic, expanding the screening test to asymptomatic individuals would be necessary.\n\n","id":"PMC7348970","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Min Cheol","surname":"Chang","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"

dynamics of transmission and control of COVID-19: a mathematical modelling study","abstract":"Background\nAn outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to 95?333 confirmed cases as of March 5, 2020. Understanding the early transmission dynamics of the infection and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures is crucial for assessing the potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas.\n\n Combining a mathematical model of severe SARS-CoV-2 transmission with four datasets from within and outside Wuhan, we estimated how transmission in Wuhan varied between December, 2019, and February, 2020. We used these estimates to assess the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission to occur in locations outside Wuhan if cases were introduced.\n\n\nMethods\nWe combined a stochastic transmission model with data on cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan and international cases that originated in Wuhan to estimate how transmission had varied over time during January, 2020, and February, 2020. Based on these estimates, we then calculated the probability that newly introduced cases might generate outbreaks in other areas.\n\n To estimate the early dynamics of transmission in Wuhan, we fitted a stochastic transmission dynamic model to multiple publicly available datasets on cases in Wuhan and internationally exported cases from Wuhan.\n\n The four datasets we fitted to were: daily number of new internationally exported cases (or lack thereof), by date of onset, as of Jan 26, 2020; daily number of new cases in Wuhan with no market exposure, by date of onset, between Dec 1, 2019, and Jan 1, 2020; daily number of new cases in China, by date of onset, between Dec 29, 2019, and Jan 23, 2020; and proportion of infected passengers on evacuation flights between Jan 29, 2020, and Feb 4, 2020. We used an additional two datasets for comparison with model outputs: daily number of new exported cases from Wuhan (or lack thereof) in countries with high connectivity to Wuhan (ie, top 20 most at-risk countries), by date of confirmation, as of Feb 10, 2020; and data on new confirmed cases reported in Wuhan between Jan 16, 2020, and Feb 11, 2020.\nFindings\nWe estimated that the median daily reproduction number (Rt) in Wuhan declined from 2·35 (95% CI 1·15–4·77) 1 week before travel restrictions were introduced on Jan 23, 2020, to 1·05 (0·41–2·39) 1 week after.\n\n Based on our estimates of Rt, assuming SARS-like variation, we calculated that in locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan in early January, once there are at least four independently introduced cases, there is a more than 50% chance the infection will establish within that population.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur results show that COVID-19 transmission probably declined in Wuhan during late January, 2020, coinciding with the introduction of travel control measures.\n\n As more cases arrive in international locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan before these control measures, it is likely many chains of transmission will fail to establish initially, but might lead to new outbreaks eventually.\n\n\nFunding\nWellcome Trust, Health Data Research UK, Bill &amp; Melinda Gates

Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions.\n\n In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male.\n\n The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases.\n\n The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.\n\n In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days.\n\n With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).\n\n\nConclusions\nOn the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere.\n\n Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in

individuals to be tested for COVID-19 is rapidly increasing.\n For safe and efficient screening for COVID-19, drive-through (DT) screening centers have been designed and implemented in Korea.\n Herein, we present the overall concept, advantages, and limitations of the COVID-19 DT screening centers.\n The steps of the DT centers include registration, examination, specimen collection, and instructions.\n The entire service takes about 10 minutes for one testee without leaving his or her cars.\n Increased testing capacity over 100 tests per day and prevention of cross-infection between testees in the waiting space are the major advantages, while protection of staff from the outdoor atmosphere is challenging.\n It could be implemented in other countries to cope with the global

2020","abstract":"Background\nOn 07/02/2020, French Health authorities were informed of a confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus in an Englishman infected in Singapore who had recently stayed in a chalet in the French Alps.\n\n We conducted an investigation to identify secondary cases and interrupt transmission.\n\n\nMethods\nWe defined as a confirmed case a person linked to the chalet with a positive RT-PCR sample for SARS-CoV-2.\nResults\nThe index case stayed 4 days in the chalet with 10 English tourists and a family of 5 French residents; SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 5 individuals in France, 6 in England (including the index case), and 1 in Spain (overall attack rate in the chalet: 75%).\n\n One pediatric case, with picornavirus and influenza A coinfection, visited 3 different schools while symptomatic.\n\n One case was asymptomatic, with similar viral load as that of a symptomatic case.\n\n Seven days after the first cases were diagnosed, one tertiary case was detected in a symptomatic patient with a positive endotracheal aspirate; all previous and concurrent nasopharyngeal specimens were negative.\n\n Additionally, 172 contacts were monitored, including 73 tested negative for SARS-CoV-2.\nConclusions\nThe occurrence in this cluster of one asymptomatic case with similar viral load as a symptomatic patient, suggests transmission potential of asymptomatic individuals.\n\n The fact that an infected child did not transmit the disease despite close interactions within schools suggests potential different transmission dynamics in children.\n\n Finally, the dissociation between upper and lower respiratory tract results underscores the need for close monitoring of the clinical evolution of suspect Covid-19 cases.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7184384","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Kostas","surname":"Danis","email":"Costas.danis@santepubliquefrance.fr","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Olivier","surname":"Epaulard","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Thomas","surname":"Bénet","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alexandre","surname":"Gaymard","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Séphora","surname":"Campoy","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Elisabeth","surname":"Bothelo-Nevers","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Maude","surname":"Bouscambert-Duchamp","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guillaume","surname":"Spaccaferri","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Florence","surname":"Ader","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alexandra","surname":"Mailles","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zoubida","surname":"Boudalaa","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Violaine","surname":"Tolsma","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Julien","surname":"Berra","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sophie","surname":"Vaux","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Emmanuel","surname":"Forestier","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Caroline","surname":"Landelle","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Erica","surname":"Fougere","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alexandra","surname":"Thabuis","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Philippe","surname":"Berthelot","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Raphael","surname":"Veil","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Daniel","surname":"Levy-Bruhl","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christian","surname":"Chidiac","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Bruno","surname":"Lina","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bruno","surname":"Coignard","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Christine","surname":"Saura","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Elise","surname":"Brottet","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Delphine","surname":"Casamatta","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yves","surname":"Gallien","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Scarlett","surname":"George","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Delphine","surname":"Viriot","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Fatima","surname":"Belghiti","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sibylle","surname":"Bernard-Stoecklin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jean-Claude","surname":"Desenclos","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Coralie","surname":"Giese","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ghislain","surname":"Didier","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Magali","surname":"Gounon","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nathalie","surname":"Grangeret","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Cécile","surname":"Marie","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Bruno","surname":"Morel","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Muriel","surname":"Deher","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Anne-Sophie","surname":"Ronnaux-Baron","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Geneviève","surname":"Courbis","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nathalie","surname":"Ragozin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Monika","surname":"Wolska","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Eric","surname":"Serange","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Delphine","surname":"Mercatello","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Soraya","surname":"Aiouaz","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Martine","surname":"Valette","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Emilie","surname":"Frobert","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Laurence","surname":"Josset","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Vanessa","surname":"Escuret","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Florence","surname":"Morfin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Geneviève","surname":"Billaud","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Myriam","surname":"Blanc","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Julie","surname":"Arata-Bardet","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Marie","surname":"Froidure","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Marion","surname":"Le
