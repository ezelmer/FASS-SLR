Iran","abstract":"Background\nFall is a worldwide health problem among elderly people and a known leading cause of disabilities.\n\n Fall prevention programs have been implemented in various forms.\n\n The Otago exercise program (OEP) is one of the most recent home-base exercise training program.\n\n\nObjectives\nThis study was conducted to examine the effectiveness of OEP to reduce falls among elderly people in Shahroud, IR Iran.\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\nThis randomised control trial was conducted among the elderly community dwellers in Shahroud city of the Semnan province, IR Iran, with experience of falls in the last 12 months.\n\n Subjects of the study (n = 317) were recruited from elderly senior citizens at public health centers.\n\n Block systematic random sampling was applied to categorize the subjects in experimental and control groups.\n\n The experimental group (n = 160) received OEP for six months and was compared with the control group (n = 157) who received general health training.\n\n This study was registered with the following ID, IRCT2014012016285N1.\nResults\nThe findings of the study showed that OEP improved physical performance (Berg-Balance-Score with P &gt; 0.025, and Timed-Up-Go-Test with P &gt; 0.017) and functional capacity (Arm-Curl-Test with P &gt; 0.00 and Chair-Stand-Test with P &gt; 0.01).\n\n In addition, OEP significantly reduced the incidence of falls (P ? 0.00) among senior citizens in the experimental group.\n\n\nDiscussion\nThe OEP as a home-based exercise is effective for the reduction of the incidence of falls among senior citizens with a history of falls.\n\n The OEP can be recommended for elderly homebound people who do not have access to facilities.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4948256","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ali","surname":"Dadgari","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tengku","surname":"Aizan

of older citizens.\n\n Despite the now substantial evidence about effective falls prevention interventions, translation into falls reductions has not yet been fully realised.\n\n While the hip fracture rate is decreasing, the number and rate of fall-related hospital admissions among older people is increasing.\n\n The challenge now is to deliver the most effective interventions efficiently at a population level, and for these interventions to be taken up by older people.\n\n\nObjective\nTo support the development, and evaluation of, effective falls prevention policy and practice in the state of Victoria, Australia.\n\n\nMethods\nThe RE-AIM model (Reach, Efficacy, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance) was used to identify strategies for an effective programme.\n\n Research objectives were developed to support the strategies.\n\n These include: (1) identification of subgroups of older people most frequently admitted to hospital for falls; (2) examining the acceptability of established falls interventions; (3) identification of factors that encourage and support relevant lifestyle changes; (4) identifying opportunities to incorporate confirmed interventions in existing programmes and services; (5) developing guidelines for sustainability.\n\n The research results will subsequently guide strategy details for the falls prevention plan.\n\n RE-AIM will provide the framework for the evaluation structure.\n\n\nOutcome measures\nMeasures to monitor the implementation of the selected interventions will be determined for each intervention, based on the five key factors of the RE-AIM model.\n\n The overall effect of the falls prevention plan will be monitored by time series analysis of fall-related hospital admission rates for community-dwelling older people.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3064867","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Lesley","surname":"Day","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Caroline

exercise and osteoporosis education program for older adults at risk of falls and fractures","abstract":"Background\nOsteoporosis affects over 220 million people worldwide, and currently there is no ‘cure’ for the disease.\n\n Thus, there is a need to develop evidence-based, safe and acceptable prevention strategies at the population level that target multiple risk factors for fragility fractures to reduce the health and economic burden of the condition.\n\n\nMethods/design\nThe Osteo-cise: Strong Bones for Life study will investigate the effectiveness and feasibility of a multi-component targeted exercise, osteoporosis education/awareness and behavioural change program for improving bone health and muscle function and reducing falls risk in community-dwelling older adults at an increased risk of fracture.\n\n Men and women aged ?60?years will participate in an 18-month randomised controlled trial comprising a 12-month structured and supervised community-based program and a 6-month ‘research to practise’ translational phase.\n\n Participants will be randomly assigned to either the Osteo-cise intervention or a self-management control group.\n\n The intervention will comprise a multi-modal exercise program incorporating high velocity progressive resistance training, moderate impact weight-bearing exercise and high challenging balance exercises performed three times weekly at local community-based fitness centres.\n\n A behavioural change program will be used to enhance exercise adoption and adherence to the program.\n\n Community-based osteoporosis education seminars will be conducted to improve participant knowledge and understanding of the risk factors and preventative measures for osteoporosis, falls and fractures.\n\n The primary outcomes measures, to be collected at baseline, 6, 12, and 18?months, will include DXA-derived hip and spine bone mineral density measurements and functional muscle power (timed stair-climb test).\n\n Secondary outcomes measures include: MRI-assessed distal femur and proximal tibia trabecular bone micro-architecture, lower limb and back maximal muscle strength, balance and function (four square step test, functional reach test, timed up-and-go test and 30-second sit-to-stand), falls incidence and health-related quality of life.\n\n Cost-effectiveness will also be assessed.\n\n\nDiscussion\nThe findings from the Osteo-cise: Strong Bones for Life study will provide new information on the efficacy of a targeted multi-modal community-based exercise program incorporating high velocity resistance training, together with an osteoporosis education and behavioural change program for improving multiple risk factors for falls and fracture in older adults at risk of fragility fracture.\n\n\nTrial registration\nAustralian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry reference

community-based randomised controlled trial of a multi-modal exercise and osteoporosis education program for older adults at risk of falls and fractures","abstract":"Background\nOsteoporosis affects over 220 million people worldwide, and currently there is no ‘cure’ for the disease.\n\n Thus, there is a need to develop evidence-based, safe and acceptable prevention strategies at the population level that target multiple risk factors for fragility fractures to reduce the health and economic burden of the condition.\n\n\nMethods/design\nThe Osteo-cise: Strong Bones for Life study will investigate the effectiveness and feasibility of a multi-component targeted exercise, osteoporosis education/awareness and behavioural change program for improving bone health and muscle function and reducing falls risk in community-dwelling older adults at an increased risk of fracture.\n\n Men and women aged ?60?years will participate in an 18-month randomised controlled trial comprising a 12-month structured and supervised community-based program and a 6-month ‘research to practise’ translational phase.\n\n Participants will be randomly assigned to either the Osteo-cise intervention or a self-management control group.\n\n The intervention will comprise a multi-modal exercise program incorporating high velocity progressive resistance training, moderate impact weight-bearing exercise and high challenging balance exercises performed three times weekly at local community-based fitness centres.\n\n A behavioural change program will be used to enhance exercise adoption and adherence to the program.\n\n Community-based osteoporosis education seminars will be conducted to improve participant knowledge and understanding of the risk factors and preventative measures for osteoporosis, falls and fractures.\n\n The primary outcomes measures, to be collected at baseline, 6, 12, and 18?months, will include DXA-derived hip and spine bone mineral density measurements and functional muscle power (timed stair-climb test).\n\n Secondary outcomes measures include: MRI-assessed distal femur and proximal tibia trabecular bone micro-architecture, lower limb and back maximal muscle strength, balance and function (four square step test, functional reach test, timed up-and-go test and 30-second sit-to-stand), falls incidence and health-related quality of life.\n\n Cost-effectiveness will also be assessed.\n\n\nDiscussion\nThe findings from the Osteo-cise: Strong Bones for Life study will provide new information on the efficacy of a targeted multi-modal community-based exercise program incorporating high velocity resistance training, together with an osteoporosis education and behavioural change program for improving multiple risk factors for falls and fracture in older adults at risk of fragility fracture.\n\n\nTrial registration\nAustralian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry reference

well-established intervention to reduce falls in cognitively intact older people, although there is limited randomised trial evidence of outcomes in people with dementia.\n\n The primary objective of this study is to evaluate whether a home-based balance exercise programme improves balance performance in people with mild to moderate severity Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\nMethods/design\nTwo hundred and fourteen community dwelling participants with mild to moderate severity Alzheimer's disease will be recruited for the randomised controlled trial.\n\n A series of laboratory and clinical measures will be used to evaluate balance and mobility performance at baseline.\n\n Participants will then be randomized to receive either a balance training home exercise programme (intervention group) from a physiotherapist, or an education, information and support programme from an occupational therapist (control group).\n\n Both groups will have six home visits in the six months following baseline assessment, as well as phone support.\n\n All participants will be re-assessed at the completion of the programme (after six months), and again in a further six months to evaluate sustainability of outcomes.\n\n The primary outcome measures will be the Limits of Stability (a force platform measure of balance) and the Step Test (a clinical measure of balance).\n\n Secondary outcomes include other balance and mobility measures, number of falls and falls risk measures, cognitive and behavioural measures, and carer burden and quality of life measures.\n\n Assessors will be blind to group allocation.\n\n\nDiscussion\nBy introducing a balance programme at an early stage of the dementia pathway, when participants are more likely capable of safe and active participation in balance training, there is potential that balance performance will be improved as dementia progresses, which may reduce the high falls risk at this later stage.\n\n If successful, this approach has the potential for widespread application through community based services for people with mild to moderate severity Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\nTrial registration\nThe protocol for this study is registered

for assessing physical activity in adults: a systematic review","abstract":"Background\nAccurate assessment is required to assess current and changing physical activity levels, and to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions designed to increase activity levels.\n\n This study systematically reviewed the literature to determine the extent of agreement between subjectively (self-report e.\n\ng.\n\n questionnaire, diary) and objectively (directly measured; e.\n\ng.\n\n accelerometry, doubly labeled water) assessed physical activity in adults.\n\n\nMethods\nEight electronic databases were searched to identify observational and experimental studies of adult populations.\n\n Searching identified 4,463 potential articles.\n\n Initial screening found that 293 examined the relationship between self-reported and directly measured physical activity and met the eligibility criteria.\n\n Data abstraction was completed for 187 articles, which described comparable data and/or comparisons, while 76 articles lacked comparable data or comparisons, and a further 30 did not meet the review's eligibility requirements.\n\n A risk of bias assessment was conducted for all articles from which data was abstracted.\n\n\nResults\nCorrelations between self-report and direct measures were generally low-to-moderate and ranged from -0.71 to 0.96. No clear pattern emerged for the mean differences between self-report and direct measures of physical activity.\n\n Trends differed by measure of physical activity employed, level of physical activity measured, and the gender of participants.\n\n Results of the risk of bias assessment indicated that 38% of the studies had lower quality scores.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe findings suggest that the measurement method may have a significant impact on the observed levels of physical activity.\n\n Self-report measures of physical activity were both higher and lower than directly measured levels of physical activity, which poses a problem for both reliance on self-report measures and for attempts to correct for self-report – direct measure differences.\n\n This review reveals the need for valid, accurate and reliable measures of physical activity in evaluating current and changing physical activity levels, physical activity interventions, and the relationships between physical activity and health outcomes.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2588639","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Stéphanie A","surname":"Prince","email":"sprin063@uottawa.ca","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kristi B","surname":"Adamo","email":"kadamo@cheo.on.ca","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Meghan E","surname":"Hamel","email":"meghanhamel@gmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jill","surname":"Hardt","email":"jillhardt@gmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sarah Connor","surname":"Gorber","email":"Sarah.ConnorGorber@statcan.ca","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mark","surname":"Tremblay","email":"mtremblay@cheo.on.ca","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1177/0269215506069475","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A systematic review of the human activity profile","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1111/j.1532-5415.2005.53455.x","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Development of a common outcome data set for fall injury prevention trials: the prevention of falls network Europe consensus","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Effects of preventive home visits to elderly people living in the community: systematic review.","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[],"References depth 2":[]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMcp020719","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical practice.

However, no clear relationship has been established between these two factors in elderly population.\n This study aimed to examine the association between plantar flexion strength and balance performance in elderly men and women.\n Forty-three men and 35 women aged over 65 years performed isometric plantar flexion as fast and hard as possible.\n From the time-torque curve, the rate of torque development in time intervals of 30, 50, 100, 150, and 200 ms from the onset of contraction was determined and normalized to peak torque.\n In addition, the center of pressure displacement during single-leg standing was calculated and normalized to height.\n When the data were collapsed over sexes, the normalized rate of torque development was negatively correlated with the normalized center of pressure displacement, except for the time interval of 200 ms.\n By sex, regardless of the time interval, there was a negative correlation between the normalized rate of torque development and the normalized center of pressure displacement in the elderly men but not in the elderly women.\n No correlation was seen between the peak torque and normalized center of pressure displacement in either pooled or separated data.\n The findings suggest that the capability of rapid force production rather than maximal force production of the plantar flexion is important for balance ability in elderly men, but this capability may not be relevant in elderly women.\n","id":"PMC5266226","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ryoichi","surname":"Ema","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Megumi","surname":"Saito","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shunsuke","surname":"Ohki","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hirokazu","surname":"Takayama","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yosuke","surname":"Yamada","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ryota","surname":"Akagi","email":"rakagi12@sic.shibaura-it.ac.jp","contributions":"1"}],"References

investigated in elderly fallers (EF).\n The purpose of this study was thus to analyze the relationship between the MIT of ankle muscles and CoP displacement in upright stance in a sample aged between 18 and 90 years old that included EF.\n The aim was to identify a threshold of torque below which balance is compromised.\n The MIT of Plantar flexors (PFs) and dorsal flexors (DFs) and CoP were measured in 90 volunteers: 21 healthy young adults (YA) (age: 24.1 ± 5.0), 12 healthy middle-aged adults (MAA) (age: 50.2 ± 4.5), 27 healthy elderly non-fallers (ENF) (age: 75.5 ± 7.0) and 30 EF (age: 78.8 ± 6.7).\n The MIT of PF and DF were summed to obtain the overall maximal ankle muscle strength.\n Body weight and height were used to normalize MIT (nMIT) and CoP (nCoP), respectively.\n nCoP correlated negatively with nMIT.\n 90% of EF generated an nMIT &lt;3.1 N·m·kg?1, whereas 85% of non-fallers generated an nMIT &gt;3.1 N·m·kg?1.\n The relationship between nMIT and nCoP implies that ankle muscle weakness contributes to increased postural instability and the risk of falling.\n We observed that below the threshold of 3.1 N·m·kg?1, postural stability was dramatically diminished and balance was compromised.\n Our results suggest that measuring ankle torque could be used in routine clinical practice to identify potential fallers.\n","id":"PMC4271599","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Thomas","surname":"Cattagni","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Gil","surname":"Scaglioni","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Davy","surname":"Laroche","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jacques","surname":"Van

development during rapid contractions has recently become quite popular for characterising explosive strength of athletes, elderly individuals and patients.\n The main aims of this narrative review are to describe the neuromuscular determinants of rate of force development and to discuss various methodological considerations inherent to its evaluation for research and clinical purposes.\n Rate of force development (1) seems to be mainly determined by the capacity to produce maximal voluntary activation in the early phase of an explosive contraction (first 50–75 ms), particularly as a result of increased motor unit discharge rate; (2) can be improved by both explosive-type and heavy-resistance strength training in different subject populations, mainly through an improvement in rapid muscle activation; (3) is quite difficult to evaluate in a valid and reliable way.\n Therefore, we provide evidence-based practical recommendations for rational quantification of rate of force development in both laboratory and clinical settings.\n","id":"PMC4875063","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Nicola

POSTNATAL DIFFERENTIATION OF RAT SKELETAL MUSCLE","abstract":" An electron microscope study has been carried out on rat psoas muscle, during the early postnatal stages of development.\n Among the several subcellular components, the sarcotubular system undergoes the most striking modifications during this period.\n In muscle fibers of the newborn rat, junctional contacts between the T system and the SR are sparse and are, mostly, longitudinally or obliquely oriented.\n The T tubules do not penetrate deeply into the muscle cell, as indicated by the predominantly peripheral location of the triads and the persistence, at these stages of development, of a highly branched subsarcolemmal system of tubules.\n Diadic associations of junctional SR elements with the plasma membrane are also occasionally observed.\n The early SR elaborations incompletely delineate the myofibrils, at both the A- and I-band level.\n Longitudinal sections show irregularly oriented SR tubules, running continuously over successive sarcomeres.\n Flattened junctional cisterns filled with granular material are sparse and laterally interconnected, at circumscribed sites, with the SR tubules.\n Between 1 and 2 wk postpartum, transversal triadic contacts are extensively established, at the A-I band level, and the SR network differentiates into two portions in register with the A and I band, respectively.\n At 10–15 days after birth, the SR provides a transversely continuous double sheet around the myofibrils at the I-band level, whereas it forms a single discontinuous layer at the A-band level.\n The relationship that these morphological modifications of the sarcotubular system may bear to previously described biochemical and physiological changes of rat muscle fibers after birth is discussed.\n

25 studies), but had small effects on measures of muscle morphology (mean SMDbs = 0.42; nine studies).\n\n Specifically, RT produced large effects in both 1RM of upper (mean SMDbs = 1.61; 11 studies) and lower (mean SMDbs = 1.76; 19 studies) extremities and a medium effect in MVC of lower (mean SMDbs = 0.76; four studies) extremities.\n\n Results of the meta-regression revealed that the variables “training period” (p = 0.04) and “intensity” (p &lt; 0.01) as well as “total time under tension” (p &lt; 0.01) had significant effects on muscle strength, with the largest effect sizes for the longest training periods (mean SMDbs = 2.34; 50–53 weeks), intensities of 70–79 % of the 1RM (mean SMDbs = 1.89), and total time under tension of 6.0 s (mean SMDbs = 3.61).\n\n A tendency towards significance was found for rest in between sets (p = 0.06), with 60 s showing the largest effect on muscle strength (mean SMDbs = 4.68; two studies).\n\n We also determined the independent effects of the remaining training variables on muscle strength.\n\n The following independently computed training variables are most effective in improving measures of muscle strength: a training frequency of two sessions per week (mean SMDbs = 2.13), a training volume of two to three sets per exercise (mean SMDbs = 2.99), seven to nine repetitions per set (mean SMDbs = 1.98), and a rest of 4.0 s between repetitions (SMDbs = 3.72).\n\n With regard to measures of muscle morphology, the small number of identified studies allowed us to calculate meta-regression for the subcategory training volume only.\n\n No single training volume variable significantly predicted RT effects on measures of muscle morphology.\n\n Additional training variables were independently computed to detect the largest effect for the single training variable.\n\n A training period of 50–53 weeks, a training frequency of three sessions per week, a training volume of two to three sets per exercise, seven to nine repetitions per set, a training intensity from 51 to 69 % of the 1RM, a total time under tension of 6.0 s, a rest of 120 s between sets, and a rest of 2.5 s between repetitions turned out to be most effective.\n\n\nLimitations\nThe current results must be interpreted with caution because of the poor overall methodological study quality (mean PEDro score 4.6 points) and the considerable large heterogeneity (I2 = 80 %, ?2 = 163.1, df = 32, p &lt; 0.01) for muscle strength.\n\n In terms of muscle morphology, our search identified nine studies only, which is why we consider our findings preliminary.\n\n While we were able to determine a dose–response relationship based on specific individual training variables with respect to muscle strength and morphology, it was not possible to ascertain any potential interactions between these variables.\n\n We recognize the limitation that the results may not represent one general dose–response relationship.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis systematic literature review and meta-analysis confirmed the effectiveness of RT on specific measures of upper and lower extremity muscle strength and muscle morphology in healthy old adults.\n\n In addition, we were able to extract dose–response relationships for key training variables (i.\n\ne.\n\n, volume, intensity, rest), informing clinicians and practitioners to design effective RTs for muscle strength and morphology.\n\n Training period, intensity, time under tension, and rest in between sets play an important role in improving muscle strength and morphology and should be implemented in exercise training programs targeting healthy old adults.\n\n Still, further research is needed to reveal optimal dose–response relationships following RT in healthy as well as mobility limited and/or frail old adults.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4656698","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Ron","surname":"Borde","email":"rborde@uni-potsdam.de","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tibor","surname":"Hortobágyi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Urs","surname":"Granacher","email":"urs.granacher@uni-potsdam.de","contributions":"3"}]},{"doi":"10.1007/s12662-011-0218-4","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Effects of balance and resistance training in children, adolescents, and seniors","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1186/1471-2318-12-68","date":"2012-11-03","title":"Residual effects of muscle strength and muscle power training and detraining on physical function in community-dwelling prefrail older adults: a randomized controlled trial","abstract":"Background\nAlthough resistance exercise interventions have been shown to be beneficial in prefrail or frail older adults it remains unclear whether there are residual effects when the training is followed by a period of detraining.\n\n The aim of this study was to establish the sustainability of a muscle power or muscle strength training effect in prefrail older adults following training and detraining.\n\n\nMethods\n69 prefrail community-dwelling older adults, aged 65–94 years were randomly assigned into three groups: muscle strength training (ST), muscle power training (PT) or controls.\n\n The exercise interventions were performed for 60 minutes, twice a week over 12 weeks.\n\n Physical function (Short Physical Performance Battery=SPPB), muscle power (sit-to-stand transfer=STS), self-reported function (SF-LLFDI) and appendicular lean mass (aLM) were measured at baseline and at 12, 24 and 36 weeks after the start of the intervention.\n\n\nResults\nFor the SPPB, significant intervention effects were found at 12 weeks in both exercise groups (ST: p = 0.0047;

Additional articles were searched by citation search, author search, and reference lists of relevant articles.\n\n The protocol for this review was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42016032905).\n\n\nResults\nTwelve studies were included, reporting a large diversity of interventions in terms of content, duration, and follow-up period.\n\n Overall, multi-domain interventions tended to be more effective than mono-domain interventions on frailty status or score, muscle mass and strength, and physical functioning.\n\n Results were inconclusive for cognitive, functional, and social outcomes.\n\n Physical exercise seems to play an essential role in the multi-domain intervention, whereby additional interventions can lead to further improvement (eg, nutritional intervention).\n\n\nConclusion\nEvidence of beneficial effects of multi-domain compared to mono-domain interventions is limited but increasing.\n\n Additional studies are needed, focusing on a well-defined frail population and with specific attention to the design and the individual contribution of mono-domain interventions.\n\n This will contribute to the development of more effective interventions for frail elderly.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5448695","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Lenore","surname":"Dedeyne","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mieke","surname":"Deschodt","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Sabine","surname":"Verschueren","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jos","surname":"Tournoy","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Evelien","surname":"Gielen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}],"References

Type 2 Diabetes With the Mediterranean Diet","abstract":"OBJECTIVE\nTo test the effects of two Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) interventions versus a low-fat diet on incidence of diabetes.\n\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\nThis was a three-arm randomized trial in 418 nondiabetic subjects aged 55–80 years recruited in one center (PREDIMED-Reus, northeastern Spain) of the Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea [PREDIMED] study, a large nutrition intervention trial for primary cardiovascular prevention in individuals at high cardiovascular risk.\n\n Participants were randomly assigned to education on a low-fat diet (control group) or to one of two MedDiets, supplemented with either free virgin olive oil (1 liter/week) or nuts (30 g/day).\n\n Diets were ad libitum, and no advice on physical activity was given.\n\n The main outcome was diabetes incidence diagnosed by the 2009 American Diabetes Association criteria.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAfter a median follow-up of 4.0 years, diabetes incidence was 10.1% (95% CI 5.1–15.1), 11.0% (5.9–16.1), and 17.9% (11.4–24.4) in the MedDiet with olive oil group, the MedDiet with nuts group, and the control group, respectively.\n\n Multivariable adjusted hazard ratios of diabetes were 0.49 (0.25–0.97) and 0.48 (0.24–0.96) in the MedDiet supplemented with olive oil and nuts groups, respectively, compared with the control group.\n\n When the two MedDiet groups were pooled and compared with the control group, diabetes incidence was reduced by 52% (27–86).\n\n In all study arms, increased adherence to the MedDiet was inversely associated with diabetes incidence.\n\n Diabetes risk reduction occurred in the absence of significant changes in body weight or physical activity.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMedDiets without calorie restriction seem to be effective in the prevention of diabetes in subjects at high cardiovascular risk.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3005482","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Jordi","surname":"Salas-Salvadó","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Monica","surname":"Bulló","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Nancy","surname":"Babio","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Miguel

Healthy Older Adults: A Pilot Study","abstract":"Loss of muscle mass and strength are seemingly accepted as part of the ageing process, despite ultimately leading to the loss of independence.\n\n Resistance exercise is considered to be primary defence against loss of muscle function in older age, but it typically requires access to exercise equipment often in a gym environment.\n\n This pilot study aimed at examining the effect of a 28-day, unsupervised home-based exercise intervention on indices of leg strength and muscle size in healthy older adults.\n\n Twenty participants were randomly assigned to either maintain their habitual physical activity levels (Control; n=10; age, 74 (5) years; body mass, 26.3 (3.5)?kg/m2) or undertake “exercise snacks” twice daily (ES; n=10; age, 70 (4) years; body mass, 25.0 (3.4)?kg/m2).\n\n Both groups consumed 150?g of yogurt at their breakfast meal for the duration of the intervention.\n\n Sixty-second sit-to-stand score improved by 31% in ES, with no change in Control (p &lt; 0.01).\n\n Large effect sizes were observed for the difference in change scores between the groups for interpolated maximum leg pressing power (6% increase in ES) and thigh muscle cross-sectional area (2% increase in ES).\n\n The present pilot data suggest that exercise snacking might be a promising strategy to improve leg muscle function and size in older adults and that further investigation into zero-cost exercise strategies that allow high frequency of training is warranted.\n\n","id":"PMC6794984","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Oliver

Advancing Age on Human Skeletal Muscle Size and Strength; a Quantitative Review","abstract":"Changing demographics make it ever more important to understand the modifiable risk factors for disability and loss of independence with advancing age.\n For more than two decades there has been increasing interest in the role of sarcopenia, the age-related loss of muscle or lean mass, in curtailing active and healthy aging.\n There is now evidence to suggest that lack of strength, or dynapenia, is a more constant factor in compromised wellbeing in old age and it is apparent that the decline in muscle mass and the decline in strength can take quite different trajectories.\n This demands recognition of the concept of muscle quality; that is the force generating per capacity per unit cross-sectional area (CSA).\n An understanding of the impact of aging on skeletal muscle will require attention to both the changes in muscle size and the changes in muscle quality.\n The aim of this review is to present current knowledge of the decline in human muscle mass and strength with advancing age and the associated risk to health and survival and to review the underlying changes in muscle characteristics and the etiology of sarcopenia.\n Cross-sectional studies comparing young (18–45?years) and old (&gt;65?years) samples show dramatic variation based on the technique used and population studied.\n The median of values of rate of loss reported across studies is 0.47% per year in men and 0.37% per year in women.\n Longitudinal studies show that in people aged 75?years, muscle mass is lost at a rate of 0.64–0.70% per year in women and 0.80–00.98% per year in men.\n Strength is lost more rapidly.\n Longitudinal studies show that at age 75?years, strength is lost at a rate of 3–4% per year in men and 2.5–3% per year in women.\n Studies that assessed changes in mass and strength in the same sample report a loss of strength 2–5 times faster than loss of mass.\n Loss of strength is a more consistent risk for disability and death than is loss of muscle mass.\n","id":"PMC3429036","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"W.

activity is considered crucial in attenuating losses in strength and power associated with ageing.\n However, in well-functioning, active older adults the relationship between habitual physical activity and muscle function is surprisingly unclear.\n Leg press velocity, force, and power, were compared between 50 older and 30 younger healthy individuals, and associations with habitual physical activity explored.\n An incremental power test was performed on a pneumatic leg press, with theoretical maximum velocity, force, and power calculated.\n Vastus lateralis muscle thickness was measured by ultrasound, and participants wore a combined accelerometer and heart rate monitor for 6-days of free-living.\n Older individuals produced lower absolute maximum velocity, force, and power, than younger individuals.\n When accounting for smaller muscle size, older individual’s maximum force and power remained markedly lower.\n Both groups were active, however using age specific thresholds for classifying physical activity, the older individuals engaged in twice the amount of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity in comparison to the younger individuals.\n There were no associations between any characteristics of muscle function and physical activity.\n These data support that the ability to generate force and power deteriorates with age, however habitual physical activity levels

Positively Influences 24-h Muscle Protein Synthesis in Healthy Adults<","abstract":"The RDA for protein describes the quantity that should be consumed daily to meet population needs and to prevent deficiency.\n Protein consumption in many countries exceeds the RDA; however, intake is often skewed toward the evening meal, whereas breakfast is typically carbohydrate rich and low in protein.\n We examined the effects of protein distribution on 24-h skeletal muscle protein synthesis in healthy adult men and women (n = 8; age: 36.9 ± 3.1 y; BMI: 25.7 ± 0.8 kg/m2).\n By using a 7-d crossover feeding design with a 30-d washout period, we measured changes in muscle protein synthesis in response to isoenergetic and isonitrogenous diets with protein at breakfast, lunch, and dinner distributed evenly (EVEN; 31.5 ± 1.3, 29.9 ± 1.6, and 32.7 ± 1.6 g protein, respectively) or skewed (SKEW; 10.7 ± 0.8, 16.0 ± 0.5, and 63.4 ± 3.7 g protein, respectively).\n Over 24-h periods on days 1 and 7, venous blood samples and vastus lateralis muscle biopsy samples were obtained during primed (2.0 ?mol/kg) constant infusion [0.06 ?mol/(kg?min)] of l-[ring-13C6]phenylalanine.\n The 24-h mixed muscle protein fractional synthesis rate was 25% higher in the EVEN (0.075 ± 0.006%/h) vs.\n the SKEW (0.056 ± 0.006%/h) protein distribution groups (P = 0.003).\n This pattern was maintained after 7 d of habituation to each diet (EVEN vs.\n SKEW: 0.077 ± 0.006 vs.\n 0.056 ± 0.006%/h; P = 0.001).\n The consumption of a moderate amount of protein at each meal stimulated 24-h muscle protein synthesis more effectively than skewing protein intake toward the evening meal.\n","id":"PMC4018950","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Madonna

elevated (199%) above rest at 24 h only in 30FAIL.\n\n There was a significant increase in AktSer473 at 24h in all conditions (P?=?0.023) and mTORSer2448 phosphorylation at 4 h post-exercise (P?=?0.025).\n\n Phosporylation of Erk1/2Tyr202/204, p70S6KThr389, and 4E-BP1Thr37/46 increased significantly (P&lt;0.05) only in the 30FAIL condition at 4 h post-exercise, whereas, 4E-BP1Thr37/46 phosphorylation was greater 24 h after exercise than at rest in both 90FAIL (237%) and 30FAIL (312%) conditions.\n\n Pax7 mRNA expression increased at 24 h post-exercise (P?=?0.02) regardless of condition.\n\n The mRNA expression of MyoD and myogenin were consistently elevated in the 30FAIL condition.\n\n\nConclusions/Significance\nThese results suggest that low-load high volume resistance exercise is more effective in inducing acute muscle anabolism than high-load low volume or work matched resistance exercise modes.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2918506","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Nicholas A.","surname":"Burd","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Daniel W.

glycogen content","abstract":"Background\nUltrasound imaging is a valuable tool in exercise and sport science research, and has been used to visualize and track real-time movement of muscles and tendons, estimate hydration status in body tissues, and most recently, quantify skeletal muscle glycogen content.\n\n In this validation study, direct glycogen quantification from pre-and post-exercise muscle biopsy samples was compared with glycogen content estimates made through a portable, diagnostic high-frequency ultrasound and cloud-based software system (MuscleSound®, Denver, CO).\n\n\nMethods\nWell-trained cyclists (N?=?20, age 38.4?±?6.0 y, 351?±?57.6 wattsmax) participated in a 75-km cycling time trial on their own bicycles using CompuTrainer Pro Model 8001 trainers (RacerMate, Seattle, WA).\n\n Muscle biopsy samples and ultrasound measurements were acquired pre- and post-exercise.\n\n Specific locations on the vastus lateralis were marked, and a trained technician used a 12 MHz linear transducer and a standard diagnostic high resolution GE LOGIQ-e ultrasound machine (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI) to make three ultrasound measurements.\n\n Ultrasound images were pre-processed to isolate the muscle area under analysis, with the mean pixel intensity averaged from the three scans and scaled (0 to 100 scale) to create the glycogen score.\n\n Pre- and post-exercise muscle biopsy samples were acquired at the vastus lateralis location (2 cm apart) using the suction-modified percutaneous needle biopsy procedure, and analyzed for glycogen content.\n\n\nResults\nThe 20 cyclists completed the 75-km cycling time trial in 168?±?26.0 minutes at a power output of 193?±?57.8 watts (54.2?±?9.6% wattsmax).\n\n Muscle glycogen decreased 77.2?±?17.4%, with an absolute change of 71.4?±?23.1 mmol glycogen per kilogram of muscle.\n\n The MuscleSound® change score at the vastus lateralis site correlated highly with change in measured muscle glycogen content (R?=?0.92, P?&lt;?0.001).\n\n\nConclusions\nMuscleSound® change scores acquired from an average of three ultrasound scans at the vastus lateralis site correlated significantly with change in vastus lateralis muscle glycogen content.\n\n These data support the use of the MuscleSound® system for accurately and non-invasively estimating exercise-induced decreases in vastus lateralis skeletal muscle glycogen content.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4406335","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"David
