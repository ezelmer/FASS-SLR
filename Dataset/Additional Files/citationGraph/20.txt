Patient data were manually abstracted from electronic medical records.\n\n\nMain outcome measures\nCharacterization of patients, including demographics, presenting symptoms, comorbidities on presentation, hospital course, time to intubation, complications, mortality, and disposition.\n\n\nResults\nOf the first 1000 patients, 150 presented to the emergency department, 614 were admitted to hospital (not intensive care units), and 236 were admitted or transferred to intensive care units.\n\n The most common presenting symptoms were cough (732/1000), fever (728/1000), and dyspnea (631/1000).\n\n Patients in hospital, particularly those treated in intensive care units, often had baseline comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes, and obesity.\n\n Patients admitted to intensive care units were older, predominantly male (158/236, 66.9%), and had long lengths of stay (median 23 days, interquartile range 12-32 days); 78.0% (184/236) developed acute kidney injury and 35.2% (83/236) needed dialysis.\n\n Only 4.4% (6/136) of patients who required mechanical ventilation were first intubated more than 14 days after symptom onset.\n\n Time to intubation from symptom onset had a bimodal distribution, with modes at three to four days, and at nine days.\n\n As of 30 April, 90 patients remained in hospital and 211 had died in hospital.\n\n\nConclusions\nPatients admitted to hospital with covid-19 at this medical center faced major morbidity and mortality, with high rates of acute kidney injury and inpatient dialysis, prolonged intubations, and a bimodal distribution of time to intubation from symptom onset.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7256651","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Michael

Scarce resources allocation in the COVID-19 outbreak","abstract":"After initially emerging in China, the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak has advanced rapidly.\n The World Health Organization (WHO) has recently declared it a pandemic, with Europe becoming its new epicentre.\n Italy has so far been the most severely hit European country and demand for critical care in the northern region currently exceeds its supply.\n This raises significant ethical concerns, among which is the allocation of scarce resources.\n Professionals are considering the prioritisation of patients most likely to survive over those with remote chances, and this news has triggered an intense debate about the right of every individual to access healthcare.\n The proposed analysis suggests that the national emergency framework in which prioritisation criteria are currently enforced should not lead us to perceive scarce resources allocation as something new.\n From an ethical perspective, the novelty of the current emergency is not grounded in the devastating effects of scarce resources allocation, which is rife in recent and present clinical practice.\n Rather, it has to do with the extraordinarily high number of people who find themselves personally affected by the implications of scarce resources allocation and who suddenly realise that the principle of ‘equals should be treated equally’ may no longer be applicable.\n Along with the need to allocate appropriate additional financial resources to support the healthcare system, and thus to mitigate the scarcity of resources, the analysis insists on the relevance of a medical ethics perspective that does not place the burden of care and choice solely on physicians.\n","id":"PMC7242866","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Chiara","surname":"Mannelli","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMp2005689","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The toughest triage:allocating ventilators in a pandemic","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1001/jama.2020.5046","date":"1970-01-01","title":"A framework for rationing ventilators and critical care beds during the COVID-19 pandemic","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1136/medethics-2020-106332","date":"2020-04-20","title":"Who gets the ventilator?

China","abstract":"Background\nSince December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and

diffuse alveolar damage with severe capillary congestion and variegated findings in lungs and other organs suggesting vascular dysfunction","abstract":"Aims\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID?19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS?CoV?2), has rapidly evolved into a sweeping pandemic.\n\n Its major manifestation is in the respiratory tract, and the general extent of organ involvement and the microscopic changes in the lungs remain insufficiently characterised.\n\n Autopsies are essential to elucidate COVID?19?associated organ alterations.\n\n\nMethods and results\nThis article reports the autopsy findings of 21 COVID?19 patients hospitalised at the University Hospital Basel and at the Cantonal Hospital Baselland, Switzerland.\n\n An in?corpore technique was performed to ensure optimal staff safety.\n\n The primary cause of death was respiratory failure with exudative diffuse alveolar damage and massive capillary congestion, often accompanied by microthrombi despite anticoagulation.\n\n Ten cases showed superimposed bronchopneumonia.\n\n Further findings included pulmonary embolism (n = 4), alveolar haemorrhage (n = 3), and vasculitis (n = 1).\n\n Pathologies in other organ systems were predominantly attributable to shock; three patients showed signs of generalised and five of pulmonary thrombotic microangiopathy.\n\n Six patients were diagnosed with senile cardiac amyloidosis upon autopsy.\n\n Most patients suffered from one or more comorbidities (hypertension, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes mellitus).\n\n Additionally, there was an overall predominance of males and individuals with blood group A (81% and 65%, respectively).\n\n All relevant histological slides are linked as open?source scans in supplementary files.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis study provides an overview of postmortem findings in COVID?19 cases, implying that hypertensive, elderly, obese, male individuals with severe cardiovascular comorbidities as well as those with blood group A may have a lower threshold of tolerance for COVID?19. This provides a pathophysiological explanation for higher mortality rates among these patients.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7496150","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Thomas","surname":"Menter","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jasmin

cardiovascular disease (OR 2.58; 95% CI 1.07–6.25; p 0.03), and C-reactive protein levels (per-point increase OR 1.009; 95% CI 1.004–1.014; p 0.001) were independent risk factors for all-cause in-hospital mortality.\n\n\nConclusions\nCOVID-19 mainly affected elderly patients with predisposing conditions and caused severe illness, frequently requiring non-invasive respiratory support or ICU admission.\n\n Despite supportive care, COVID-19 remains associated with a substantial risk of all-cause in-hospital mortality.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7428680","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Antonio","surname":"Vena","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Daniele

skilled nursing facility in King County, Washington, Public Health–Seattle and King County, aided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, launched a case investigation, contact tracing, quarantine of exposed persons, isolation of confirmed and suspected cases, and on-site enhancement of infection prevention and control.\n\n\nResults\nAs of March 18, a total of 167 confirmed cases of Covid-19 affecting 101 residents, 50 health care personnel, and 16 visitors were found to be epidemiologically linked to the facility.\n\n Most cases among residents included respiratory illness

analysis","abstract":"Background\nIn the face of rapidly changing data, a range of case fatality ratio estimates for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been produced that differ substantially in magnitude.\n\n We aimed to provide robust estimates, accounting for censoring and ascertainment biases.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected individual-case data for patients who died from COVID-19 in Hubei, mainland China (reported by national and provincial health commissions to Feb 8, 2020), and for cases outside of mainland China (from government or ministry of health websites and media reports for 37 countries, as well as Hong Kong and Macau, until Feb 25, 2020).\n\n These individual-case data were used to estimate the time between onset of symptoms and outcome (death or discharge from hospital).\n\n We next obtained age-stratified estimates of the case fatality ratio by relating the aggregate distribution of cases to the observed cumulative deaths in China, assuming a constant attack rate by age and adjusting for demography and age-based and location-based under-ascertainment.\n\n We also estimated the case fatality ratio from individual line-list data on 1334 cases identified outside of mainland China.\n\n Using data on the prevalence of PCR-confirmed cases in international residents repatriated from China, we obtained age-stratified estimates of the infection fatality ratio.\n\n Furthermore, data on age-stratified severity in a subset of 3665 cases from China were used to estimate the proportion of infected individuals who are likely to require hospitalisation.\n\n\nFindings\nUsing data on 24 deaths that occurred in mainland China and 165 recoveries outside of China, we estimated the mean duration from onset of symptoms to death to be 17·8 days (95% credible interval [CrI] 16·9–19·2) and to hospital discharge to be 24·7 days (22·9–28·1).\n\n In all laboratory confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases from mainland China (n=70?117), we estimated a crude case fatality ratio (adjusted for censoring) of 3·67% (95% CrI 3·56–3·80).\n\n However, after further adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment, we obtained a best estimate of the case fatality ratio in China of 1·38% (1·23–1·53), with substantially higher ratios in older age groups (0·32% [0·27–0·38] in those aged &lt;60 years vs 6·4% [5·7–7·2] in those aged ?60 years), up to 13·4% (11·2–15·9) in those aged 80 years or older.\n\n Estimates of case fatality ratio from international cases stratified by age were consistent with those from China (parametric estimate 1·4% [0·4–3·5] in those aged &lt;60 years [n=360] and 4·5% [1·8–11·1] in those aged ?60 years [n=151]).\n\n Our estimated overall infection fatality ratio for China was 0·66% (0·39–1·33), with an increasing profile with age.\n\n Similarly, estimates of the proportion of infected individuals likely to be hospitalised increased with age up to a maximum of 18·4% (11·0–37·6) in those aged 80 years or older.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThese early estimates give an indication of the fatality ratio across the spectrum of COVID-19 disease and show a strong age gradient in risk of death.\n\n\nFunding\nUK

of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study","abstract":"Background\nSince December, 2019, Wuhan, China, has experienced an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).\n\n Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (?18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.\n\n\nFindings\n191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital.\n\n 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients).\n\n Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·03–1·17, per year increase; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·61–12·23; p&lt;0·0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL (18·42, 2·64–128·55; p=0·0033) on admission.\n\n Median duration of viral shedding was 20·0 days (IQR 17·0–24·0) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors.\n\n The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage.\n\n Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.\n\n\nFunding\nChinese Academy of Medical Sciences Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences; National Science Grant for Distinguished Young Scholars; National Key Research and Development Program of China; The Beijing Science and Technology Project; and Major Projects of National Science and Technology on New Drug Creation and Development.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7270627","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Fei","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ronghui","surname":"Du","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guohui","surname":"Fan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhibo","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jie","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yeming","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoying","surname":"Gu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lulu","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xudong","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiuyang","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shengjin","surname":"Tu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hua","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Cao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2004500","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Covid-19 in Critically Ill Patients in the Seattle Region — Case Series","abstract":"Background\nCommunity transmission of coronavirus 2019 (Covid-19) was detected in the state of Washington in February 2020.\nMethods\nWe identified patients from nine Seattle-area hospitals who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with confirmed infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).\n\n Clinical data were obtained through review of medical records.\n\n The data reported here are those available through March 23, 2020.

of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in

associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.\n\n Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source.\n\n No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.\n\n\nFindings\nFrom Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\n Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members.\n\n None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital.\n\n Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure.\n\n They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset.\n\n They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities.\n\n Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.\n\n The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.\n\n\nFunding\nThe Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui

Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.\n\n\nFindings\n191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital.\n\n 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients).\n\n Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·03–1·17, per year increase; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·61–12·23; p&lt;0·0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL (18·42, 2·64–128·55; p=0·0033) on admission.\n\n Median duration of viral shedding was 20·0 days (IQR 17·0–24·0) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors.\n\n The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 ?g/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage.\n\n Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.\n\n\nFunding\nChinese Academy of Medical Sciences Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences; National Science Grant for Distinguished Young Scholars; National Key Research and Development Program of China; The Beijing Science and Technology Project; and Major Projects of National Science and Technology on New Drug Creation and Development.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7270627","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Fei","surname":"Zhou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ronghui","surname":"Du","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guohui","surname":"Fan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ying","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhibo","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jie","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yeming","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Song","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaoying","surname":"Gu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lulu","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hui","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xudong","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiuyang","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shengjin","surname":"Tu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hua","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Cao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"10.1001/jama.2020.1097","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The novel coronavirus originating in Wuhan, China: challenges for global health governance","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1101/2020.02.07.937862","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus: the species and its viruses:a statement of the Coronavirus Study Group","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Short term outcome and risk factors for adverse clinical outcomes in adults with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2001316","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Early Transmission Dynamics in Wuhan, China, of Novel Coronavirus–Infected Pneumonia","abstract":"Background\nThe initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020.

SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xiaobo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiqian","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huaqing","surname":"Shu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jia'an","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yongran","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lu","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhui","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Minghao","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yaxin","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shangwen","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaojing","surname":"Zou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shiying","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"You","surname":"Shang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Middle

data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and

Data on the epidemiology, clinical course, and outcomes of critically ill patients with COVID-19 in this setting are needed.\n\n\nMethods\nThis prospective observational cohort study took place at two NewYork-Presbyterian hospitals affiliated with Columbia University Irving Medical Center in northern Manhattan.\n\n We prospectively identified adult patients (aged ?18 years) admitted to both hospitals from March 2 to April 1, 2020, who were diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and were critically ill with acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure, and collected clinical, biomarker, and treatment data.\n\n The primary outcome was the rate of in-hospital death.\n\n Secondary outcomes included frequency and duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, frequency of vasopressor use and renal replacement therapy, and time to in-hospital clinical deterioration following admission.\n\n The relation between clinical risk factors, biomarkers, and in-hospital mortality was modelled using Cox proportional hazards regression.\n\n Follow-up time was right-censored on April 28, 2020 so that each patient had at least 28 days of observation.\n\n\nFindings\nBetween March 2 and April 1, 2020, 1150 adults were admitted to both hospitals with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, of which 257 (22%) were critically ill.\n\n The median age of patients was 62 years (IQR 51–72), 171 (67%) were men.\n\n 212 (82%) patients had at least one chronic illness, the most common of which were hypertension (162 [63%]) and diabetes (92 [36%]).\n\n 119 (46%) patients had obesity.\n\n As of April 28, 2020, 101 (39%) patients had died and 94 (37%) remained hospitalised.\n\n 203 (79%) patients received invasive mechanical ventilation for a median of 18 days (IQR 9–28), 170 (66%) of 257 patients received vasopressors and 79 (31%) received renal replacement therapy.\n\n The median time to in-hospital deterioration was 3 days (IQR 1–6).\n\n In the multivariable Cox model, older age (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1·31 [1·09–1·57] per 10-year increase), chronic cardiac disease (aHR 1·76 [1·08–2·86]), chronic pulmonary disease (aHR 2·94 [1·48–5·84]), higher concentrations of interleukin-6 (aHR 1·11 [95%CI 1·02–1·20] per decile increase), and higher concentrations of D-dimer (aHR 1·10 [1·01–1·19] per decile increase) were independently associated with in-hospital mortality.\n\n\nInterpretation\nCritical illness among patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in New York City is common and associated with a high frequency of invasive mechanical ventilation, extrapulmonary organ dysfunction, and substantial in-hospital mortality.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, National Institutes of Health, and the Columbia University Irving Institute for Clinical and Translational Research.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7237188","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Matthew J","surname":"Cummings","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Matthew R","surname":"Baldwin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Darryl","surname":"Abrams","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Samuel D","surname":"Jacobson","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Benjamin J","surname":"Meyer","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Elizabeth M","surname":"Balough","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Justin G","surname":"Aaron","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jan","surname":"Claassen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"LeRoy E","surname":"Rabbani","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jonathan","surname":"Hastie","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Beth R","surname":"Hochman","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"John","surname":"Salazar-Schicchi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Natalie H","surname":"Yip","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Daniel","surname":"Brodie","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Max R","surname":"O'Donnell","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}],"References depth 2":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Petrilli CM, Jones SA, Yang J, et al.

this study was to identify influenza-specific factors associated with ICU admission and mortality.\n\n Furthermore, influenza-specific pulmonary bacterial, fungal and viral co-infections were investigated.\n\n\nMethods\n199 influenza patients, admitted to two academic hospitals in the Netherlands between 01-10-2015 and 01-04-2016 were investigated of which 45/199 were admitted to the ICU.\n\n\nResults\nA history of Obstructive/Central Sleep Apnea Syndrome, myocardial infarction, dyspnea, influenza type A, BMI?&gt;?30, the development of renal failure and bacterial and fungal co-infections, were observed more frequently in patients who were admitted to the ICU, compared with patients at the normal ward.\n\n Co-infections were evident in 55.6% of ICU-admitted patients, compared with 20.1% of patients at the normal ward, mainly caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Aspergillus fumigatus.\n\n Non-survivors suffered from diabetes mellitus and (pre-existent) renal failure more often.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe current study indicates that a history of OSAS/CSAS, myocardial infarction and BMI?&gt;?30 might be related to ICU admission in influenza patients.\n\n Second, ICU patients develop more pulmonary co-infections.\n\n Last, (pre-existent) renal failure and diabetes mellitus are more often observed in non-survivors.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7125534","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"M.C.","surname":"Beumer","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"R.M.","surname":"Koch","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"D.","surname":"van

creating much confusion and making comparisons difficult.\n\n Similarly, strong debate exists on the validity and clinical relevance of animal models of ARF; on choices of fluid management and of end-points for trials of new interventions in this field; and on how information technology can be used to assist this process.\n\n Accordingly, we sought to review the available evidence, make recommendations and delineate key questions for future studies.\n\n\nMethods\nWe undertook a systematic review of the literature using Medline and PubMed searches.\n\n We determined a list of key questions and convened a 2-day consensus conference to develop summary statements via a series of alternating breakout and plenary sessions.\n\n In these sessions, we identified supporting evidence and generated recommendations and/or directions for future research.\n\n\nResults\nWe found sufficient consensus on 47 questions to allow the development of recommendations.\n\n Importantly, we were

Critically Ill Patients","abstract":"Objective\nTo identify the associations between the duration of endotracheal intubation and developing post-extubational supraglottic and infraglottic aspiration (PEA) and subsequent aspiration pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nThis was a retrospective observational study from January 2009 to November 2014 of all adult patients who had non-neurologic critical illness, required endotracheal intubation and were referred for videofluoroscopic swallowing study.\n\n Demographic information, intensive care unit (ICU) admission diagnosis, severity of critical illness, duration of endotracheal intubation, length of stay in ICU, presence of PEA and severity of dysphagia were reviewed.\n\n\nResults\nSeventy-four patients were enrolled and their PEA frequency was 59%.\n\n Patients with PEA had significantly longer endotracheal intubation durations than did those without (median [interquartile range]: 15 [9-21] vs.\n\n 10 [6-15] days; p=0.02).\n\n In multivariate logistic regression analysis, the endotracheal intubation duration was significantly associated with PEA (odds ratio, 1.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.18; p=0.04).\n\n Spearman correlation analysis of intubation duration and dysphagia severity showed a positive linear association (r=0.282, p=0.02).\n\n The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) of endotracheal intubation duration for developing PEA and aspiration pneumonia were 0.665 (95% CI, 0.542-0.788; p=0.02) and 0.727 (95% CI, 0.614-0.840; p=0.001), respectively.\n\n\nConclusion\nIn non-neurologic critically ill patients, the duration of endotracheal intubation was independently associated with PEA development.\n\n Additionally, the duration was positively correlated with dysphagia severity and may be helpful for identifying patients who require a swallowing evaluation after extubation.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4654083","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Min Jung","surname":"Kim","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yun

Sociodemographic and geospatial data as well as, clinical management, respiratory failure, and patient mortality were obtained via the real-time registry.\n\n Data on COVID-19 specific care was extracted by retrospective chart review.\n\n\nResults\nCOVID-19 testing was performed on 900 symptomatic patients, comprising 3.4% of the Yale Heart Failure Registry (N = 26,703).\n\n Overall, 206 (23%) were COVID- 19+.\n\n As compared to COVID-19-, these patients were more likely to be older, black, have hypertension, coronary artery disease, and were less likely to be on renin angiotensin blockers (P&lt;0.05, all).\n\n COVID-19- patients tended to be more diffusely spread across the state whereas COVID-19+ were largely clustered around urban centers.\n\n 20% of COVID-19+ patients died, and age was associated with increased risk of death [OR 1.92 95% CI (1.33–2.78); P&lt;0.001].\n\n Among COVID-19+ patients who were ?85 years of age rates of hospitalization were 87%, rates of death 36%, and continuing hospitalization 62% at time of manuscript preparation.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn this real-world snapshot of COVID-19 infection among a large cohort of heart failure patients, we found that a small proportion had undergone testing.\n\n Patients found to be COVID-19+ tended to be black with multiple comorbidities and clustered around lower socioeconomic status communities.\n\n Elderly COVID-19+ patients were very likely to be admitted to the hospital and experience high rates of mortality.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7526909","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC_CROSSREF","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"César","surname":"Caraballo","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Megan","surname":"McCullough","email":"NULL","contributions":"4"},{"firstname":"Megan","surname":"McCullough","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Michael A.","surname":"Fuery","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Fouad","surname":"Chouairi","email":"NULL","contributions":"4"},{"firstname":"Fouad","surname":"Chouairi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Craig","surname":"Keating","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Neal G.","surname":"Ravindra","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"P.

in China","abstract":"Background\nSince December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without

By extracting and analyzing all available published clinical data, we identified several major clinical characteristics associated with increased disease severity and mortality among patients with COVID-19. Specifically, preexisting chronic conditions such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes are strongly associated with an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19; surprisingly, however, we found no correlation between chronic liver disease and increased disease severity.\n In addition, we found that both acute cardiac injury and acute kidney injury are highly correlated with an increased risk of COVID-19-related mortality.\n Given the high risk of comorbidity and the high mortality rate associated with tissue damage, organ function should be monitored closely in patients diagnosed with COVID-19, and this approach should be included when establishing new guidelines for managing these high-risk patients.\n Moreover, additional clinical data are needed in order to determine whether a supportive therapy can help mitigate the development of severe, potentially fatal complications, and further studies are needed to identify the pathophysiology and the mechanism underlying this novel coronavirus-associated infectious disease.\n Taken together, these findings provide new insights regarding clinical strategies for improving the management and outcome of patients with COVID-19.","id":"PMC7187729","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xinhui","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xuexian","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Xuexian","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhaoxian","surname":"Cai","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Zhaoxian","surname":"Cai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaotian","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiaotong","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Xiaotong","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Junxia","surname":"Min","email":"junxiamin@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Junxia","surname":"Min","email":"junxiamin@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fudi","surname":"Wang","email":"fwang@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Fudi","surname":"Wang","email":"fwang@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2002032","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China","abstract":"Background\nSince December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020.

2019 (Covid-19) has not been well studied.\n\n\nMethods\nWe carried out a population-based case–control study in the Lombardy region of Italy.\n\n A total of 6272 case patients in whom infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was confirmed between February 21 and March 11, 2020, were matched to 30,759 beneficiaries of the Regional Health Service (controls) according to sex, age, and municipality of residence.\n\n Information about the use of selected drugs and patients’ clinical profiles was obtained from regional databases of health care use.\n\n Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for associations between drugs and infection, with adjustment for confounders, were estimated by means of logistic regression.\n\n\nResults\nAmong both case patients and controls, the mean (±SD) age was 68±13 years, and 37% were women.\n\n The use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs was more common among case patients than among controls, as was the use of other antihypertensive and non-antihypertensive drugs, and case patients had a worse clinical profile.\n\n Use of ARBs or ACE inhibitors did not show any association with Covid-19 among case patients overall (adjusted odds ratio, 0.95 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.86 to 1.05] for ARBs and 0.96 [95% CI, 0.87 to 1.07] for ACE inhibitors) or among patients who had a severe or fatal course of the disease (adjusted odds ratio, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.63 to 1.10] for ARBs and 0.91 [95% CI, 0.69 to 1.21] for ACE inhibitors), and no association between these variables was found according to sex.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn this large, population-based study, the use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs was more frequent among patients with Covid-19 than among controls because of their higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease.\n\n However, there was no evidence that ACE inhibitors or ARBs affected the risk of

inhibitors might influence the severity of COVID-19. We aimed to evaluate whether continuing versus discontinuing renin–angiotensin system inhibitors (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers) affects outcomes in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19.\nMethods\nThe REPLACE COVID trial was a prospective, randomised, open-label trial done at 20 large referral hospitals in seven countries worldwide.\n\n Eligible participants were aged 18 years and older who were admitted to hospital with COVID-19 and were receiving a renin–angiotensin system inhibitor before admission.\n\n Individuals with contraindications to continuation or discontinuation of renin–angiotensin system inhibitor therapy were excluded.\n\n Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to continuation or discontinuation of their renin–angiotensin system inhibitor using permuted block randomisation, with allocation concealed using a secure web-based randomisation system.\n\n The primary outcome was a global rank score in which participants were ranked across four hierarchical tiers incorporating time to death, duration of mechanical ventilation, time on renal replacement or vasopressor therapy, and multiorgan dysfunction during the hospitalisation.\n\n Primary analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population.\n\n The REPLACE COVID trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.\n\ngov, NCT04338009.\n\n\nFindings\nBetween March 31 and Aug 20, 2020, 152 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to either continue or discontinue renin–angiotensin system inhibitor therapy (continuation group n=75; discontinuation group n=77).\n\n Mean age of participants was 62 years (SD 12), 68 (45%) were female, mean body-mass index was 33 kg/m2 (SD 8), and 79 (52%) had diabetes.\n\n Compared with discontinuation of renin–angiotensin system inhibitors, continuation had no effect on the global rank score (median rank 73 [IQR 40–110] for continuation vs 81 [38–117] for discontinuation; ?-coefficient 8 [95% CI ?13 to 29]).\n\n There were 16 (21%) of 75 participants in the continuation arm versus 14 (18%) of 77 in the discontinuation arm who required intensive care unit admission or invasive mechanical ventilation, and 11 (15%) of 75 participants in the continuation group versus ten (13%) of 77 in the discontinuation group died.\n\n 29 (39%) participants in the continuation group and 28 (36%) participants in the discontinuation group had at least one adverse event (?2 test of adverse events between treatment groups p=0·77).\n\n There was no difference in

enzyme 2, which can be upregulated by inhibitors of the renin–angiotensin system (RAS).\n\n We aimed to test our hypothesis that discontinuation of chronic treatment with ACE-inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) mitigates the course o\f recent-onset COVID-19.\nMethods\nACEI-COVID was a parallel group, randomised, controlled, open-label trial done at 35 centres in Austria and Germany.\n\n Patients aged 18 years and older were enrolled if they presented with recent symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and were chronically treated with ACEIs or ARBs.\n\n Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to discontinuation or continuation of RAS inhibition for 30 days.\n\n Primary outcome was the maximum sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score within 30 days, where death was scored with the maximum achievable SOFA score.\n\n Secondary endpoints were area under the death-adjusted SOFA score (AUCSOFA), mean SOFA score, admission to the intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, and death.\n\n Analyses were done on a modified intention-to-treat basis.\n\n This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.\n\ngov, NCT04353596.\n\n\nFindings\nBetween April 20, 2020, and Jan 20, 2021, 204 patients (median age 75 years [IQR 66–80], 37% females) were randomly assigned to discontinue (n=104) or continue (n=100) RAS inhibition.\n\n Within 30 days, eight (8%) of 104 died in the discontinuation group and 12 (12%) of 100 patients died in the continuation group (p=0·42).\n\n There was no significant difference in the primary endpoint between the discontinuation and continuation group (median [IQR] maximum SOFA score 0·00 (0·00–2·00) vs 1·00 (0·00–3·00); p=0·12).\n\n Discontinuation was associated with a significantly lower AUCSOFA (0·00 [0·00–9·25] vs 3·50 [0·00–23·50]; p=0·040), mean SOFA score (0·00 [0·00–0·31] vs 0·12 [0·00–0·78]; p=0·040), and 30-day SOFA score (0·00 [10–90th percentile, 0·00–1·20] vs 0·00 [0·00–24·00]; p=0·023).\n\n At 30 days, 11 (11%) in the discontinuation group and 23 (23%) in the continuation group had signs of organ dysfunction (SOFA score ?1) or were dead (p=0·017).\n\n There were no

Using data from 228,722 Veterans with a history of hypertension who received COVID-19 testing at the VA, we investigated whether the use of ACEI or ARB over the two years prior to the index date was associated with increased odds of (1) a positive COVID-19 test, and (2) a severe outcome (hospitalization, mortality, and use of intensive care unit (ICU) and/or mechanical ventilation) among COVID-19-positive patients.\n\n We used logistic regression with and without propensity score weighting (PSW) to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for the association between ACEI/ARB use and a positive COVID-19 test result.\n\n The association between medication use and COVID-19 outcome severity was examined using multinomial logistic regression comparing participants who were not hospitalized to participants who were hospitalized, were admitted to the ICU, used a mechanical ventilator, or died.\n\n All models were adjusted for relevant covariates, including demographics (age, sex, race, ethnicity), selected comorbidities, and the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI).\n\n\nResults\nThe use of ACEI significantly decreased the odds of a positive COVID-19 test among Veterans with hypertension (OR = 0.917, (0.887, 0.948) and OR = 0.926, (0.894, 0.958) with PSW).\n\n The use of ACEI, but not of ARB, was also associated with significantly increased odds of using mechanical ventilators (OR = 1.265, (1.010, 1.584) and OR = 1.210, (1.053, 1.39) with PSW) among all COVID-19 inpatients compared to outpatients.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn this study of Veterans with hypertension, ACEI was significantly associated with decreased odds of testing positive for COVID-19.

in China","abstract":"Background\nSince December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7092819","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Wei-jie","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng-yi","surname":"Ni","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng-yi","surname":"Ni","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yu","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wen-hua","surname":"Liang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chun-quan","surname":"Ou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jian-xing","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Shan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chun-liang","surname":"Lei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"David

Extensive Cross-Neutralization between Pandemic and Seasonal A/H1N1 Influenza Viruses Using a Pseudotype Neutralization Assay","abstract":"Background\nCross-immunity between seasonal and pandemic A/H1N1 influenza viruses remains uncertain.\n\n In particular, the extent that previous infection or vaccination by seasonal A/H1N1 viruses can elicit protective immunity against pandemic A/H1N1 is unclear.\n\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nNeutralizing titers against seasonal A/H1N1 (A/Brisbane/59/2007) and against pandemic A/H1N1 (A/California/04/2009) were measured using an HIV-1-based pseudovirus neutralization assay.\n\n Using this highly sensitive assay, we found that a large fraction of subjects who had never been exposed to pandemic A/H1N1 express high levels of pandemic A/H1N1 neutralizing titers.\n\n A significant correlation was seen between neutralization of pandemic A/H1N1 and neutralization of a standard seasonal A/H1N1 strain.\n\n Significantly higher pandemic A/H1N1 neutralizing titers were measured in subjects who had received vaccination against seasonal influenza in 2008–2009. Higher pandemic neutralizing titers were also measured in subjects over 60 years of age.\n\n\nConclusions/Significance\nOur findings reveal that the extent of protective cross-immunity between seasonal and pandemic A/H1N1 influenza viruses may be more important than previously estimated.\n\n This cross-immunity could provide a possible explanation of the relatively mild profile of the recent influenza pandemic.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2882952","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Béatrice","surname":"Labrosse","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Mathieu","surname":"Tourdjman","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Raphaël","surname":"Porcher","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jérôme","surname":"LeGoff","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xavier","surname":"de Lamballerie","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"François","surname":"Simon","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jean-Michel","surname":"Molina","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"François","surname":"Clavel","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Linqi","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Linqi","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0009214","date":"2010-01-25","title":"Novel Virus Influenza A (H1N1sw) in South-Eastern France, April-August 2009","abstract":"Background\nIn April 2009, the first cases of pandemic (H1N1)-2009 influenza [H1N1sw] virus were detected in France.\n\n Virological surveillance was undertaken in reference laboratories of the seven French Defence Zones.\n\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nWe report results of virological analyses performed in the Public Hospitals of Marseille during the first months of the outbreak.\n\n (i) Nasal swabs were tested using rapid influenza diagnostic test (RIDT) and two RT-PCR assays.\n\n Epidemiological characteristics of the 99 first suspected cases were analyzed, including detection of influenza virus and 18 other respiratory viruses.\n\n During three months, a total of 1,815 patients were tested (including 236 patients infected H1N1sw virus) and distribution in age groups and results of RIDT were analyzed.\n\n (ii) 600 sera received before April 2009 and randomly selected from in-patients were tested by a standard hemagglutination inhibition assay for antibody to the novel H1N1sw virus.\n\n (iii) One early (May 2009) and one late (July 2009) viral isolates were characterized by sequencing the complete hemagglutinine and neuraminidase genes.\n\n (iiii) Epidemiological characteristics of a cluster of cases that occurred in July 2009 in a summer camp were analyzed.\n\n\nConclusions/Significance\nThis study presents new virological and epidemiological data regarding infection by the pandemic A/H1N1 virus in Europe.\n\n Distribution in age groups was found to be similar to that previously reported for seasonal H1N1. The first seroprevalence data made available for a European population suggest a previous exposure of individuals over 40 years old to influenza viruses antigenically related to the pandemic (H1N1)-2009 virus.\n\n Genomic analysis indicates that strains harbouring a new amino-acid pattern in the neuraminidase gene appeared secondarily and tended to supplant the first strains.\n\n Finally, in contrast with previous reports, our data support the use of RIDT for the detection of infection in children, especially in the context of the investigation of grouped cases.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2822845","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Antoine","surname":"Nougairède","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Laetitia","surname":"Ninove","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Christine","surname":"Zandotti","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Nicolas","surname":"Salez","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Karine","surname":"Mantey","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Noémie","surname":"Resseguier","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Céline","surname":"Gazin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Didier","surname":"Raoult","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rémi

including hand washing and use of hand sanitizer, have been recommended to mitigate the transmission of influenza, but limited information is available regarding schools' ability to implement these NPIs during an influenza outbreak.\n\n We evaluated implementation of NPIs during fall 2009 in response to H1N1 pandemic influenza (pH1N1) by New York City (NYC) public schools.\n\n\nMethods\nFrom January 25 through February 9, 2010, an online survey was sent to all the 1,632 NYC public schools and principals were asked to participate in the survey or to designate a school nurse or other school official with knowledge of school policies and characteristics to do so.\n\n\nResults\nOf 1,633 schools, 376(23%) accessed and completed the survey.\n\n Nearly all respondents (99%) implemented at least two NPIs.\n\n Schools that had a Flu Response Team (FRT) as a part of school emergency preparedness plan were more likely to implement the NPI guidelines recommended by NYC public health officials than schools that did not have a FRT.\n\n Designation of a room for isolating ill students, for example, was more common in schools with a FRT (72%) than those without (53%) (p&lt;0.001).\n\n\nConclusions\nImplementing an NPI program in a large school system to mitigate the effects of an influenza outbreak is feasible, but there is potential need for additional resources in some schools to increase capacity and adherence to all recommendations.\n\n Public health influenza-preparedness plans should include school preparedness planning and FRTs.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3546112","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Simon

systems improvement analysis","abstract":"Background\nSchool closure was employed as a non-pharmaceutical intervention against pandemic 2009 H1N1, particularly during the first wave.\n\n More than 700 schools in the United States were closed.\n\n However, closure decisions reflected significant variation in rationales, decision triggers, and authority for closure.\n\n This variability presents the opportunity for improved efficiency and decision-making.\n\n\nMethods\nWe identified media reports relating to school closure as a response to 2009 H1N1 by monitoring high-profile sources and searching Lexis-Nexis and Google news alerts, and reviewed reports for key themes.\n\n News stories were supplemented by observing conference calls and meetings with health department and school officials, and by discussions with decision-makers and community members.\n\n\nResults\nThere was significant variation in the stated goal of closure decision, including limiting community spread of the virus, protecting particularly vulnerable students, and responding to staff shortages or student absenteeism.\n\n Because the goal of closure is relevant to its timing, nature, and duration, unclear rationales for closure can challenge its effectiveness.\n\n There was also significant variation in the decision-making authority to close schools in different jurisdictions, which, in some instances, was reflected in open disagreement between school and public health officials.\n\n Finally, decision-makers did not appear to expect the level of scientific uncertainty encountered early in the pandemic, and they often expressed significant frustration over changing CDC guidance.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe use of school closure as a public health response to epidemic disease can be improved by ensuring that officials clarify the goals of closure and tailor closure decisions to those goals.\n\n Additionally, authority to close schools should be clarified in advance, and decision-makers should expect to encounter uncertainty disease emergencies unfold and plan accordingly.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3039590","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Tamar","surname":"Klaiman","email":"tamar.klaiman@jefferson.edu","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"John

functions for identifying threats to the health of a community.\n\n Very little is known about how these functions are conducted at the local level.\n\n The purpose of the Epidemiology Networks in Action (EpiNet) Study was to describe the epidemiology and surveillance response to the 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) by city and county health departments in the San Francisco Bay Area in California.\n\n The study also documented lessons learned from the response in order to strengthen future public health preparedness and response planning efforts in the region.\n\n\nMethods\nIn order to characterize the epidemiology and surveillance response, we conducted key informant interviews with public health professionals from twelve local health departments in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\n In order to contextualize aspects of organizational response and performance, we recruited two types of key informants: public health professionals who were involved with the epidemiology and surveillance response for each jurisdiction, as well as the health officer or his/her designee responsible for H1N1 response activities.\n\n Information about the organization, data sources for situation awareness, decision-making, and issues related to surge capacity, continuity of operations, and sustainability were collected during the key informant interviews.\n\n Content and interpretive analyses were conducted using ATLAS.\n\nti software.\n\n\nResults\nThe study found that disease investigations were important in the first months of the pandemic, often requiring additional staff support and sometimes forcing other public health activities to be put on hold.\n\n We also found that while the Incident Command System (ICS) was used by all participating agencies to manage the response, the manner in which it was implemented and utilized varied.\n\n Each local health department (LHD) in the study collected epidemiologic data from a variety of sources, but only case reports (including hospitalized and fatal cases) and laboratory testing data were used by all organizations.\n\n While almost every LHD attempted to collect school absenteeism data, many respondents reported problems in collecting and analyzing these data.\n\n Laboratory capacity to test influenza specimens often aided an LHD’s ability to conduct disease investigations and implement control measures, but the ability to test specimens varied across the region and even well-equipped laboratories exceeded their capacity.\n\n As a whole, the health jurisdictions in the region communicated regularly about key decision-making (continued on next page) (continued from previous page) related to the response, and prior regional collaboration on pandemic influenza planning helped to prepare the region for the novel H1N1 influenza pandemic.\n\n The study did find, however, that many respondents (including the majority of epidemiologists interviewed) desired an increase in regional communication about epidemiology and surveillance issues.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe study collected information about the epidemiology and surveillance response among LHDs in the San Francisco Bay Area that has implications for public health preparedness and emergency response training, public health best practices, regional public health collaboration, and a perceived need for information sharing.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3681650","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Wayne

variations in legal authority and plan criteria can alter the impact","abstract":"Background\nStates’ pandemic influenza plans and school closure statutes are intended to guide state and local officials, but most faced a great deal of uncertainty during the 2009 influenza H1N1 epidemic.\n\n Questions remained about whether, when, and for how long to close schools and about which agencies and officials had legal authority over school closures.\n\n\nMethods\nThis study began with analysis of states’ school-closure statutes and pandemic influenza plans to identify the variations among them.\n\n An agent-based model of one state was used to represent as constants a population’s demographics, commuting patterns, work and school attendance, and community mixing patterns while repeated simulations explored the effects of variations in school closure authority, duration, closure thresholds, and reopening criteria.\n\n\nResults\nThe results show no basis on which to justify statewide rather than school-specific or community-specific authority for school closures.\n\n Nor do these simulations offer evidence to require school closures promptly at the earliest stage of an epidemic.\n\n More important are criteria based on monitoring of local case incidence and on authority to sustain closure periods sufficiently to achieve epidemic mitigation.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis agent-based simulation suggests several ways to improve statutes and influenza plans.\n\n First, school closure should remain available to state and local authorities as an influenza mitigation strategy.\n\n Second, influenza plans need not necessarily specify the threshold for school closures but should clearly define provisions for early and ongoing local monitoring.\n\n Finally, school closure authority may be exercised at the statewide or local level, so long as decisions are informed by monitoring incidence in local communities and schools.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3532840","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Margaret

sanitizer interventions have been shown to be effective in reducing illness-related absences.\n\n However, while the importance of hand hygiene in schools is clear, the role of instruction in use is less obvious.\n\n The purpose of this study was to compare absenteeism rates among elementary students given access to hand hygiene facilities versus students given both access and short repetitive instruction in use, particularly during influenza season when illness-related absences are at a peak.\n\n\nMethods\nA hand hygiene intervention was implemented from October to May during the 2009/2010 academic year, including peak flu season, in two Chicago Public Elementary Schools among students grades pre-kindergarten to eighth grade (ages 4–14).\n\n Classrooms were systematically assigned to an intervention or control group by grade (cluster design).\n\n Hand hygiene facilities (sanitizer and soap) were made available to all students.\n\n Students in the intervention group also received short repetitive instruction in hand hygiene every 2 months.\n\n Only absences as a result of respiratory or gastrointestinal illness were used to establish illness-related absenteeism rates.\n\n Percent absent days were calculated and bivariate analyses were performed to compare percent absent days among students given access to hand hygiene facilities versus students given both access and instruction.\n\n Prior to the intervention, teachers’ perceptions of students’ hand hygiene were also evaluated.\n\n Teacher perceptions were analysed to describe attitudes and beliefs.\n\n\nResults\nData were collected and analysed for 773 students reporting 1,886 absences during the study period (1.73% of total school days).\n\n Both the percent total absent days and percent illness-related absent days were significantly lower in the group receiving short instruction during flu season (P?=?0.002, P?&lt;?0.001, respectively).\n\n This difference peaked during the influenza season (when intervention began) and declined in the following months.\n\n Teachers (n?=?23) agreed that hand hygiene is not performed properly among students and reported time constraints as a barrier to frequent hand washing.\n\n\nConclusions\nAdding hand hygiene instruction to existing hand hygiene practices improved attendance at public elementary schools during the flu season.\n\n Standardized and brief repetitive instruction in hand hygiene holds potential to significantly reduce absenteeism.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3470997","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Claudia

the impact of school closure on social mixing behaviour and the transmission of close contact infections in eight European countries","abstract":"Background\nMathematical modelling of infectious disease is increasingly used to help guide public health policy.\n\n As directly transmitted infections, such as influenza and tuberculosis, require contact between individuals, knowledge about contact patterns is a necessary pre-requisite of accurate model predictions.\n\n Of particular interest is the potential impact of school closure as a means of controlling pandemic influenza (and potentially other pathogens).\n\n\nMethods\nThis paper uses a population-based prospective survey of mixing patterns in eight European countries to study the relative change in the basic reproduction number (R0 - the average number of secondary cases from a typical primary case in a fully susceptible population) on weekdays versus weekends and during regular versus holiday periods.\n\n The relative change in R0 during holiday periods and weekends gives an indication of the impact collective school closures (and prophylactic absenteeism) may have during a pandemic.\n\n\nResults\nSocial contact patterns differ substantially when comparing weekdays to the weekend and regular to holiday periods mainly due to the reduction in work and/or school contacts.\n\n For most countries the basic reproduction number decreases from the week to weekends and regular to holiday periods by about 21% and 17%, respectively.\n\n However for other countries no significant decrease was observed.\n\n\nConclusion\nWe use a large-scale social contact survey in eight different European countries to gain insights in the relative change in the basic reproduction number on weekdays versus weekends and during regular versus holiday periods.\n\n The resulting estimates indicate that school closure can have a substantial impact on the spread of a newly emerging infectious disease that is transmitted via close (non sexual) contacts.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2799408","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Niel","surname":"Hens","email":"niel.hens@uhasselt.be","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Girma

A standard form was used to abstract information from relevant articles identified from six medical, behavioral and social science literature databases.\n\n We also analyzed data from the National Outbreaks Reporting System (NORS), maintained by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention since 2009, to estimate the frequency of mass gathering-related respiratory disease outbreaks reported to the system.\n\n\nResults\nWe identified 21 published articles describing 72 mass gathering-related respiratory disease outbreaks.\n\n Of these 72, 40 (56%) were associated with agriculture fairs and Influenza A H3N2v following probable swine exposure, and 25 (35%) with youth summer camps and pandemic Influenza A H1N1. Outbreaks of measles (n = 1) and mumps (n = 2) were linked to the international importation of disease.\n\n Between 2009 and 2013, 1,114 outbreaks were reported to NORS, including 96 respiratory disease outbreaks due to Legionella.\n\n None of these legionellosis outbreaks was linked to a mass gathering according to available data.\n\n\nConclusion\nMass gathering-related respiratory disease outbreaks may be uncommon in the United States, but have been reported from fairs (zoonotic transmission) as well as at camps where participants have close social contact in communal housing.\n\n International importation can also be a contributing factor.\n\n NORS collects information on certain respiratory diseases and could serve as a platform to monitor mass gathering-related respiratory

impact of mass gatherings and holiday traveling on the course of an influenza pandemic: a computational model","abstract":"Background\nDuring the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, concerns arose about the potential negative effects of mass public gatherings and travel on the course of the pandemic.\n\n Better understanding the potential effects of temporal changes in social mixing patterns could help public officials determine if and when to cancel large public gatherings or enforce regional travel restrictions, advisories, or surveillance during an epidemic.\n\n\nMethods\nWe develop a computer simulation model using detailed data from the state of Georgia to explore how various changes in social mixing and contact patterns, representing mass gatherings and holiday traveling, may affect the course of an influenza pandemic.\n\n Various scenarios with different combinations of the length of the mass gatherings or traveling period (range: 0.5 to 5 days), the proportion of the population attending the mass gathering events or on travel (range: 1% to 50%), and the initial reproduction numbers R0 (1.3, 1.5, 1.8) are explored.\n\n\nResults\nMass gatherings that occur within 10 days before the epidemic peak can result in as high as a 10% relative increase in the peak prevalence and the total attack rate, and may have even worse impacts on local communities and travelers' families.\n\n Holiday traveling can lead to a second epidemic peak under certain scenarios.\n\n Conversely, mass traveling or gatherings may have little effect when occurring much earlier or later than the epidemic peak, e.\n\ng.\n\n, more than 40 days earlier or 20 days later than the peak when the initial R0 = 1.5.\nConclusions\nOur results suggest that monitoring, postponing, or cancelling large public gatherings may be warranted close to the epidemic peak but not earlier or later during the epidemic.\n\n Influenza activity should also be closely monitored for a potential second peak if holiday traveling occurs when prevalence is high.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3022852","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Pengyi","surname":"Shi","email":"pengyishi@gatech.edu","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pinar","surname":"Keskinocak","email":"pinar@isye.gatech.edu","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Julie

conditions lead to high rates of respiratory infections among the pilgrims, representing a significant cause of morbidity and a major cause of hospitalization.\n Pre- and post-Hajj nasal specimens were prospectively obtained from a paired cohort (692 pilgrims) and from nonpaired cohorts (514 arriving and 470 departing pilgrims) from 13 countries.\n The countries of residence included Africa (44.2%), Asia (40.2%), the United States (8.4%) and Europe (7.2%).\n Nasal specimens were tested for 34 respiratory pathogens using RT-PCR.\n A total of 80 512 PCRs were performed.\n The prevalence of viruses and bacteria increased, from 7.4% and 15.4% before the Hajj to 45.4% and 31.0% after the Hajj, respectively, due to the acquisition of rhinovirus, coronaviruses (229E, HKU1, OC43), influenza A H1N1, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus.\n We did not identify Middle East respiratory coronavirus carriage.\n At arrival, the prevalence of several viruses was clearly dependent on the pilgrim's country of origin.\n After Hajj participation, these viruses were isolated among pilgrims from all countries, with few exceptions.\n No significant differences were observed between paired and nonpaired cohort results.\n Our results strongly suggest that, given the particularly crowded conditions during the rituals, an international mass gathering such as the Hajj may contribute to the globalization of respiratory pathogens after the cross-contamination of pilgrims harbouring pathogens that easily spread among participants.\n Influenza and pneumococcal vaccination, face mask use and hand hygiene should be considered in the context of the Hajj.\n","id":"PMC7129181","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Z.A.","surname":"Memish","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"A.","surname":"Assiri","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"A.","surname":"Turkestani","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"S.","surname":"Yezli","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"M.","surname":"al

employ information on infectious dose and results from mathematical models to assess transmission modes.\n\n\nResults\nDaily inactivation rate constants differ by several orders of magnitude: on inanimate surfaces and in aerosols daily inactivation rates are in the order of 1–102, on hands in the order of 103.\n\n Influenza virus can survive in aerosols for several hours, on hands for a few minutes.\n\n Nasal infectious dose of influenza A is several orders of magnitude larger than airborne infectious dose.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe airborne route is a potentially important transmission pathway for influenza in indoor environments.\n\n The importance of droplet transmission has to be reassessed.\n\n Contact transmission can be limited by fast inactivation of influenza virus on hands and is more so than airborne transmission dependent on behavioral parameters.\n\n However, the potentially large inocula deposited in the environment through sneezing and the protective effect of nasal mucus on virus survival could make contact transmission a key transmission mode.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7112701","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Thomas

pandemic influenza preparedness plans.\n\n Predicting the effectiveness of intervention strategies in a pandemic is difficult.\n\n In the absence of other evidence, computer simulation can be used to help policy makers plan for a potential future influenza pandemic.\n\n We conducted simulations of a small community to determine the magnitude and timing of activation that would be necessary for social distancing interventions to arrest a future pandemic.\n\n\nMethods\nWe used a detailed, individual-based model of a real community with a population of approximately 30,000. We simulated the effect of four social distancing interventions: school closure, increased isolation of symptomatic individuals in their household, workplace nonattendance, and reduction of contact in the wider community.\n\n We simulated each of the intervention measures in isolation and in several combinations; and examined the effect of delays in the activation of interventions on the final and daily attack rates.\n\n\nResults\nFor an epidemic with an R0 value of 1.5, a combination of all four social distancing measures could reduce the final attack rate from 33% to below 10% if introduced within 6 weeks from the introduction of the first case.\n\n In contrast, for an R0 of 2.5 these measures must be introduced within 2 weeks of the first case to achieve a similar reduction; delays of 2, 3 and 4 weeks resulted in final attack rates of 7%, 21% and 45% respectively.\n\n For an R0 of 3.5 the combination of all four measures could reduce the final attack rate from 73% to 16%, but only if introduced without delay; delays of 1, 2 or 3 weeks resulted in final attack rates of 19%, 35% or 63% respectively.\n\n For the higher R0 values no single measure has a significant impact on attack rates.\n\n\nConclusion\nOur results suggest a critical role of social distancing in the potential control of a future pandemic and indicate that such interventions are capable of arresting influenza epidemic development, but only if they are used in combination, activated without delay and maintained for a relatively long period.\n\n\n","id":"PMC2680828","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Joel K","surname":"Kelso","email":"joel@csse.uwa.edu.au","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"George J","surname":"Milne","email":"milne@csse.uwa.edu.au","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Heath","surname":"Kelly","email":"Heath.Kelly@mh.org.au","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.3201/eid1309.070372","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Precautionary Behavior in Response to Perceived Threat of Pandemic Influenza","abstract":"Public transportation was regarded as the most risky place and home as the least risky.\n","id":"PMC2857294","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"M.

diagnostic investigation to establish the microbial etiology of pneumonia is essential to ensure the administration of effective antibiotic therapy to individual patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe evaluated a multiplex PCR assay panel, the FilmArray® pneumonia panel (FilmArray PP, BioFire Diagnostics), for detection of 35 respiratory pathogens and resistance determinants and compared the performance of the standard-of-care test in intensive care unit patients with lower respiratory tract infections.\n\n\nResults\nAmong the 59 endotracheal aspirates and bronchoalveolar lavage specimens obtained from 51 adult patients, FilmArray PP was effective in detecting respiratory bacterial pathogens with an overall positive percent agreement of 90% (95% confidence interval [CI], 73.5–97.9%) and negative percent agreement of 97.4% (95% CI, 96.0–98.4%).\n\n FilmArray PP semi-quantitative reporting demonstrated a concordance rate of 53.6% for the culture-positive specimens and 86.3% for the culture-negative specimens.\n\n FilmArray PP detected 16 viral targets, whereas the conventional viral isolation failed, except influenza A, which showed 100% concordance with PCR.\n\n Coinfections were detected in 42.3% of the specimens.\n\n Substantial discrepancies were observed in identifying antimicrobial resistance gene targets and in the susceptibility testing.\n\n However, FilmArray PP may still be useful at the early stage of pneumonia before culture and susceptibility test reports are available.\n\n Consequently, the results of FilmArray PP might alter the antibiotic prescription in 40.7% of the patients.\n\n\nConclusions\nFilmArray PP offers a rapid and sensitive diagnostic method for lower respiratory tract infections.\n\n However, clinical correlation is advised to determine its significance in interpreting multiple pathogens and detection of genes involved in antimicrobial resistance.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7185395","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Sze

characterisation and epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding","abstract":"Background\nIn late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China.\n\n A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\n\n\nMethods\nWe did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.\n\n Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.\n\n Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.\n\n Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin.\n\n Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.\n\n\nFindings\nThe ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity.\n\n Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).\n\n Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.\n\n Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.\n\n\nInterpretation\n2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus.\n\n Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans.\n\n Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans.\n\n The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and

Cases exported domestically were then estimated.\n\n We forecasted the national and global spread of 2019-nCoV, accounting for the effect of the metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan and surrounding cities, which began Jan 23–24, 2020. We used data on monthly flight bookings from the Official Aviation Guide and data on human mobility across more than 300 prefecture-level cities in mainland China from the Tencent database.\n\n Data on confirmed cases were obtained from the reports published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n Serial interval estimates were based on previous studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV).\n\n A susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered metapopulation model was used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China.\n\n The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credibile interval (CrI).\n\n\nFindings\nIn our baseline scenario, we estimated that the basic reproductive number for 2019-nCoV was 2·68 (95% CrI 2·47–2·86) and that 75?815 individuals (95% CrI 37?304–130?330) have been infected in Wuhan as of Jan 25, 2020. The epidemic doubling time was 6·4 days (95% CrI 5·8–7·1).\n\n We estimated that in the baseline scenario, Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen had imported 461 (95% CrI 227–805), 113 (57–193), 98 (49–168), 111 (56–191), and 80 (40–139) infections from Wuhan, respectively.\n\n If the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV were similar everywhere domestically and over time, we inferred that epidemics are already growing exponentially in multiple major cities of China with a lag time behind the Wuhan outbreak of about 1–2 weeks.\n\n\nInterpretation\nGiven that 2019-nCoV is no longer contained within Wuhan, other major Chinese cities are probably sustaining localised outbreaks.\n\n Large cities overseas with close transport links to China could also become outbreak epicentres, unless substantial public health interventions at both the population and personal levels are implemented immediately.\n\n Independent self-sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally could become

clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings of emerging 2019-nCoV pneumonia in humans.\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\nFifty-one patients (25 men and 26 women; age range 16–76 years) with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction underwent thin-section CT.\n\n The imaging findings, clinical data, and laboratory data were evaluated.\n\n\nResults\nFifty of 51 patients (98%) had a history of contact with individuals from the endemic center in Wuhan, China.\n\n Fever (49 of 51, 96%) and cough (24 of 51, 47%) were the most common symptoms.\n\n Most patients had a normal white blood cell count (37 of 51, 73%), neutrophil count (44 of 51, 86%), and either normal (17 of 51, 35%) or reduced (33 of 51, 65%) lymphocyte count.\n\n CT images showed pure ground-glass opacity (GGO) in 39 of 51 (77%) patients and GGO with reticular and/or interlobular septal thickening in 38 of 51 (75%) patients.\n\n GGO with consolidation was present in 30 of 51 (59%) patients, and pure consolidation was present in 28 of 51 (55%) patients.\n\n Forty-four of 51 (86%) patients had bilateral lung involvement, while 41 of 51 (80%) involved the posterior part of the lungs and 44 of 51 (86%) were peripheral.\n\n There were more consolidated lung lesions in patients 5 days or more from disease onset to CT scan versus 4 days or fewer (431 of 712 lesions vs 129 of 612 lesions; P &lt; .\n\n001).\n\n Patients older than 50 years had more consolidated lung lesions than did those aged 50 years or younger (212 of 470 vs 198 of 854; P &lt; .\n\n001).\n\n Follow-up CT in 13 patients showed improvement in seven (54%) patients and progression in four (31%) patients.\n\n\nConclusion\nPatients with fever and/or cough and with conspicuous ground-glass opacity lesions in the peripheral and posterior lungs on CT images, combined with normal or decreased white blood cells and a history of epidemic exposure, are highly suspected of having 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)

face bacterial, fungal and viral infections in the 21st century","abstract":"Chloroquine (CQ) and its hydroxyl analogue hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) are weak bases with a half-century long use as antimalarial agents.\n Apart from this antimalarial activity, CQ and HCQ have gained interest in the field of other infectious diseases.\n One of the most interesting mechanisms of action is that CQ leads to alkalinisation of acid vesicles that inhibit the growth of several intracellular bacteria and fungi.\n The proof of concept of this effect was first used to restore intracellular pH allowing antibiotic efficacy for Coxiella burnetii, the agent of Q fever, and doxycycline plus HCQ is now the reference treatment for chronic Q fever.\n There is also strong evidence of a similar effect in vitro against Tropheryma whipplei, the agent of Whipple's disease, and a clinical trial is in progress.\n Other bacteria and fungi multiply in an acidic environment and encouraging in vitro data suggest that this concept may be generalised for all intracellular organisms that multiply in an acidic environment.\n For viruses, CQ led to inhibition of uncoating and/or alteration of post-translational modifications of newly synthesised proteins, especially inhibition of glycosylation.\n These effects have been well described in vitro for many viruses, with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) being the most studied.\n Preliminary in vivo clinical trials suggest that CQ alone or in combination with antiretroviral drugs might represent an interesting way to treat HIV infection.\n In conclusion, our review re-emphasises the paradigm that activities mediated by lysosomotropic agents may offer an interesting weapon to face present and future infectious diseases

humans.\n Human-to-human transmissions have been described with incubation times between 2-10 days, facilitating its spread via droplets, contaminated hands or surfaces.\n We therefore reviewed the literature on all available information about the persistence of human and veterinary coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces as well as inactivation strategies with biocidal agents used for chemical disinfection, e.\ng.\n in healthcare facilities.\n The analysis of 22 studies reveals that human coronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus or endemic human coronaviruses (HCoV) can persist on inanimate surfaces like metal, glass or plastic for up to 9 days, but can be efficiently inactivated by surface disinfection procedures with 62–71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite within 1 minute.\n Other biocidal agents such as 0.05–0.2% benzalkonium chloride or 0.02% chlorhexidine digluconate are less effective.\n As no specific therapies are available for SARS-CoV-2, early containment and prevention of further spread will be crucial to stop the ongoing outbreak and to control

deeper understanding of the interaction between Coronaviruses and the innate immune systems of the hosts may shed light on the development and persistence of inflammation in the lungs and hopefully can reduce the risk of lung inflammation caused by CoVs.\n In this review, we provide an update on CoV infections and relevant diseases, particularly the host defense against CoV?induced inflammation

SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study","abstract":"Background\nAn ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.\n\n Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.\n\n We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.\n\n Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.\n\n The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.\n\n\nFindings\nOf 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.\n\n The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever.\n\n 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3–11) days for non-survivors.\n\n Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.\n\n Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax.\n\n 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.\n\n Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.\n\n The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1–2 weeks after ICU admission.\n\n Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.\n\n The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.\n\n\nFunding\nNone.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7102538","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xiaobo","surname":"Yang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yuan","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jiqian","surname":"Xu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Huaqing","surname":"Shu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jia'an","surname":"Xia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yongran","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lu","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhui","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Minghao","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Yu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yaxin","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shangwen","surname":"Pan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaojing","surname":"Zou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shiying","surname":"Yuan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"You","surname":"Shang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Middle

uncertainty regarding the population denominator, especially in health systems where patient registration is not required.\n\n\nMethods\nBased on the observation of a positive association between number of cases reported and number of consultations by the participating general practitioners (GPs), we define several weighted incidence estimators using external information on consultation volume in GPs.\n\n These estimators are applied to data reported in a French primary care surveillance system based on voluntary GPs (the Sentinelles network) for comparison.\n\n\nResults\nDepending on hypotheses for weight computations, relative changes in weekly national-level incidence estimates up to 3% for influenza, 6% for diarrhea, and 11% for varicella were observed.\n\n The use of consultation-weighted estimates led to bias reduction in the estimates.\n\n At the regional level (NUTS2 level - Nomenclature of Statistical Territorial Units Level 2), relative changes were even larger between incidence estimates, with changes between -40% and +55%.\n\n Using bias-reduced weights decreased variation in incidence between regions and increased spatial autocorrelation.\n\n\nConclusions\nPost-stratification using external administrative data may improve incidence estimates in surveillance systems based on voluntary

infection is associated with serious adverse events leading to hospitalization, debilitating complications, and death in elderly individuals.\n Immunization is considered to be the cornerstone for preventing these adverse health outcomes, and vaccination programs are timed to optimize protection during the annual influenza season.\n Trivalent inactivated influenza virus vaccines are believed to be both effective and cost-saving; however, in spite of widespread influenza vaccination programs, rates of hospitalization for acute respiratory illness and cardiovascular diseases have been increasing in this population during recent annual influenza seasons.\n From meta-analyses summarizing estimates of influenza vaccine effectiveness from available observational clinical studies, this review aims to examine how effective current influenza vaccine strategies are in the aging and older adult population and to analyze which are the most important biases that interfere with measurements of influenza vaccine effectiveness.\n Furthermore, consideration is given to strategies that should be adopted in order to optimize influenza vaccine effectiveness in the face of immune

Surveillance Centre (RCGP RSC) is one of the longest established primary care sentinel networks.\n\n In 2015, it established a new data and analysis hub at the University of Surrey.\n\n This paper evaluates the representativeness of the RCGP RSC network against the English population.\n\n\nParticipants and method\nThe cohort includes 1?042?063 patients registered in 107 participating general practitioner (GP) practices.\n\n We compared the RCGP RSC data with English national data in the following areas: demographics; geographical distribution; chronic disease prevalence, management and completeness of data recording; and prescribing and vaccine uptake.\n\n We also assessed practices within the network participating in a national swabbing programme.\n\n\nFindings to date\nWe found a small over-representation of people in the 25–44 age band, under-representation of white ethnicity, and of less deprived people.\n\n Geographical focus is in London, with less practices in the southwest and east of England.\n\n We found differences in the prevalence of diabetes (national: 6.4%, RCPG RSC: 5.8%), learning disabilities (national: 0.44%, RCPG RSC: 0.40%), obesity (national: 9.2%, RCPG RSC: 8.0%), pulmonary disease (national: 1.8%, RCPG RSC: 1.6%), and cardiovascular diseases (national: 1.1%, RCPG RSC: 1.2%).\n\n Data completeness in risk factors for diabetic population is high (77–99%).\n\n We found differences in prescribing rates and costs for infections (national: 5.58%, RCPG RSC: 7.12%), and for nutrition and blood conditions (national: 6.26%, RCPG RSC: 4.50%).\n\n Differences in vaccine uptake were seen in patients aged 2?years (national: 38.5%, RCPG RSC: 32.8%).\n\n Owing to large numbers, most differences were significant (p&lt;0.00015).\n\n\nFuture plans\nThe RCGP RSC is a representative network, having only small differences with the national population, which have now been quantified and can be assessed for clinical relevance for specific studies.\n\n This network is a rich source for research into routine

Mutation in the Egg-Adapted H3N2 Vaccine Strain Not Antigenic Drift in Circulating Viruses","abstract":"Background\nInfluenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) is generally interpreted in the context of vaccine match/mismatch to circulating strains with evolutionary drift in the latter invoked to explain reduced protection.\n\n During the 2012–13 season, however, detailed genotypic and phenotypic characterization shows that low VE was instead related to mutations in the egg-adapted H3N2 vaccine strain rather than antigenic drift in circulating viruses.\n\n\nMethods/Findings\nComponent-specific VE against medically-attended, PCR-confirmed influenza was estimated in Canada by test-negative case-control design.\n\n Influenza A viruses were characterized genotypically by amino acid (AA) sequencing of established haemagglutinin (HA) antigenic sites and phenotypically through haemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay.\n\n H3N2 viruses were characterized in relation to the WHO-recommended, cell-passaged vaccine prototype (A/Victoria/361/2011) as well as the egg-adapted strain as per actually used in vaccine production.\n\n Among the total of 1501 participants, influenza virus was detected in 652 (43%).\n\n Nearly two-thirds of viruses typed/subtyped were A(H3N2) (394/626; 63%); the remainder were A(H1N1)pdm09 (79/626; 13%), B/Yamagata (98/626; 16%) or B/Victoria (54/626; 9%).\n\n Suboptimal VE of 50% (95%CI: 33–63%) overall was driven by predominant H3N2 activity for which VE was 41% (95%CI: 17–59%).\n\n All H3N2 field isolates were HI-characterized as well-matched to the WHO-recommended A/Victoria/361/2011 prototype whereas all but one were antigenically distinct from the egg-adapted strain as per actually used in vaccine production.\n\n The egg-adapted strain was itself antigenically distinct from the WHO-recommended prototype, and bore three AA mutations at antigenic sites B [H156Q, G186V] and D [S219Y].\n\n Conversely, circulating viruses were identical to the WHO-recommended prototype at these positions with other genetic variation that did not affect antigenicity.\n\n VE was 59% (95%CI:16–80%) against A(H1N1)pdm09, 67% (95%CI: 30–85%) against B/Yamagata (vaccine-lineage) and 75% (95%CI: 29–91%) against B/Victoria (non-vaccine-lineage) viruses.\n\n\nConclusions\nThese findings underscore the need to monitor vaccine viruses as well as circulating strains to explain vaccine performance.\n\n Evolutionary drift in circulating viruses cannot be regulated, but influential mutations introduced as part of egg-based vaccine production may be amenable to improvements.\n\n\n","id":"PMC3965421","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Danuta

influenza H3N2 vaccine","abstract":"The effectiveness of the annual influenza vaccine has declined in recent years, especially for the H3N2 component, and is a concern for global public health.\n A major cause for this lack in effectiveness has been attributed to the egg-based vaccine production process.\n Substitutions on the hemagglutinin glycoprotein (HA) often arise during virus passaging that change its antigenicity and hence vaccine effectiveness.\n Here, we characterize the effect of a prevalent substitution, L194P, in egg-passaged H3N2 viruses.\n X-ray structural analysis reveals that this substitution surprisingly increases the mobility of the 190-helix and neighboring regions in antigenic site B, which forms one side of the receptor binding site (RBS) and is immunodominant in recent human H3N2 viruses.\n Importantly, the L194P substitution decreases binding and neutralization by an RBS-targeted broadly neutralizing antibody by three orders of magnitude and significantly changes the HA antigenicity as measured by binding of human serum antibodies.\n The receptor binding mode and specificity are also altered to adapt to avian receptors during egg passaging.\n Overall, these findings help explain the low effectiveness of the seasonal vaccine against H3N2 viruses, and suggest that alternative approaches should be accelerated for producing influenza vaccines as well as isolating clinical isolates.\n","id":"PMC5667890","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Nicholas

to fund a live attenuated influenza vaccine programme for individuals aged 2–16 years.\n\n Mathematical modelling predicts substantial beneficial herd effects for the entire population as a result of reduced influenza transmission.\n\n With a decreased influenza-associated disease burden, existing immunisation programmes might be less cost-effective.\n\n The aim of this study was to assess the epidemiological effect and cost-effectiveness of the existing elderly and risk group vaccination programme under the new policy of mass paediatric vaccination in England.\n\n\nMethods\nFor this cost-effectiveness analysis, we used a transmission model of seasonal influenza calibrated to 14 seasons of weekly consultation and virology data in England and Wales.\n\n We combined this model with an economic evaluation to calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, measured in cost per quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) gained.\n\n\nFindings\nOur results suggest that well timed administration of paediatric vaccination would reduce the number of low-risk elderly influenza cases to a greater extent than would vaccination of the low-risk elderly themselves if the elderly uptake is achieved more slowly.\n\n Although high-risk vaccination remains cost-effective, substantial uncertainty exists as to whether low-risk elderly vaccination remains cost-effective, driven by the choice of cost-effectiveness threshold.\n\n Under base case assumptions and a cost-effectiveness threshold of £15?000 per QALY, the low-risk elderly seasonal vaccination programme will cease to be cost-effective with a mean incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £22?000 per QALY and a probability of cost-effectiveness of 20%.\n\n However, under a £30?000 per QALY threshold, the programme will remain cost-effective with 83% probability.\n\n\nInterpretation\nWith the likely move to decreased cost-effectiveness thresholds, reassessment of existing risk group-based vaccine programme cost-effectiveness in the presence of the paediatric vaccination programme is needed.\n\n\nFunding\nNational Institute for Health Research, the Medical Research

There is limited evidence for vaccine effectiveness (VE) in the populations targeted for influenza vaccination.\n\n The aim of this study is to examine the safety and effectiveness of the live attenuated seasonal influenza vaccine programme in children and the inactivated seasonal influenza vaccination programme among different age and at-risk groups of people.\n\n\nMethods and analysis\nTest negative and cohort study designs will be used to estimate VE.\n\n A primary care database covering 1.25 million people in Scotland for the period 2000/2001 to 2015/2016 will be linked to the Scottish Immunisation Recall Service (SIRS), Health Protection Scotland virology database, admissions to Scottish hospitals and the Scottish death register.\n\n Vaccination status (including LAIV uptake) will be determined from the primary care and SIRS database.\n\n The primary outcome will be influenza-positive real-time PCR tests carried out in sentinel general practices and other healthcare settings.\n\n Secondary outcomes include influenza-like illness and asthma-related general practice consultations, hospitalisations and death.\n\n An instrumental variable analysis will be carried out to account for confounding.\n\n Self-controlled study designs will be used to estimate the risk of adverse events associated with influenza vaccination.\n\n\nEthics and dissemination\nWe obtained approval from the National Research Ethics Service Committee, West Midlands—Edgbaston.\n\n The study findings will be presented at international conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals.\n\n\nTrial registration number\nISRCTN88072400; Pre-results.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5337698","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Colin

introducing universal paediatric influenza vaccination with a quadrivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV).\n The 2015/16 season in the UK was initially dominated by influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and then influenza of B/Victoria lineage, not contained in that season’s adult trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV).\n Overall adjusted end-of-season vaccine effectiveness (VE) was 52.4% (95% confidence interval (CI): 41.0–61.6) against influenza-confirmed primary care consultation, 54.5% (95% CI: 41.6–64.5) against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 54.2% (95% CI: 33.1–68.6) against influenza B.\n In 2–17 year-olds, adjusted VE for LAIV was 57.6% (95% CI: 25.1 to 76.0) against any influenza, 81.4% (95% CI: 39.6–94.3) against influenza B and 41.5% (95% CI: ?8.5 to 68.5) against influenza

These estimates demonstrate moderate to good levels of protection, particularly against influenza B in children, but relatively less against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09.

their long-term value and exploit their potential for health discovery and validation.\n This is especially evident for rare disease research.\n Currently, the rising value of data and bio-specimen collections does not correspond with an equal increase in data/sample-sharing and data/sample access.\n Contradictory legal and ethical frameworks across national borders are obstacles to effective sharing: more specifically, the absence of an integrated model proves to be a major logistical obstruction.\n The Charter intends to amend the obstacle by providing both the ethical foundations on which data sharing should be based, as well as a general Material and Data Transfer Agreement (MTA/DTA).\n This Charter is the result of a careful negotiation of different stakeholders' interest and is built on earlier consensus documents and position statements, which provided the general international legal framework.\n Further to this, the Charter provides tools that may help accelerate sharing.\n The Charter has been formulated to serve as an enabling tool for effective and transparent data and bio-specimen sharing and the general MTA/DTA constitutes a mechanism to ensure uniformity of access across projects and countries, and may be regarded as a consistent basic agreement for addressing data and material sharing globally.\n The Charter is forward looking in terms of emerging issues from the perspective of a multi-stakeholder group, and where possible, provides strategies that may address these

immunity and seroincidence during an influenza pandemic.\n\n Traditionally seroepidemiology studies have used surplus laboratory sera with little or no clinical information or have been expensive detailed population based studies.\n\n We propose collecting population based sera from the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC), a sentinel network with extensive clinical data.\n\n\nAim\nTo pilot a mechanism to undertake population based surveys that collect serological specimens and associated patient data to measure seropositivity and seroincidence due to seasonal influenza, and create a population based serology bank.\n\n\nMethods and analysis\nSetting and Participants: We will recruit 6 RCGP RSC practices already taking nasopharyngeal virology swabs.\n\n Patients who attend a scheduled blood test will be consented to donate additional blood samples.\n\n Approximately 100–150 blood samples will be collected from each of the following age bands – 18– 29, 30– 39, 40– 49, 50– 59, 60– 69 and 70+ years.\n\n\nMethods\nWe will send the samples to the Public Health England (PHE) Seroepidemiology Unit for processing and storage.\n\n These samples will be tested for influenza antibodies, using haemagglutination inhibition assays.\n\n Serology results will be pseudonymised, sent to the RCGP RSC and combined using existing processes at the RCGP RSC secure hub.\n\n The influenza seroprevalence results from the RCGP cohort will be compared against those from the annual PHE influenza residual

Weekly incidence using the ontological definition was 17.93/100,000 (95% CI 15.63-20.41), whereas for the ICD-10 definition the rate was 8.13/100,000 (95% CI 6.70-9.87), and for the RSC definition the rate was 10.24/100,000 (95% CI 8.55-12.12).\n\n Codes from the four supporting concepts were generally consistent across our three IID case definitions: 37.38% (3905/10,448) (95% CI 36.16-38.5) for the ontological definition, 38.33% (2287/5966) (95% CI 36.79-39.93) for the RSC definition, and 40.82% (1933/4736) (95% CI 39.03-42.66) for the ICD-10 definition.\n\n The proportion of laboratory results associated with a positive test result was 19.68% (546/2775).\n\n\nConclusions\nThe standard RCGP RSC definition of IID, and its mapping to ICD-10, underestimates disease incidence.\n\n The ontological approach identified a larger proportion of new IID cases; the ontology divides contributory elements and enables transparency and comparison of rates.\n\n Results illustrate how improved diagnostic coding of IID combined with an ontological approach to case definition would provide a clearer picture of IID in the community, better inform GPs and public health services about circulating disease, and empower them to respond.\n\n We need to improve the Pathology Bounded Code List (PBCL) currently used by laboratories to electronically report results.\n\n Given advances in stool microbiology testing with a move to nonculture, PCR-based methods, the way microbiology results are reported and coded via PBCL needs to be reviewed and modernized.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5639210","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Gunther","surname":"Eysenbach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Samuli","surname":"Pesälä","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Samuli","surname":"Pesälä","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Alexander","surname":"Rodin","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Simon","surname":"de Lusignan","email":"s.lusignan@surrey.ac.uk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Simon","surname":"de Lusignan","email":"s.lusignan@surrey.ac.uk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Stacy","surname":"Shinneman","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Stacy","surname":"Shinneman","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ivelina","surname":"Yonova","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ivelina","surname":"Yonova","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jeremy","surname":"van Vlymen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jeremy","surname":"van Vlymen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Alex J","surname":"Elliot","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Alex J","surname":"Elliot","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Frederick","surname":"Bolton","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Frederick","surname":"Bolton","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gillian E","surname":"Smith","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Gillian E","surname":"Smith","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sarah","surname":"O'Brien","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Sarah","surname":"O'Brien","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1136/bmjhci-2019-100013","date":"2019-05-28","title":"Ontology to identify pregnant women in electronic health records: primary care sentinel network database study","abstract":"Objective\nTo develop an ontology to identify pregnant women from computerised medical record systems with dissimilar coding systems in a primary care sentinel network.\n\n\nMaterials and methods\nWe used a three-step approach to develop our pregnancy ontology in two different coding schemata, one hierarchical and the other polyhierarchical.\n\n We developed a coding system–independent pregnancy case identification algorithm using the Royal College of General Practitioners Research and Surveillance Centre sentinel network database which held 1.8 million patients’ data drawn from 150 primary care providers.\n\n We tested the algorithm by examining individual patient records in a 10% random sample of all women aged 29 in each year from 2004 to 2016.

The virus (2019-nCoV) has spread elsewhere in China and to 24 countries, including South Korea, Thailand, Japan and USA.\n Fortunately, there has only been limited human-to-human transmission outside of China.\n Here, we assess the risk of sustained transmission whenever the coronavirus arrives in other countries.\n Data describing the times from symptom onset to hospitalisation for 47 patients infected early in the current outbreak are used to generate an estimate for the probability that an imported case is followed by sustained human-to-human transmission.\n Under the assumptions that the imported case is representative of the patients in China, and that the 2019-nCoV is similarly transmissible to the SARS coronavirus, the probability that an imported case is followed by sustained human-to-human transmission is 0.41 (credible interval [0.27, 0.55]).\n However, if the mean time from symptom onset to hospitalisation can be halved by intense surveillance, then the probability that an imported case leads to sustained transmission is only 0.012 (credible interval [0, 0.099]).\n This emphasises the importance of current surveillance efforts in countries around the world, to ensure

Weekly incidence using the ontological definition was 17.93/100,000 (95% CI 15.63-20.41), whereas for the ICD-10 definition the rate was 8.13/100,000 (95% CI 6.70-9.87), and for the RSC definition the rate was 10.24/100,000 (95% CI 8.55-12.12).\n\n Codes from the four supporting concepts were generally consistent across our three IID case definitions: 37.38% (3905/10,448) (95% CI 36.16-38.5) for the ontological definition, 38.33% (2287/5966) (95% CI 36.79-39.93) for the RSC definition, and 40.82% (1933/4736) (95% CI 39.03-42.66) for the ICD-10 definition.\n\n The proportion of laboratory results associated with a positive test result was 19.68% (546/2775).\n\n\nConclusions\nThe standard RCGP RSC definition of IID, and its mapping to ICD-10, underestimates disease incidence.\n\n The ontological approach identified a larger proportion of new IID cases; the ontology divides contributory elements and enables transparency and comparison of rates.\n\n Results illustrate how improved diagnostic coding of IID combined with an ontological approach to case definition would provide a clearer picture of IID in the community, better inform GPs and public health services about circulating disease, and empower them to respond.\n\n We need to improve the Pathology Bounded Code List (PBCL) currently used by laboratories to electronically report results.\n\n Given advances in stool microbiology testing with a move to nonculture, PCR-based methods, the way microbiology results are reported and coded via PBCL needs to be reviewed and modernized.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5639210","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Gunther","surname":"Eysenbach","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Samuli","surname":"Pesälä","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Samuli","surname":"Pesälä","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Alexander","surname":"Rodin","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Simon","surname":"de Lusignan","email":"s.lusignan@surrey.ac.uk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Simon","surname":"de Lusignan","email":"s.lusignan@surrey.ac.uk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Stacy","surname":"Shinneman","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Stacy","surname":"Shinneman","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ivelina","surname":"Yonova","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ivelina","surname":"Yonova","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jeremy","surname":"van Vlymen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jeremy","surname":"van Vlymen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Alex J","surname":"Elliot","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Alex J","surname":"Elliot","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Frederick","surname":"Bolton","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Frederick","surname":"Bolton","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gillian E","surname":"Smith","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gillian E","surname":"Smith","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sarah","surname":"O'Brien","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Sarah","surname":"O'Brien","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.5551/jat.29397","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Evaluation of obesity in school-age children","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.14236/jhi.v23i4.920","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Ethnicity Recording in Primary Care Computerised Medical Record Systems: An Ontological Approach","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"English_Indices_of_Deprivation_2015_-_Frequently_Asked_Questions_Dec_2016.pdf URL: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/579151/.

primary care sentinel networks.\n\n In 2015, it established a new data and analysis hub at the University of Surrey.\n\n This paper evaluates the representativeness of the RCGP RSC network against the English population.\n\n\nParticipants and method\nThe cohort includes 1?042?063 patients registered in 107 participating general practitioner (GP) practices.\n\n We compared the RCGP RSC data with English national data in the following areas: demographics; geographical distribution; chronic disease prevalence, management and completeness of data recording; and prescribing and vaccine uptake.\n\n We also assessed practices within the network participating in a national swabbing programme.\n\n\nFindings to date\nWe found a small over-representation of people in the 25–44 age band, under-representation of white ethnicity, and of less deprived people.\n\n Geographical focus is in London, with less practices in the southwest and east of England.\n\n We found differences in the prevalence of diabetes (national: 6.4%, RCPG RSC: 5.8%), learning disabilities (national: 0.44%, RCPG RSC: 0.40%), obesity (national: 9.2%, RCPG RSC: 8.0%), pulmonary disease (national: 1.8%, RCPG RSC: 1.6%), and cardiovascular diseases (national: 1.1%, RCPG RSC: 1.2%).\n\n Data completeness in risk factors for diabetic population is high (77–99%).\n\n We found differences in prescribing rates and costs for infections (national: 5.58%, RCPG RSC: 7.12%), and for nutrition and blood conditions (national: 6.26%, RCPG RSC: 4.50%).\n\n Differences in vaccine uptake were seen in patients aged 2?years (national: 38.5%, RCPG RSC: 32.8%).\n\n Owing to large numbers, most differences were significant (p&lt;0.00015).\n\n\nFuture plans\nThe RCGP RSC is a representative network, having only small differences with the national population, which have now been quantified and can be assessed for clinical relevance for specific studies.\n\n This network is a rich source for research into routine

life.\n\n There is paucity of community based prevalence studies on the disease in India.\n\n This study was planned to assess the prevalence of allergic rhinitis in adults, the proportion of asthmatics among them, risk factors associated and treatment seeking behaviour among the patients.\n\n\nMaterials and Methods:\nA community based cross sectional study was conducted in Mehrauli, South Delhi among 1200 adults, aged 30 years and over selected by systematic random sampling from two randomly selected wards.\n\n A pre-tested questionnaire was used to collect information regarding symptoms, risk factors and treatment seeking behaviour.\n\n Allergic Rhinitis was diagnosed as per ARIA guidelines.\n\n Spirometry was done to diagnose asthma among them.\n\n Multivariate logistic regression analysis was done to find the association of risk factors with disease.\n\n\nResults:\nThe prevalence of Allergic Rhinitis was found to be 11% (132 subjects) and 33.3% (44 patients) among them also had asthma.\n\n Overcrowding (aOR = 6.4), absence of cross-ventilation (aOR = 2.5), occupational exposure to dust/smoke (aOR = 2.1), tobacco smoking (aOR = 2.1), family history of allergic

those without asthma (40%) who, mostly relied on home remedies (42%) or, did not seek any treatment (18%) (P = 0.031).\n\n\nInterpretations and Conclusion:\nThe burden of Allergic Rhinitis is high with a considerable overlap with asthma.\n\n These allergic diseases and emphasize the importance of early and regular

sexually transmitted infections.\n\n Most university students belong to this age group but little is known about their sexual behaviours.\n\n The aim of the study was to explore university students’ perspectives of factors and mechanisms that influence risky sexual behaviours among university students in the United Kingdom.\n\n\nMethods\nAll students at a university in a northern city of England were invited via email to participate in qualitative telephone interviews.\n\n Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim.\n\n Framework analytical approach was used.\n\n\nResults\nTwenty interviews were conducted with a diverse sample of students.\n\n The social context of university lifestyle was perceived to affect risky sex through high levels of alcohol consumption, increased sexual opportunities, liberation from moral surveillance and expectations of the stereotypical highly sexually active student.\n\n Individual and cultural differences were also perceived to account for some patterns of risky sex with older students, overseas students and religious students perceived to be less likely to engage in risky sex due to academic priorities and a tendency to be more likely to adhere to moral values.\n\n Risk denial was also a key factor that led students to engage in risky sex.\n\n Poor access to sexual health services including inconvenient opening times, lack of confidentiality and stigma were perceived to contribute to the limited use of sexually transmitted infections testing and contraceptive services.\n\n\nConclusions\nLifestyle, individual and structural factors seem to play an important role in influencing the risky sexual behaviours of university students.\n\n Therefore preventive interventions that focus on these factors could be very useful in this sub-population of young people.\n\n This study provides useful baseline information that helps us understand how and why some United Kingdom university students engage in risky sexual

hypothesis of a strong environmental effect on the commensal microbiota.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe amount of green environment (forest and agricultural land) around homes was inversely associated with the risk of atopic sensitization in children.\n\n The results indicate that early-life exposure to green environments is especially important.\n\n The environmental effect may be mediated via the effect of environmental microbiota on the commensal microbiota influencing immunotolerance.\n\n\n","id":"PMC4303942","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"L","surname":"Ruokolainen","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"L","surname":"von

virus detection.\n\n\nMethods\nWe compared seven published real-time RT–PCR assays and two new assays that we have developed.\n\n To determine the analytical sensitivity of each assay, we constructed a synthetic universal control ribonucleic acid (uncRNA) containing all of the assays’ target regions on one RNA strand and spiked human blood or urine with known quantities of African or Asian Zika virus strains.\n\n Viral loads in 33 samples from Zika virus-infected patients were determined by using one of the new assays.\n\n\nFindings\nOligonucleotides of the published real-time RT–PCR assays, showed up to 10 potential mismatches with the Asian lineage causing the current outbreak, compared with 0 to 4 mismatches for the new assays.\n\n The 95% lower detection limit of the seven most sensitive assays ranged from 2.1 to 12.1 uncRNA copies/reaction.\n\n Two assays had lower sensitivities of 17.0 and 1373.3 uncRNA copies/reaction and showed a similar sensitivity when using spiked samples.\n\n The mean viral loads in samples from Zika virus-infected patients were 5?×?104 RNA copies/mL of blood and 2?×?104 RNA copies/mL of urine.\n\n\nConclusion\nWe provide reagents and updated protocols for Zika virus detection suitable for the current outbreak strains.\n\n Some published assays might be unsuitable for Zika virus detection, due to the limited sensitivity and potential incompatibility with some strains.\n\n Viral concentrations in the clinical samples were close to the technical detection limit, suggesting that the use of insensitive assays will cause false-negative

severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) during its emergence in humans.\n In spite of intense study, it remains unclear whether the deletion actually reflects adaptation to humans.\n Here we engineered full, partially deleted (?29?nt), and fully deleted ORF8 into a SARS-CoV infectious cDNA clone, strain Frankfurt-1. Replication of the resulting viruses was compared in primate cell cultures as well as Rhinolophus bat cells made permissive for SARS-CoV replication by lentiviral transduction of the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor.\n Cells from cotton rat, goat, and sheep provided control scenarios that represent host systems in which SARS-CoV is neither endemic nor epidemic.\n Independent of the cell system, the truncation of ORF8 (29?nt deletion) decreased replication up to 23-fold.\n The effect was independent of the type I interferon response.\n The 29?nt deletion in SARS-CoV is a deleterious mutation acquired along the initial human-to-human transmission chain.\n The resulting loss of fitness may be due to a founder effect, which has rarely been documented in processes of viral emergence.\n These results have important implications for the retrospective assessment of the threat posed by

important insights into the natural history of past human pandemics.\n For two of these viruses, we have strong evidence suggesting an origin in major livestock species while primordial associations for all four viruses may have existed with bats and rodents.\n HCoV-NL63 and -229E may originate from bat reservoirs as assumed for many other coronaviruses, but HCoV-OC43 and -HKU1 seem more likely to have speciated from rodent-associated viruses.\n HCoV-OC43 is thought to have emerged from ancestors in domestic animals such as cattle or swine.\n The bovine coronavirus has been suggested to be a possible ancestor, from which HCoV-OC43 may have emerged in the context of a pandemic recorded historically at the end of the 19th century.\n New data suggest that HCoV-229E may actually be

admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.\n\n Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.\n\n\nFunding\nMinistry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Beijing

of the severity of coronavirus disease 2019: a model-based analysis","abstract":"Background\nIn the face of rapidly changing data, a range of case fatality ratio estimates for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been produced that differ substantially in magnitude.\n\n We aimed to provide robust estimates, accounting for censoring and ascertainment biases.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected individual-case data for patients who died from COVID-19 in Hubei, mainland China (reported by national and provincial health commissions to Feb 8, 2020), and for cases outside of mainland China (from government or ministry of health websites and media reports for 37 countries, as well as Hong Kong and Macau, until Feb 25, 2020).\n\n These individual-case data were used to estimate the time between onset of symptoms and outcome (death or discharge from hospital).\n\n We next obtained age-stratified estimates of the case fatality ratio by relating the aggregate distribution of cases to the observed cumulative deaths in China, assuming a constant attack rate by age and adjusting for demography and age-based and location-based under-ascertainment.\n\n We also estimated the case fatality ratio from individual line-list data on 1334 cases identified outside of mainland China.\n\n Using data on the prevalence of PCR-confirmed cases in international residents repatriated from China, we obtained age-stratified estimates of the infection fatality ratio.\n\n Furthermore, data on age-stratified severity in a subset of 3665 cases from China were used to estimate the proportion of infected individuals who are likely to require hospitalisation.\n\n\nFindings\nUsing data on 24 deaths that occurred in mainland China and 165 recoveries outside of China, we estimated the mean duration from onset of symptoms to death to be 17·8 days (95% credible interval [CrI] 16·9–19·2) and to hospital discharge to be 24·7 days (22·9–28·1).\n\n In all laboratory confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases from mainland China (n=70?117), we estimated a crude case fatality ratio (adjusted for censoring) of 3·67% (95% CrI 3·56–3·80).\n\n However, after further adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment, we obtained a best estimate of the case fatality ratio in China of 1·38% (1·23–1·53), with substantially higher ratios in older age groups (0·32% [0·27–0·38] in those aged &lt;60 years vs 6·4% [5·7–7·2] in those aged ?60 years), up to 13·4% (11·2–15·9) in those aged 80 years or older.\n\n Estimates of case fatality ratio from international cases stratified by age were consistent with those from China (parametric estimate 1·4% [0·4–3·5] in those aged &lt;60 years [n=360] and 4·5% [1·8–11·1] in those aged ?60 years [n=151]).\n\n Our estimated overall infection fatality ratio for China was 0·66% (0·39–1·33), with an increasing profile with age.\n\n Similarly, estimates of the proportion of infected individuals likely to be hospitalised increased with age up to a maximum of 18·4% (11·0–37·6) in those aged 80 years or older.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThese early estimates give an indication of the fatality ratio across the spectrum of COVID-19 disease and show a strong age gradient in risk of death.\n\n\nFunding\nUK Medical Research

primary care sentinel networks.\n\n In 2015, it established a new data and analysis hub at the University of Surrey.\n\n This paper evaluates the representativeness of the RCGP RSC network against the English population.\n\n\nParticipants and method\nThe cohort includes 1?042?063 patients registered in 107 participating general practitioner (GP) practices.\n\n We compared the RCGP RSC data with English national data in the following areas: demographics; geographical distribution; chronic disease prevalence, management and completeness of data recording; and prescribing and vaccine uptake.\n\n We also assessed practices within the network participating in a national swabbing programme.\n\n\nFindings to date\nWe found a small over-representation of people in the 25–44 age band, under-representation of white ethnicity, and of less deprived people.\n\n Geographical focus is in London, with less practices in the southwest and east of England.\n\n We found differences in the prevalence of diabetes (national: 6.4%, RCPG RSC: 5.8%), learning disabilities (national: 0.44%, RCPG RSC: 0.40%), obesity (national: 9.2%, RCPG RSC: 8.0%), pulmonary disease (national: 1.8%, RCPG RSC: 1.6%), and cardiovascular diseases (national: 1.1%, RCPG RSC: 1.2%).\n\n Data completeness in risk factors for diabetic population is high (77–99%).\n\n We found differences in prescribing rates and costs for infections (national: 5.58%, RCPG RSC: 7.12%), and for nutrition and blood conditions (national: 6.26%, RCPG RSC: 4.50%).\n\n Differences in vaccine uptake were seen in patients aged 2?years (national: 38.5%, RCPG RSC: 32.8%).\n\n Owing to large numbers, most differences were significant (p&lt;0.00015).\n\n\nFuture plans\nThe RCGP RSC is a representative network, having only small differences with the national population, which have now been quantified and can be assessed for clinical relevance for specific studies.\n\n This network is a rich source for research into routine

introducing universal paediatric influenza vaccination with a quadrivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV).\n The 2015/16 season in the UK was initially dominated by influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and then influenza of B/Victoria lineage, not contained in that season’s adult trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV).\n Overall adjusted end-of-season vaccine effectiveness (VE) was 52.4% (95% confidence interval (CI): 41.0–61.6) against influenza-confirmed primary care consultation, 54.5% (95% CI: 41.6–64.5) against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 54.2% (95% CI: 33.1–68.6) against influenza B.\n In 2–17 year-olds, adjusted VE for LAIV was 57.6% (95% CI: 25.1 to 76.0) against any influenza, 81.4% (95% CI: 39.6–94.3) against influenza B and 41.5% (95% CI: ?8.5 to 68.5) against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. These estimates demonstrate moderate to good levels of protection, particularly against influenza B in children, but relatively less against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09.

At the same time and separately, the RCGP RSC’s surveillance has been extended to monitor the temporal and geographical distribution of COVID-19 infection in the community as well as assess the effectiveness of the containment strategy.\n\n\nObjectives\nThe aims of this study are to surveil COVID-19 in both asymptomatic populations and ambulatory cases with respiratory infections, ascertain both the rate and pattern of COVID-19 spread, and assess the effectiveness of the containment policy.\n\n\nMethods\nThe RCGP RSC, a network of over 500 general practices in England, extract pseudonymized data weekly.\n\n This extended surveillance comprises of five components: (1) Recording in medical records of anyone suspected to have or who has been exposed to COVID-19. Computerized medical records suppliers have within a week of request created new codes to support this.\n\n (2) Extension of current virological surveillance and testing people with influenza-like illness or lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI)—with the caveat that people suspected to have or who have been exposed to COVID-19 should be referred to the national containment pathway and not seen in primary care.\n\n (3) Serology sample collection across all age groups.\n\n This will be an extra blood sample taken from people who are attending their general practice for a scheduled blood test.\n\n The 100 general practices currently undertaking annual influenza virology surveillance will be involved in the extended virological and serological surveillance.\n\n (4) Collecting convalescent serum samples.\n\n (5) Data curation.\n\n We have the opportunity to escalate the data extraction to twice weekly if needed.\n\n Swabs and sera will be analyzed in PHE reference laboratories.\n\n\nResults\nGeneral practice clinical system providers have introduced an emergency new set of clinical codes to support COVID-19 surveillance.\n\n Additionally, practices participating in current virology surveillance are now taking samples for COVID-19 surveillance from low-risk patients presenting with LRTIs.\n\n Within the first 2 weeks of setup of this surveillance, we have identified 3 cases: 1 through the new coding system, the other 2 through the extended virology sampling.\n\n\nConclusions\nWe have rapidly converted the established national RCGP RSC influenza surveillance system into one that can test the effectiveness of the COVID-19 containment policy.\n\n The extended surveillance has already seen the use of new codes with 3 cases reported.\n\n Rapid sharing of this protocol should enable scientific critique and shared learning.\n\n\nInternational Registered Report Identifier

Surveillance Centre.\n\n A domain ontology was created and presented in Ontology Web Language (OWL).\n\n The identification and staging of CKD was then carried out using two parallel approaches: (1) clinical coding consistent with a diagnosis of CKD; (2) laboratory-confirmed CKD, based on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) or the presence of proteinuria.\n\n\nResults\nid='Par3'>The study cohort comprised of 1.2 million individuals aged 18 years and over.\n\n 78,153 (6.4%) of the population had CKD on the basis of an eGFR of &lt;?60 mL/min/1.73m2, and a further 7366 (0.6%) individuals were identified as having CKD due to proteinuria.\n\n 19,504 (1.6%) individuals without laboratory-confirmed CKD had a clinical code consistent with the diagnosis.\n\n In addition, a subset of codes allowed for 1348 (0.1%) individuals receiving renal replacement therapy to be identified.\n\n\nConclusions\nid='Par4'>Finding cases of CKD from primary care data using an ontological approach may have greater sensitivity than less comprehensive methods, particularly for identifying those receiving renal replacement therapy or with CKD stages 1 or 2. However, the possibility of inaccurate coding may limit the specificity of this method.\n\n\n","id":"PMC5894169","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Nicholas I.","surname":"Cole","email":"ncole@doctors.org.uk","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Harshana","surname":"Liyanage","email":"h.s.liyanage@surrey.ac.uk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Harshana","surname":"Liyanage","email":"h.s.liyanage@surrey.ac.uk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Rebecca J.","surname":"Suckling","email":"rebecca.suckling@nhs.net","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Pauline A.","surname":"Swift","email":"pauline.swift1@nhs.net","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Hugh","surname":"Gallagher","email":"hugh.gallagher1@nhs.net","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Rachel","surname":"Byford","email":"r.byford@surrey.ac.uk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"John","surname":"Williams","email":"j.g.williams@surrey.ac.uk","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shankar","surname":"Kumar","email":"shankar003@gmail.com","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Simon","surname":"de Lusignan","email":"s.lusignan@surrey.ac.uk","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1136/bmjhci-2019-100013","date":"2019-05-28","title":"Ontology to identify pregnant women in electronic health records: primary care sentinel network database study","abstract":"Objective\nTo develop an ontology to identify pregnant women from computerised medical record systems with dissimilar coding systems in a primary care sentinel network.\n\n\nMaterials and methods\nWe used a three-step approach to develop our pregnancy ontology in two different coding schemata, one hierarchical and the other polyhierarchical.\n\n We developed a coding system–independent pregnancy case identification algorithm using the Royal College of General Practitioners Research and Surveillance Centre sentinel network database which held 1.8 million patients’ data drawn from 150 primary care providers.\n\n We tested the algorithm by examining individual patient records in a 10% random sample of all women aged 29 in each year from 2004 to 2016.

We used multivariable logistic regression models with multiple imputation to identify risk factors for positive SARS-CoV-2 tests within this surveillance network.\n\n\nFindings\nWe identified 3802 SARS-CoV-2 test results, of which 587 were positive.\n\n In multivariable analysis, male sex was independently associated with testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (296 [18·4%] of 1612 men vs 291 [13·3%] of 2190 women; adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1·55, 95% CI 1·27–1·89).\n\n Adults were at increased risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 compared with children, and people aged 40–64 years were at greatest risk in the multivariable model (243 [18·5%] of 1316 adults aged 40–64 years vs 23 [4·6%] of 499 children; adjusted OR 5·36, 95% CI 3·28–8·76).\n\n Compared with white people, the adjusted odds of a positive test were greater in black people (388 [15·5%] of 2497 white people vs 36 [62·1%] of 58 black people; adjusted OR 4·75, 95% CI 2·65–8·51).\n\n People living in urban areas versus

General Practitioners Clinical Informatics Digital Hub: Protocol to Develop Extended COVID-19 Surveillance and Trial Platforms","abstract":"Background\nRoutinely recorded primary care data have been used for many years by sentinel networks for surveillance.\n\n More recently, real world data have been used for a wider range of research projects to support rapid, inexpensive clinical trials.\n\n Because the partial national lockdown in the United Kingdom due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in decreasing community disease incidence, much larger numbers of general practices are needed to deliver effective COVID-19 surveillance and contribute to in-pandemic clinical trials.\n\n\nObjective\nThe aim of this protocol is to describe the rapid design and development of the Oxford Royal College of General Practitioners Clinical Informatics Digital Hub (ORCHID) and its first two platforms.\n\n The Surveillance Platform will provide extended primary care surveillance, while the Trials Platform is a streamlined clinical trials platform that will be integrated into routine primary care practice.\n\n\nMethods\nWe will apply the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) metadata principles to a new, integrated digital health hub that will extract routinely collected general practice electronic health data for use in clinical trials and provide enhanced communicable disease surveillance.\n\n The hub will be findable through membership in Health Data Research UK and European metadata repositories.\n\n Accessibility through an online application system will provide access to study-ready data sets or developed custom data sets.\n\n Interoperability will be facilitated by fixed linkage to other key sources such as Hospital Episodes Statistics and the Office of National Statistics using pseudonymized data.\n\n All semantic descriptors (ie, ontologies) and code used for analysis will be made available to accelerate analyses.\n\n We will also make data available using common data models, starting with the US Food and Drug Administration Sentinel and Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership approaches, to facilitate international studies.\n\n The Surveillance Platform will provide access to data for health protection and promotion work as authorized through agreements between Oxford, the Royal College of General Practitioners, and Public Health England.\n\n All studies using the Trials Platform will go through appropriate ethical and other regulatory approval processes.\n\n\nResults\nThe hub will be a bottom-up, professionally led network that will provide benefits for member practices, our health service, and the population served.\n\n Data will only be used for SQUIRE (surveillance, quality improvement, research, and education) purposes.\n\n We have already received positive responses from practices, and the number of practices in the network has doubled to over 1150 since February 2020. COVID-19 surveillance has resulted in tripling of the number of virology sites to 293 (target 300), which has aided the collection of the largest ever weekly total of surveillance swabs in the United Kingdom as well as over 3000 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) serology samples.\n\n Practices are recruiting to the PRINCIPLE (Platform Randomised trial of INterventions against COVID-19 In older PeopLE) trial, and these participants will be followed up through ORCHID.\n\n These initial outputs demonstrate the feasibility of ORCHID to provide an extended national digital health hub.\n\n\nConclusions\nORCHID will provide equitable and innovative use of big data through a professionally led national primary care network and the application of FAIR principles.\n\n The secure data hub will host routinely collected general practice data linked to other key health care repositories for clinical trials and support enhanced in situ surveillance without always requiring large volume data extracts.\n\n ORCHID will support rapid data extraction, analysis, and dissemination with the aim of improving future research and development in general practice to positively impact patient care.\n\n\nInternational Registered Report Identifier

live corpora to identify new candidate terms for inclusion in the open access and collaborative (OAC) CHV.\n\n\nMethods\nThe CAU system consisted of three main parts: a Web crawler and an HTML parser, a candidate term filter that utilizes natural language processing tools including term recognition methods, and a human review interface.\n\n In evaluation, the CAU system was applied to the health-related social network website PatientsLikeMe.\n\ncom.\n\n The system’s utility was assessed by comparing the candidate term list it generated to a list of valid terms hand extracted from the text of the crawled webpages.\n\n\nResults\nThe CAU system identified 88,994 unique terms 1- to 7-grams (“n-grams” are n consecutive words within a sentence) in 300 crawled PatientsLikeMe.\n\ncom

opportunity to improve public health surveillance.\n In a field that has traditionally relied on an established system of mandatory and voluntary reporting of known infectious diseases by doctors and laboratories to governmental agencies, innovations in social media and so-called user-generated information could lead to faster recognition of cases of infectious disease.\n More direct access to such data could enable surveillance epidemiologists to detect potential public health threats such as rare, new diseases or early-level warnings for epidemics.\n But how useful are data from social media and the Internet, and what is the potential to enhance surveillance? The challenges of using these emerging surveillance systems for infectious disease epidemiology, including the specific resources needed, technical requirements, and acceptability to public health

public health surveillance.\n\n However, staying abreast of current disease outbreaks requires scouring a continually growing number of disparate news sources and alert services, resulting in information overload.\n\n Our objective is to address this challenge through the HealthMap.\n\norg Web application, an automated system for querying, filtering, integrating and visualizing unstructured reports on disease outbreaks.\n\n\nDesign\nThis report describes the design principles, software architecture and implementation of HealthMap and discusses key challenges and future plans.\n\n\nMeasurements\nWe describe the process by which HealthMap collects and integrates outbreak data from a variety of sources, including news media (e.\n\ng.\n\n, Google News), expert-curated accounts (e.\n\ng.\n\n, ProMED Mail), and validated official alerts.\n\n Through the use of text processing algorithms, the system classifies alerts by location and disease and then overlays them on an interactive geographic map.\n\n We measure the accuracy of the classification algorithms based on the level of human curation necessary to correct misclassifications, and examine geographic coverage.\n\n\nResults\nAs part of the evaluation of the system, we analyzed 778 reports with HealthMap, representing 87 disease categories and 89 countries.\n\n The automated classifier performed with 84% accuracy, demonstrating significant usefulness in managing the large volume of information processed by the system.\n\n Accuracy for ProMED alerts is 91% compared to Google News reports at 81%, as ProMED messages follow a more regular structure.\n\n\nConclusion\nHealthMap is a useful free and open resource employing text-processing algorithms to identify important disease outbreak

prognostic modelling studies, as it can properly account for the missing data uncertainty.\n\n The multiply imputed datasets are each analysed using standard prognostic modelling techniques to obtain the estimates of interest.\n\n The estimates from each imputed dataset are then combined into one overall estimate and variance, incorporating both the within and between imputation variability.\n\n Rubin's rules for combining these multiply imputed estimates are based on asymptotic theory.\n\n The resulting combined estimates may be more accurate if the posterior distribution of the population

data and prediction: the pattern submodel","abstract":"Missing data are a common problem for both the construction and implementation of a prediction algorithm.\n Pattern submodels (PS)—a set of submodels for every missing data pattern that are fit using only data from that pattern—are a computationally efficient remedy for handling missing data at both stages.\n Here, we show that PS (i) retain their predictive accuracy even when the missing data mechanism is not missing at random (MAR) and (ii) yield an algorithm that is the most predictive among all standard missing data strategies.\n Specifically, we show that the expected loss of a forecasting algorithm is minimized when each pattern-specific loss is minimized.\n Simulations and a re-analysis of the SUPPORT study confirms that PS generally outperforms zero-imputation, mean-imputation, complete-case analysis, complete-case submodels, and even multiple imputation (MI).\n The degree of improvement is highly dependent on the missingness mechanism and the effect size of missing predictors.\n When the data are MAR, MI can yield comparable forecasting performance but generally requires a larger computational cost.\n We also show that predictions from the PS approach are equivalent to the limiting predictions for a MI procedure that is dependent on missingness indicators (the MIMI model).\n The focus of

of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the province.\n\n\nMethods\nEpidemiological data were obtained from the websites of China's Bureau of Health and the People's Government of Jiangsu Province and informal online sources from January 22 to February 20, 2020.\nResults\nThe cumulative number of patients in Jiangsu Province (over 79 million people) was 613. The number of daily confirmed new cases reached the inflection point on January 31 with the maximum of 39 cases.\n\n The temporal number of patients peaked from January 29 to February 9. The proportion of confirmed cases who were residents or travelers to Hubei Province was 100.0%–58.8% before January 31 and then gradually declined.\n\n The proportion of close contacts increased gradually from January 27 to February 17. The geographical distribution of COVID-2019 cases showed that all 13 cites reported confirmed new cases after only five days of the first confirmed new case in Suzhou.\n\n The cases were concentrated in Nanjing, Suzhou, and Xuzhou with a high population density (over eight million people).\n\n The epidemiological features of COVID-2019 cases in Wuxi, Jiangsu showed that seven confirmed cases were tourists from others areas beyond Hubei Province.\n\n The longest incubation period of COVID-2019 was 19 days based on the onset of laboratory-confirmed cases.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe number of daily confirmed new cases in Jiangsu Province peaked around January 31 and then declined.\n\n This result emphasized that wartime control measures, such as putting cities on lockdown to limit population mobility in Jiangsu Province, resulted in dramatic reductions in COVID-19

retrospective cohort study","abstract":"Background\nRapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China, prompted heightened surveillance in Shenzhen, China.\n\n The resulting data provide a rare opportunity to measure key metrics of disease course, transmission, and the impact of control measures.\n\n\nMethods\nFrom Jan 14 to Feb 12, 2020, the Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention identified 391 SARS-CoV-2 cases and 1286 close contacts.\n\n We compared cases identified through symptomatic surveillance and contact tracing, and estimated the time from symptom onset to confirmation, isolation, and admission to hospital.\n\n We estimated metrics of disease transmission and analysed factors influencing transmission risk.\n\n\nFindings\nCases were older than the general population (mean age 45 years) and balanced between males (n=187) and females (n=204).\n\n 356 (91%) of 391 cases had mild or moderate clinical severity at initial assessment.\n\n As of Feb 22, 2020, three cases had died and 225 had recovered (median time to recovery 21 days; 95% CI 20–22).\n\n Cases were isolated on average 4·6 days (95% CI 4·1–5·0) after developing symptoms; contact tracing reduced this by 1·9 days (95% CI 1·1–2·7).\n\n Household contacts and those travelling with a case were at higher risk of infection (odds ratio 6·27 [95% CI 1·49–26·33] for household contacts and 7·06 [1·43–34·91] for those travelling with a case) than other close contacts.\n\n The household secondary attack rate was 11·2% (95% CI 9·1–13·8), and children were as likely to be infected as adults (infection rate 7·4% in children &lt;10 years vs population average of 6·6%).\n\n The observed reproductive number (R) was 0·4 (95% CI 0·3–0·5), with a mean serial interval of 6·3 days (95% CI 5·2–7·6).\n\n\nInterpretation\nOur data on cases as well as their infected and uninfected close contacts provide key insights into the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. This analysis shows that isolation and contact tracing reduce the time during which cases are infectious in the community, thereby reducing the R.\n\n The overall impact of isolation and contact tracing, however, is uncertain and highly dependent on the number of asymptomatic cases.\n\n Moreover, children are at a similar risk of infection to the general population, although less likely to have severe symptoms; hence they should be considered in analyses of transmission and control.\n\n\nFunding\nEmergency Response Program of Harbin Institute of Technology, Emergency Response Program of Peng Cheng Laboratory, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7185944","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Qifang","surname":"Bi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yongsheng","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shujiang","surname":"Mei","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Chenfei","surname":"Ye","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xuan","surname":"Zou","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Zhen","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiaojian","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Lan","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Shaun A","surname":"Truelove","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tong","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Wei","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Cong","surname":"Cheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiujuan","surname":"Tang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Xiaoliang","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yu","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Binbin","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Suli","surname":"Huang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Yu","surname":"Sun","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Juncen","surname":"Zhang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Ting","surname":"Ma","email":"tma@hit.edu.cn","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Justin","surname":"Lessler","email":"justin@jhu.edu","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tiejian","surname":"Feng","email":"fengtiej@126.com","contributions":"1"}],"References depth 2":[{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Early transmission dynamics in Wuhan, China, of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical characteristics of 138 hospitalized patients with 2019 novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia in Wuhan, China","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1101/2020.02.10.20021675","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Epidemiological and clinical features of the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak in China","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) situation reports","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.7326/M20-0504","date":"1970-01-01","title":"The Incubation Period of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) From Publicly Reported Confirmed Cases: Estimation and Application","abstract":"Background:\nA novel human coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified in China in December 2019.

China","abstract":"Background\nSince December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7092819","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Wei-jie","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng-yi","surname":"Ni","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng-yi","surname":"Ni","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yu","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wen-hua","surname":"Liang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chun-quan","surname":"Ou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jian-xing","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Shan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chun-liang","surname":"Lei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"David S.C.","surname":"Hui","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Bin","surname":"Du","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lan-juan","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Guang","surname":"Zeng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Kwok-Yung","surname":"Yuen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ru-chong","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chun-li","surname":"Tang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Tao","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ping-yan","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jie","surname":"Xiang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shi-yue","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jin-lin","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zi-jing","surname":"Liang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yi-xiang","surname":"Peng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Li","surname":"Wei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yong","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ya-hua","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Peng","surname":"Peng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jian-ming","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ji-yang","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhong","surname":"Chen","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Gang","surname":"Li","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhi-jian","surname":"Zheng","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shao-qin","surname":"Qiu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jie","surname":"Luo","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chang-jiang","surname":"Ye","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Shao-yong","surname":"Zhu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Nan-shan","surname":"Zhong","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical features predicting mortality risk in patients with viral pneumonia: the MuLBSTA Score","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical courses and outcomes of hospitalized adult patients with seasonal influenza in Korea, 2011-2012: Hospital-based Influenza Morbidity &amp;

about the health sequelae of pneumonia in persons with chronic kidney disease (CKD).\n\n\nMethods\nWe studied adults with CKD in Stockholm during 2006–11, who not previously been diagnosed with lower respiratory tract infections.\n\n We used multivariable-adjusted Cox regression with pneumonia as a time-varying exposure to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) [95% confidence intervals (CIs)] for the events of death, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), acute kidney injury (AKI), CKD progression or hospitalization for urinary tract infections (UTIs)/sepsis.\n\n Cataract and knee/joint replacement served as negative control outcomes.\n\n\nResults\nWe identified 71 931 adults (mean age 79?years, 59% women), of whom 8379 (12%) were diagnosed with pneumonia during follow-up; incident pneumonia was associated with 10 times higher adjusted mortality risk during the first 90?days [HR = 10.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 9.5–10.5] and double the mortality beyond 90?days from pneumonia diagnosis (HR = 2.0; 95% CI 1.9–2.1).\n\n Incident pneumonia was similarly associated with higher adjusted risk of MACE (&lt;90?days: HR = 12.6; 95% CI 12.0–13.3; ?90?days: HR = 1.5; 95% CI 1.4–1.6).\n\n The adjusted risk of CKD progression and UTI/sepsis hospitalization was highest within 90?days from pneumonia but remained elevated thereafter.\n\n For AKI, the association with incident pneumonia was only seen within 90?days.\n\n Neither cataract nor knee/joint replacement was related to pneumonia.\n\n\nConclusions\nIncident pneumonia was associated with increased risks of MACE, CKD progression, severe UTI/sepsis and death, with risks highest soon after pneumonia diagnosis but extending beyond 90?days.\n\n Our findings highlight the susceptibility for adverse outcomes of CKD patients following pneumonia diagnosis, and may inform clinical decisions regarding vaccination strategies.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7643674","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Guobin","surname":"Su","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Marco","surname":"Trevisan","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Junichi","surname":"Ishigami","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Kunihiro","surname":"Matsushita","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Kunihiro","surname":"Matsushita","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Cecilia","surname":"Stålsby

By extracting and analyzing all available published clinical data, we identified several major clinical characteristics associated with increased disease severity and mortality among patients with COVID-19. Specifically, preexisting chronic conditions such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes are strongly associated with an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19; surprisingly, however, we found no correlation between chronic liver disease and increased disease severity.\n In addition, we found that both acute cardiac injury and acute kidney injury are highly correlated with an increased risk of COVID-19-related mortality.\n Given the high risk of comorbidity and the high mortality rate associated with tissue damage, organ function should be monitored closely in patients diagnosed with COVID-19, and this approach should be included when establishing new guidelines for managing these high-risk patients.\n Moreover, additional clinical data are needed in order to determine whether a supportive therapy can help mitigate the development of severe, potentially fatal complications, and further studies are needed to identify the pathophysiology and the mechanism underlying this novel coronavirus-associated infectious disease.\n Taken together, these findings provide new insights regarding clinical strategies for improving the management and outcome of patients with COVID-19.","id":"PMC7187729","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Xinhui","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuexian","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xuexian","surname":"Fang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhaoxian","surname":"Cai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zhaoxian","surname":"Cai","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaotian","surname":"Wu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaotong","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Xiaotong","surname":"Gao","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Junxia","surname":"Min","email":"junxiamin@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Junxia","surname":"Min","email":"junxiamin@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fudi","surname":"Wang","email":"fwang@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fudi","surname":"Wang","email":"fwang@zju.edu.cn","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa2002032","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Clinical Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China","abstract":"Background\nSince December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020.

severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was confirmed between February 21 and March 11, 2020, were matched to 30,759 beneficiaries of the Regional Health Service (controls) according to sex, age, and municipality of residence.\n\n Information about the use of selected drugs and patients’ clinical profiles was obtained from regional databases of health care use.\n\n Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for associations between drugs and infection, with adjustment for confounders, were estimated by means of logistic regression.\n\n\nResults\nAmong both case patients and controls, the mean (±SD) age was 68±13 years, and 37% were women.\n\n The use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs was more common among case patients than among controls, as was the use of other

treated with these medications and in untreated patients, overall and in those with hypertension, after propensity-score matching for receipt of each medication class.\n\n A difference of at least 10 percentage points was prespecified as a substantial difference.\n\n\nResults\nAmong 12,594 patients who were tested for Covid-19, a total of 5894 (46.8%) were positive; 1002 of these patients (17.0%) had severe illness.\n\n A history of hypertension was present in 4357 patients (34.6%), among whom 2573 (59.1%) had a positive test; 634 of these patients (24.6%) had severe illness.\n\n There was no association between any single medication class and an increased likelihood of a positive test.\n\n None of the medications examined was associated with a substantial increase in the risk of severe illness among patients who tested positive.\n\n\nConclusions\nWe found no substantial increase in the likelihood of a positive test for Covid-19 or in the risk of severe Covid-19 among patients who tested positive in association with five common classes of antihypertensive medications.\n\n\n","id":"PMC7206932","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Harmony

inhibitors might influence the severity of COVID-19. We aimed to evaluate whether continuing versus discontinuing renin–angiotensin system inhibitors (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers) affects outcomes in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19.\nMethods\nThe REPLACE COVID trial was a prospective, randomised, open-label trial done at 20 large referral hospitals in seven countries worldwide.\n\n Eligible participants were aged 18 years and older who were admitted to hospital with COVID-19 and were receiving a renin–angiotensin system inhibitor before admission.\n\n Individuals with contraindications to continuation or discontinuation of renin–angiotensin system inhibitor therapy were excluded.\n\n Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to continuation or discontinuation of their renin–angiotensin system inhibitor using permuted block randomisation, with allocation concealed using a secure web-based randomisation system.\n\n The primary outcome was a global rank score in which participants were ranked across four hierarchical tiers incorporating time to death, duration of mechanical ventilation, time on renal replacement or vasopressor therapy, and multiorgan dysfunction during the hospitalisation.\n\n Primary analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population.\n\n The REPLACE COVID trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.\n\ngov, NCT04338009.\n\n\nFindings\nBetween March 31 and Aug 20, 2020, 152 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to either continue or discontinue renin–angiotensin system inhibitor therapy (continuation group n=75; discontinuation group n=77).\n\n Mean age of participants was 62 years (SD 12), 68 (45%) were female, mean body-mass index was 33 kg/m2 (SD 8), and 79 (52%) had diabetes.\n\n Compared with discontinuation of renin–angiotensin system inhibitors, continuation had no effect on the global rank score (median rank 73 [IQR 40–110] for continuation vs 81 [38–117] for discontinuation; ?-coefficient 8 [95% CI ?13 to 29]).\n\n There were 16 (21%) of 75 participants in the continuation arm versus 14 (18%) of 77 in the discontinuation arm who required intensive care unit admission or invasive mechanical ventilation, and 11 (15%) of 75 participants in the continuation group versus ten (13%) of 77 in the discontinuation group died.\n\n 29 (39%) participants in the continuation group and 28 (36%) participants in the discontinuation group had at least one adverse event (?2 test of adverse events between treatment groups p=0·77).\n\n There was no difference in

have necessitated an update to the guideline.\n The PRISMA 2020 statement replaces the 2009 statement and includes new reporting guidance that reflects advances in methods to identify, select, appraise, and synthesise studies.\n The structure and presentation of the items have been modified to facilitate implementation.\n In this article, we present the PRISMA 2020 27-item checklist, an expanded checklist that details reporting recommendations for each item, the PRISMA 2020 abstract checklist, and the revised flow diagrams for original and updated reviews.\n","id":"PMC8005924","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Matthew J","surname":"Page","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Joanne

severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was confirmed between February 21 and March 11, 2020, were matched to 30,759 beneficiaries of the Regional Health Service (controls) according to sex, age, and municipality of residence.\n\n Information about the use of selected drugs and patients’ clinical profiles was obtained from regional databases of health care use.\n\n Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for associations between drugs and infection, with adjustment for confounders, were estimated by means of logistic regression.\n\n\nResults\nAmong both case patients and controls, the mean (±SD) age was 68±13 years, and 37% were women.\n\n The use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs was more common among case patients than among controls, as was the use of other

December 2019, the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has rapidly spread and overwhelmed healthcare systems worldwide, urging physicians to understand how to manage this novel infection.\n Early in the pandemic, more severe forms of COVID-19 have been observed in patients with cardiovascular comorbidities, who are often treated with renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS)-blockers, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), but whether these are indeed independent risk factors is unknown.\n The cellular receptor for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the membrane-bound angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), as for SARS-CoV(-1).\n Experimental data suggest that expression of ACE2 may be increased by RAAS-blockers, raising concerns that these drugs may facilitate viral cell entry.\n On the other hand, ACE2 is a key counter-regulator of the RAAS, by degrading angiotensin II into angiotensin (1-7), and may thereby mediate beneficial effects in COVID-19. These considerations have raised concerns about the management of these drugs, and early comments shed vivid controversy among physicians.\n This review will describe the homeostatic balance between ACE-angiotensin II and ACE2-angiotensin (1-7) and summarize the pathophysiological rationale underlying the debated role of the RAAS and its modulators in the context of the pandemic.\n In addition, we will review available evidence investigating the impact of RAAS blockers on the course and prognosis of COVID-19 and discuss why retrospective observational studies should be interpreted with caution.\n These considerations highlight the importance of solid evidence-based data in order to guide physicians in the management of RAAS-interfering drugs in the general population as well as in patients with more or less severe forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n","id":"PMC7937723","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Simon B.","surname":"Gressens","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Georges","surname":"Leftheriotis","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Jean-Claude","surname":"Dussaule","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Martin","surname":"Flamant","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Bernard I.","surname":"Levy","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Emmanuelle","surname":"Vidal-Petiot","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.ejim.2021.09.007","date":"2021-09-14","title":"The pivotal link between ACE2 deficiency and SARS-CoV-2 infection: One year later","abstract":"","id":"PMC8450306","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Fabio","surname":"Angeli","email":"NULL","contributions":"8"},{"firstname":"Martina","surname":"Zappa","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Gianpaolo","surname":"Reboldi","email":"NULL","contributions":"5"},{"firstname":"Monica","surname":"Trapasso","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Claudio","surname":"Cavallini","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Antonio","surname":"Spanevello","email":"NULL","contributions":"5"},{"firstname":"Paolo","surname":"Verdecchia","email":"NULL","contributions":"7"}]},{"doi":"10.1016/j.ejim.2020.04.037","date":"2020-04-16","title":"The pivotal link between ACE2 deficiency and SARS-CoV-2 infection","abstract":"Angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptors mediate the entry into the cell of three strains of coronavirus: SARS-CoV, NL63 and SARS-CoV-2. ACE2 receptors are ubiquitous and widely expressed in the heart, vessels, gut, lung (particularly in type 2 pneumocytes and macrophages), kidney, testis and brain.\n ACE2 is mostly bound to cell membranes and only scarcely present in the circulation in a soluble form.\n An important salutary function of membrane-bound and soluble ACE2 is the degradation of angiotensin II to angiotensin1-7.\n Consequently, ACE2 receptors limit several detrimental effects resulting from binding of angiotensin II to AT1 receptors, which include vasoconstriction, enhanced inflammation and thrombosis.\n The increased generation of angiotensin1-7 also triggers counter-regulatory protective effects through binding to G-protein coupled Mas receptors.\n Unfortunately, the entry of SARS-CoV2 into the cells through membrane fusion markedly down-regulates ACE2 receptors, with loss of the catalytic effect of these receptors at the external site of the membrane.\n Increased pulmonary inflammation and coagulation have been reported as unwanted effects of enhanced and unopposed angiotensin II effects via the ACE?Angiotensin II?AT1 receptor axis.\n Clinical reports of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 show that several features associated with infection and severity of the disease (i.\ne.\n, older age, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease) share a variable degree of ACE2 deficiency.\n We suggest that ACE2 down-regulation induced by viral invasion may be especially detrimental in people with baseline ACE2 deficiency associated with the above conditions.\n The additional ACE2 deficiency after viral invasion might amplify the dysregulation between the ‘adverse’ ACE?Angiotensin II?AT1 receptor axis and the ‘protective’ ACE2?Angiotensin1-7?Mas receptor axis.\n In the lungs, such dysregulation would favor the progression of inflammatory and thrombotic processes triggered by local angiotensin II hyperactivity unopposed by angiotensin1-7.\n In this setting, recombinant ACE2, angiotensin1-7 and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers could be promising therapeutic approaches in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n","id":"PMC7167588","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Paolo","surname":"Verdecchia","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Claudio","surname":"Cavallini","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Antonio","surname":"Spanevello","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Fabio","surname":"Angeli","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.120.15353","date":"1970-01-01","title":"COVID-19: ACE2centric Infective Disease?","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1080/14656566.2021.1990264","date":"2021-10-04","title":"Pharmacotherapy for hypertensive urgency and emergency in COVID-19 patients","abstract":"Introduction\nHypertension is a common chronic disorder in patients hospitalized for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n\n Furthermore, an exaggerated cardiovascular response with persistently raised blood pressure during hospitalization seems independently associated with in-hospital all-cause mortality, intensive care unit admission and heart failure.\n\n However, the real burden of elevated blood pressure during the acute phase of COVID-19 remains undefined.\n\n\nAreas covered\nThe authors review the available evidence on the pharmacotherapy for the treatment of acute elevations in blood pressure (including hypertensive urgency and emergency) in COVID-19 patients.\n\n\nExpert opinion\nAcute elevations in blood pressure and unstable in-hospital blood pressure may be associated with organ damage and worse outcome in patients with COVID-19.

This includes patients with hypertension, heart disease, diabetes mellitus, and clearly the elderly.\n Many of those patients are treated with renin-angiotensin system blockers.\n Because the ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) protein is the receptor that facilitates coronavirus entry into cells, the notion has been popularized that treatment with renin-angiotensin system blockers might increase the risk of developing a severe and fatal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection.\n The present article discusses this concept.\n ACE2 in its full-length form is a membrane-bound enzyme, whereas its shorter (soluble) form circulates in blood at very low levels.\n As a mono-carboxypeptidase, ACE2 contributes to the degradation of several substrates including angiotensins I and II.\n ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors do not inhibit ACE2 because ACE and ACE2 are different enzymes.\n Although angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers have been shown to upregulate ACE2 in experimental animals, the evidence is not always consistent and differs among the diverse angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers and differing organs.\n Moreover, there are no data to support the notion that ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker administration facilitates coronavirus entry by increasing ACE2 expression in either animals or humans.\n Indeed, animal data support elevated ACE2 expression as conferring potential protective pulmonary and cardiovascular effects.\n In summary, based on the currently available evidence, treatment with renin-angiotensin system blockers should not be discontinued because of concerns with coronavirus infection.\n","id":"PMC7225046","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"A.H.

for Biological Age Acceleration and Telomere Shortening in COVID-19 Survivors","abstract":"The SARS-CoV-2 infection determines the COVID-19 syndrome characterized, in the worst cases, by severe respiratory distress, pulmonary and cardiac fibrosis, inflammatory cytokine release, and immunosuppression.\n This condition has led to the death of about 2.15% of the total infected world population so far.\n Among survivors, the presence of the so-called persistent post-COVID-19 syndrome (PPCS) is a common finding.\n In COVID-19 survivors, PPCS presents one or more symptoms: fatigue, dyspnea, memory loss, sleep disorders, and difficulty concentrating.\n In this study, a cohort of 117 COVID-19 survivors (post-COVID-19) and 144 non-infected volunteers (COVID-19-free) was analyzed using pyrosequencing of defined CpG islands previously identified as suitable for biological age determination.\n The results show a consistent biological age increase in the post-COVID-19 population, determining a DeltaAge acceleration of 10.45 ± 7.29 years (+5.25 years above the range of normality) compared with 3.68 ± 8.17 years for the COVID-19-free population (p &lt; 0.0001).\n A significant telomere shortening parallels this finding in the post-COVID-19 cohort compared with COVID-19-free subjects (p &lt; 0.0001).\n Additionally, ACE2 expression was decreased in post-COVID-19 patients, compared with the COVID-19-free population, while DPP-4 did not change.\n In light of these observations, we hypothesize that some epigenetic alterations are associated with the post-COVID-19 condition, particularly in younger patients (&lt; 60 years).\n","id":"PMC8201243","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Alessia","surname":"Mongelli","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Veronica","surname":"Barbi","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Veronica","surname":"Barbi","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Michela","surname":"Gottardi

and its importance is further emphasized in the context of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection referred to as COVID-19. Patients with severe COVID-19 infections commonly are older and have a history of hypertension.\n Almost 75% of patients who have died in the pandemic in Italy had hypertension.\n This raised multiple questions regarding a more severe course of COVID-19 in relation to hypertension itself as well as its treatment with renin–angiotensin system (RAS) blockers, e.\ng.\n angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs).\n We provide a critical review on the relationship of hypertension, RAS, and risk of lung injury.\n We demonstrate lack of sound evidence that hypertension per se is an independent risk factor for COVID-19. Interestingly, ACEIs and ARBs may be associated with lower incidence and/or improved outcome in patients with lower respiratory tract infections.\n We also review in detail the molecular mechanisms linking the RAS to lung damage and the potential clinical impact of treatment with RAS blockers in patients with COVID-19 and a high cardiovascular and renal risk.\n This is related to the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells, and expression of ACE2 in the lung, cardiovascular system, kidney, and other tissues.\n In summary, a critical review of available evidence does not support a deleterious effect of RAS blockers in COVID-19 infections.\n Therefore, there is currently no reason to discontinue RAS blockers in stable patients facing the COVID-19 pandemic.\n ","id":"PMC7184480","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Reinhold","surname":"Kreutz","email":"reinhold.kreutz@charite.de","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Engi Abd El-Hady","surname":"Algharably","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Engi Abd El-Hady","surname":"Algharably","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Michel","surname":"Azizi","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Piotr","surname":"Dobrowolski","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Tomasz","surname":"Guzik","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Tomasz","surname":"Guzik","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Andrzej","surname":"Januszewicz","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Alexandre","surname":"Persu","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Aleksander","surname":"Prejbisz","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Aleksander","surname":"Prejbisz","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Thomas Günther","surname":"Riemer","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Thomas Günther","surname":"Riemer","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Ji-Guang","surname":"Wang","email":"NULL","contributions":"1"},{"firstname":"Michel","surname":"Burnier","email":"NULL","contributions":"2"},{"firstname":"Michel","surname":"Burnier","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"}]},{"doi":"10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.120.15595","date":"1970-01-01","title":"ACE2 (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2) in Cardiopulmonary Diseases: Ramifications for the Control of SARS-CoV-2","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1515/cclm-2021-0658","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Ageing, ACE2 deficiency and bad outcome in COVID-19","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1097/HJH.0000000000002859","date":"1970-01-01","title":"SARS-CoV-2 infection and ACE2 inhibition","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Hypertension after COVID-19 vaccination","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers and severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by coronavirus","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"RAAS Inhibitors and Risk of COVID-19","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1161/hq0102.102277","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Effect of angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockade on cardiac remodeling in angiotensin II type 2 receptor null mice","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"10.1161/hc4601.099404","date":"1970-01-01","title":"Roles of angiotensin II type 2 receptor stimulation associated with selective angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockade with valsartan in the improvement of inflammation-induced vascular injury","abstract":"Unknown Abstract","id":"not found","idformat":"N/A","foundapis":"","miscinfo":"","authors":[]},{"doi":"NULL","date":"1970-01-01","title":"International union of pharmacology.

novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\n\n We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.\n\n\nMethods\nAll patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.\n\n We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.\n\n Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.\n\n Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.\n\n Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.\n\n\nFindings\nBy Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).\n\n Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0).\n\n 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.\n\n One family cluster was found.\n\n Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).\n\n Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]).\n\n 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.\n\n All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.\n\n Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]).\n\n 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.\n\n Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF?.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar

urgent threat to global health.\n This study was conducted to provide the international community with a deeper understanding of this new infectious disease.\n Epidemiological, clinical features, laboratory findings, radiological characteristics, treatment, and clinical outcomes of 135 patients in northeast Chongqing were collected and analyzed in this study.\n A total of 135 hospitalized patients with COVID?19 were enrolled.\n The median age was 47 years (interquartile range, 36?55), and there was no significant gender difference (53.3% men).\n The majority of patients had contact with people from the Wuhan area.\n Forty?three (31.9%) patients had underlying disease, primarily hypertension (13 [9.6%]), diabetes (12 [8.9%]), cardiovascular disease (7 [5.2%]), and malignancy (4 [3.0%]).\n Common symptoms included fever (120 [88.9%]), cough (102 [76.5%]), and fatigue (44 [32.5%]).\n Chest computed tomography scans showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs of all the patients.\n All patients received antiviral therapy (135 [100%]) (Kaletra and interferon were both used), antibacterial therapy (59 [43.7%]), and corticosteroids (36 [26.7%]).\n In addition, many patients received traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) (124 [91.8%]).\n It is suggested that patients should receive Kaletra early and should be treated by a combination of Western and Chinese medicines.\n Compared to the mild cases, the severe ones had lower lymphocyte counts and higher plasma levels of Pt, APTT, d?dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, PCT, ALB, C?reactive protein, and aspartate aminotransferase.\n This study demonstrates the clinic features and therapies of 135 COVID?19 patients.\n Kaletra and TCM played an important role in the treatment of the viral pneumonia.\n

Pathways in the MMPs Activation and Progression of Lung Injury Induced by Cigarette Smoke Exposure in ACE2 Knockout Mice","abstract":"Inflammation-mediated abnormalities in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are implicated in the pathogenesis of lung injury.\n Angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2), an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) homologue that displays antagonist effects on ACE/angiotensin II (Ang II) axis, could also play a protective role against lung diseases.\n However, the relationship between ACE2 and MMPs activation in lung injury is still largely unclear.\n The purpose of this study is to investigate whether MMPs activity could be affected by ACE2 and which ACE2 derived signaling pathways could be also involved via using a mouse model with lung injury induced by cigarette smoke (CS) exposure for 1 to 3 weeks.\n Wild-type (WT; C57BL/6) and ACE2 KO mice (ACE2-/-) were utilized to study CS-induced lung injury.\n Increases in the resting respiratory rate (RRR), pulmonary immunokines, leukocyte infiltration and bronchial hyperplasia were observed in the CS-exposed mice.\n Compared to WT mice, more serious physiopathological changes were found in ACE2-/- mice in the first week of CS exposure.\n CS exposure increased pulmonary ACE and ACE2 activities in WT mice, and significantly increased ACE in ACE2-/- mice.\n Furthermore, the activity of pulmonary MMPs was decreased in CS-exposed WT mice, whereas this activity was increased in ACE2-/- mice.\n CS exposure increased the pulmonary p-p38, p-JNK and p-ERK1/2 level in all mice.\n In ACE2-/- mice, a significant increase p-STAT3 signaling was detected; however, no effect was observed on the p-STAT3 level in WT mice.\n Our results support the hypothesis that ACE2 deficiency influences MMPs activation and STAT3 phosphorylation signaling to promote more pulmonary inflammation in the development of lung

hospitalized cohort with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19.\nMethods\nPatients with COVID-19 admitted to 1 of 5 Mount Sinai Health System hospitals in New York City between February 27, 2020, and April 12, 2020, with troponin-I (normal value &lt;0.03 ng/ml) measured within 24 h of admission were included (n = 2,736).\n\n Demographics, medical histories, admission laboratory results, and outcomes

diffuse alveolar damage with severe capillary congestion and variegated findings in lungs and other organs suggesting vascular dysfunction","abstract":"Aims\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID?19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS?CoV?2), has rapidly evolved into a sweeping pandemic.\n\n Its major manifestation is in the respiratory tract, and the general extent of organ involvement and the microscopic changes in the lungs remain insufficiently characterised.\n\n Autopsies are essential to elucidate COVID?19?associated organ alterations.\n\n\nMethods and results\nThis article reports the autopsy findings of 21 COVID?19 patients hospitalised at the University Hospital Basel and at the Cantonal Hospital Baselland, Switzerland.\n\n An in?corpore technique was performed to ensure optimal staff safety.\n\n The primary cause of death was respiratory failure with exudative diffuse alveolar damage and massive capillary congestion, often accompanied by microthrombi despite anticoagulation.\n\n Ten cases showed superimposed bronchopneumonia.\n\n Further findings included pulmonary embolism (n = 4), alveolar haemorrhage (n = 3), and vasculitis (n = 1).\n\n Pathologies in other organ systems were predominantly attributable to shock; three patients showed signs of generalised and five of pulmonary thrombotic microangiopathy.\n\n Six patients were diagnosed with senile cardiac amyloidosis upon autopsy.\n\n Most patients suffered from one or more comorbidities (hypertension, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes mellitus).\n\n Additionally, there was an overall predominance of males and individuals with blood group A (81% and 65%, respectively).\n\n All relevant histological slides are linked as open?source scans in supplementary files.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis study provides an overview of postmortem findings in COVID?19 cases, implying that hypertensive, elderly, obese, male individuals with severe cardiovascular comorbidities as well as those with blood group A may have a lower threshold of tolerance for COVID?19. This provides a pathophysiological explanation for higher mortality rates among these

individuals with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); and to evaluate risk factors for all-cause in-hospital mortality.\n\n\nMethods\nThis retrospective study from a University tertiary care hospital in northern Italy, included hospitalized adult patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 between 25 February 2020 and 25 March 2020.\nResults\nOverall, 317 individuals were enrolled.\n\n Their median age was 71 years and 67.2% were male (213/317).\n\n The most common underlying diseases were hypertension (149/317; 47.0%), cardiovascular disease (63/317; 19.9%) and diabetes (49/317; 15.5%).\n\n Common symptoms at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis included fever (285/317; 89.9%), shortness of breath (167/317; 52.7%) and dry cough (156/317; 49.2%).\n\n An ‘atypical’ presentation including at least one among mental confusion, diarrhoea or nausea and vomiting was observed in 53/317 patients (16.7%).\n\n Hypokalaemia occurred in 25.8% (78/302) and 18.5% (56/303) had acute kidney injury.\n\n During hospitalization, 111/317 patients (35.0%) received non-invasive respiratory support, 65/317 (20.5%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and 60/317 (18.5%) required invasive mechanical ventilation.\n\n All-cause in-hospital mortality, assessed in 275 patients, was 43.6% (120/275).\n\n On multivariable analysis, age (per-year increase OR 1.07; 95% CI 1.04–1.10; p &lt; 0.001),

in-hospital mortality.\n\n\nConclusions\nCOVID-19 mainly affected elderly patients with predisposing conditions and caused severe illness, frequently requiring non-invasive respiratory support or ICU admission.\n\n Despite supportive care, COVID-19 remains associated with a substantial risk of all-cause in-hospital

hospital).\n\n We next obtained age-stratified estimates of the case fatality ratio by relating the aggregate distribution of cases to the observed cumulative deaths in China, assuming a constant attack rate by age and adjusting for demography and age-based and location-based under-ascertainment.\n\n We also estimated the case fatality ratio from individual line-list data on 1334 cases identified outside of mainland China.\n\n Using data on the prevalence of PCR-confirmed cases in international residents repatriated from China, we obtained age-stratified estimates of the infection fatality ratio.\n\n Furthermore, data on age-stratified severity in a subset of 3665 cases from China were used to estimate the proportion of infected individuals who are likely to require hospitalisation.\n\n\nFindings\nUsing data on 24 deaths that occurred in mainland China and 165 recoveries outside of China, we estimated the mean duration from onset of symptoms to death to be 17·8 days (95% credible interval [CrI] 16·9–19·2) and to hospital discharge to be 24·7 days (22·9–28·1).\n\n In all laboratory confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases from mainland China (n=70?117), we estimated a crude case fatality ratio (adjusted for censoring) of 3·67% (95% CrI 3·56–3·80).\n\n However, after further adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment, we obtained a best estimate of the case fatality ratio in China of 1·38% (1·23–1·53), with substantially higher ratios in older age groups (0·32% [0·27–0·38] in those aged &lt;60 years vs 6·4% [5·7–7·2] in those aged ?60 years), up to 13·4% (11·2–15·9) in those aged 80 years or older.\n\n Estimates of case fatality ratio from international cases stratified by age were consistent with those from China (parametric estimate 1·4% [0·4–3·5] in those aged &lt;60 years [n=360] and 4·5% [1·8–11·1] in those aged ?60 years [n=151]).\n\n Our estimated overall infection fatality ratio for China was 0·66% (0·39–1·33), with an increasing profile with age.\n\n Similarly, estimates of the proportion of infected individuals likely to be hospitalised increased with age up to a maximum of 18·4% (11·0–37·6) in those aged 80 years or older.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThese early estimates give an indication of the fatality ratio across the spectrum of COVID-19 disease and show a strong age gradient in risk of death.\n\n\nFunding\nUK

disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female.\n\n The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died.\n\n Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife.\n\n Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city.\n\n The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%).\n\n Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%).\n\n The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).\n\n On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%).\n\n No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease.\n\n Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.\n\n\nConclusions\nDuring the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.\n\n Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.\n\n (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and others.\n\n)\n","id":"PMC7092819","idformat":"PMC","foundapis":"_PMC","miscinfo":"","authors":[{"firstname":"Wei-jie","surname":"Guan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng-yi","surname":"Ni","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Zheng-yi","surname":"Ni","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Yu","surname":"Hu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Wen-hua","surname":"Liang","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chun-quan","surname":"Ou","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Jian-xing","surname":"He","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Lei","surname":"Liu","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Hong","surname":"Shan","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"Chun-liang","surname":"Lei","email":"NULL","contributions":"0"},{"firstname":"David
